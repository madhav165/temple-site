https://www.bharattemples.com/devi-kanyakumari-kanyakumari/,"Kumari Devi is believed to be an incarnation of Goddess Parvati. Parvati Mata took the birth of Kumari Devi to kill the demon named Banasura.
The Kumari Amman temple situated in Kanyakumari has Maa Bhagawati Durga in its sanctum sanctorum.  What’s unique about this holy spot is that it firmly prohibits men from entering its premises at any time. Only sanyasis (celibate men) are permitted to proceed to the gate, whereas married men are not permitted to enter.
With Goddess Bhagawati as the reigning deity of the temple, it’s believed to be one of the 52 Shakti Peethas. As per the puranas, the right shoulder and spine area of Sati’s corpse fell at this spot, which is housed inside the Kanya Kumari temple. Another legend says that Goddess Parvati was supposedly treated disrespectfully by Lord Shiva at this site on the day of their wedding, and male entry remains restricted here to date.
It is said that Maa Parvati went to a lonely site in the mid of the ocean for Tapasya. She tried very hard Tapasya for getting Lord Shiva as her husband. So in this temple, only women are allowed, men are prohibited there. This is a famous temple of Kanya Kumari, where Kanya Maa Bhagawati Durga is worshipped by women only.
The Kumari Amman temple was built during the reign of the Pandya dynasty. It was later rebuilt by the Vijayanagara, Chola and Nayaka kings. A pavilion of sixteen pillars is built in the temple. 
The main deity of the temple, Devi Kumari is facing east. The idol shows Goddess as a young girl with a garland. The nose-ring of the deity is known for its extraordinary lustre. There are many tales related to it as well.
The eastern gate of the temple is kept closed on most of the days. It is opened only on special occasions and days such as new moon days during the month of Vrischikam, Edavam and Karkidakam.
There is a well inside the temple from where water is used for the consecration of the goddess. This is known as Moola Ganga Theertham.
In great Hindu epic Mahabharata and Ramayana, Kumari Amman Temple has been mentioned. Even in the Sangam works such as Manimekalai and Purananooru, there is mention of this temple.
According to the legend behind the Kanyakumari Temple, demon Banasura had captured all devas and kept them in his cruel captivity. As per the boon, he could be killed only by a virgin girl. Hence, upon devas prayers and pleadings, Goddess Parasakthi took the form of Kumari, the virgin girl so as to kill the demon.
With time, Lord Shiva fell in love with Kumari and the arrangements for their celestial wedding were made. Sage Narada, who was aware of the fact that demon Banasura can be killed only if the Goddess remains unmarried, tried to cancel the wedding in many ways. When he couldn’t succeed and the marriage time was fixed for midnight, he devised a plan. On the day when Lord Shiva started his journey for the wedding, from Suchindram at Valukkuparai to Kanyakumari, Sage Narada took the form of a cock. He crowed to misleadingly indicate the onset of the morning. Lord Shiva, hearing the cock, returned back, thinking that the auspicious time of wedding had passed, while the Goddess was left waiting for him. Later, Goddess decided to remain unmarried.
However, when demon Banasura, mesmerised by the Goddess’s beauty, tried to marry her forcibly, she annihilated him with her Chakra Gadha, as well as freeing devas from his capture. Later, Banasura asked Goddess for mercy and prayed to her to absolve his sins. Goddess forgave him and blessed the water of holy confluence. It is said that whoever takes a dip in the waters here, washes off his/her sins.
As per the legend, Saint Narada and Lord Parasurama requested the goddess to stay on earth till the end of Kaliyuga. Lord Parasuram later constructed a temple by the side of the ocean; he then installed an idol of the Goddess Kanya Kumari. The shores around the temple have around 25 theerthams. Another holy place near the temple is Sripada Parai, also known as Vivekananda Rock Memorial. Imprints of Goddess’s feet can be seen on the rock.
 Vaisakhi Festival which is mostly celebrated in the month of May is the most important festival of the temple. It is celebrated for a span of 10 days. During this festival, the utsava idol of Goddess Kumari also takes part in various processions of the festival.
Other important festivals of the temple are Navaratri Festival, Float Festival, Chitra Purnima Utsav, Car Festival and Kalabham (Sandal) festival.
Tourists can reach Devi Kanyakumari Temple easily as it is easily accessible by road. Tourists can take auto rickshaws or taxi to the temple. There are also city buses that one can take to reach here.
This temple is at a distance of 1 km away from Kanyakumari Bus Stop as well as quite close to the Kanyakumari Railway Station which is also around 1 km away.

Lord Shiva asked the sage to build a temple at the base of the hill and promised that he would reside there forever.
Another popular legend tells the story of the temple’s main deity, Lord Annamalaiyar, and his consort, Goddess Unnamulai Amman. The legend states that Lord Annamalaiyar and Goddess Unnamulai Amman were once separated and that Lord Annamalaiyar was in a deep depression without her. To cheer him up, Lord Vishnu, in the form of a hunter, suggested to Lord Annamalaiyar that he should search for a suitable place to build a temple for Goddess Unnamulai Amman. Eventually, Lord Annamalaiyar chose the base of the Annamalai hills, and he and Goddess Unnamulai Amman were reunited.
Another popular legend is that Lord Shiva appeared as a column of fire on the top of Annamalai hills during the Karthigai deepam festival, which is celebrated every year in the Tamil month of Karthigai (November – December).

https://www.bharattemples.com/lord-veeraraghava-perumal-temple-thiruvallur/,"The legend connected with the origin of this temple shows that once upon a time, in Krita Yuga, a sage by name Purupunyar lived with his wife Satyavathi in Badarikashram. They had no children. Purupanyar performed a Sali Yajna. (Putrakameshti Yaga) with great fervor and devotion. The Sage offered 1000 Ahutis (oblations of gheeto the sacrificial fire after chanting the mantra each time) every day, for one full year. ‘On the last day, when Purnahuti (the final offering) was performed, Lord Narayana was pleased with the austerity of the ritualistic observances of the Sage, and appeared in the sacrificial fire in a blissful mood to offer boons. The Sage prayed for a noble son.The boon was granted with the condition that he should be named after the name of the Yajna as Salihotran. With this blessing, Lord Narayana disappeared. Then the Sage collected the ash strewn around the Yajna Peetha and gave a handful of it to his consort to take in with great veneration as Prasadam. In the tenth month after that, a glorious son was born to Sage Purupunyar.
The child was named Salihotran as ordained by Lord Narayana. With the growth of years, the child showed signs of precocity and started on a pilgrimage-visiting temple after temple. On Tai Amavasya day (New Moon day in January-February), he reached Tiruvallur where he found that Lord Brahma, other Devas and great sages like Vasishtha, were engaged in taking bath in the Hrittapanasini tank.

No Hindu’s journey is complete without a pilgrimage to both Varanasi and Rameswaram for the culmination of his quest for salvation and is hallowed by the epic ‘Ramayana’. Folklore mentions about God Ram’s presence in this land, after his 14-year exile.
Local legend has it that Shri Ram was helped back into Rameswaram and into India by his brother Lakshman and Hanuman along with his band of thousands of monkeys, after finally emerging victorious against the demon – Ravana. They helped build a bridge with rocks from the sea and shores to cross the ‘Sethu canal’ and reach Lanka. Lord Rama is also believed to have sanctified this place by worshipping and glorifying Lord Shiva and hence marks the confluence of Shaivism and Vaishnavism and is thus revered by both Shaivites and Vaishnavites alike and thus there is a strong belief that bathing in the 22 ‘Theerthams’ or natural springs is a step forward in enlightenment. Therefore, Rameswaram has rightly been declared as one of the National Pilgrim Centres in the count.
The Ramanathaswamy temple by itself is a delight for every tourist. With its magnificent, imposing structure, long corridors, aesthetically carved pillars, the temple is adorned with a towering 38-metre ‘Gopuram’. The temple itself was built by rulers since the 12th century with Sethupathy Maravar beginning the construction of the grand Ramanathaswamy temple that boasts of the ‘Third Corridor’, completed by his successor, Maravar – the longest one in Asia with a 197-metre span from East to West and a 133-metre span from South to North, the third largest in the world!

https://www.bharattemples.com/arulmigu-dhandayuthapani-swamy-temple-dindigul/,"Palani Arulmigu Shri Dhandayuthapani temple is one of the Six Abodes of Murugan. It is located in the town of Palani in Dindigul district, 100 kilometres (62 mi) southeast of Coimbatore and northwest of Madurai in the foot-hills of the Palani hills, Tamil Nadu, India.
The idol of the Muruga in Palani, was created and consecrated by sage Bogar, one of aaseevaham’s (Ancient Tamil Culture) eighteen great siddhas out of an amalgam of nine poisons or navapashanam. The legend also holds that, the sculptor had to work very rapidly to complete its features, but that he spent so much time in creating the face, he did not have time to bestow but a rough grace upon the rest of the body, thus explaining the contrast between the artistic perfection of the face and the slightly less accomplished work upon the body. A shrine to Bhogar exists in the southwestern corridor of the temple, which, by legend, is said to be connected by a subterranean tunnel to a cave in the heart of the hill, where Bhogar continues to meditate and maintain his vigil, with eight idols of Muruga.
The idol of the deity is said to be made of an amalgam of nine poisonous substances which forms an eternal medicine when mixed in a certain ratio. It is placed upon a pedestal of stone, with an archway framing it and represents the god Subrahmanya in the form He assumed at Palani – that of a very young recluse, shorn of his locks and all his finery, dressed in no more than a loincloth and armed only with a staff, the dhandam, as befits a monk.
Sage Narada once visited the celestial court of Shiva at Mount Kailash to present to him a fruit, the gyana-palam (literally, the fruit of knowledge), that held in it the elixir of wisdom. Upon Shiva expressing his intention of dividing the fruit between his two sons, Ganesha and Murugan,the sage counseled against cutting it. He decided to award it to whichever of his two sons first circled the world thrice. Accepting the challenge, Karthikeya started his journey around the globe on his mount peacock. However, Ganesha, who surmised that the world was no more than his parents Shiva and Shakti combined, circumambulated them. Pleased with their son’s discernment, Shiva awarded the fruit to Ganesha. When Kartikeya returned, he was furious to learn that his efforts had been in vain. He left Kailash and took up his abode in Palani hills in South India.

It was built by Chola King Kopperunjingan who ruled between 1229 and 1278. This Temple is on the outskirts of the city of Chidambaram. Legend says that Goddess Kaali Devi moved here after losing to Lord Siva in the celestial dance contest.
It was an argument that who is superior, either ‘Sivam’ (Lord Siva) or Shakthi (Parvathi). In order to resolve thus, they performed a dance program at Chidambaram in front of Lord Vishnu, Lord Brahma and other deities. While they were playing dance, Lord Siva was about to be defeated.
But knowing fully well Siva played “Oorthuva Taandava” i.e. raising one leg above his head. This “Oorthuva Taandava” is one of the posture in the dance. It could not be played by the women folk due to their modesty and shyness. In this Parvathi could not play equally well to this posture and agreed her defeat. She had to go outside the borders of the town in order to contain her haughtiness and to teach a lesson that Sivam and Shakthi are both equally important in our life.
‘Thillai Kali’ is a deity in anger. This anger was pacified by Brahma by Chanting Veda and also praising her. Because of the penance of Lord Brahma ‘Kali’ became cool. So that Goddess ‘Thillai Amman’ in this temple seems with four faces.

https://www.bharattemples.com/shore-temple-kanchipuram-tamil-nadu/,"Shore Temple, Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu
The Shore Temple (built in 700–728 AD) is so named because it overlooks the shore of the Bay of Bengal. It is a structural temple, built with blocks of granite, dating from the 8th century AD. At the time of its creation, the site was a busy port during the reign of Narasimhavarman II of the Pallava dynasty. As one of the Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram, it has been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1984.It is one of the oldest structural (versus rock-cut) stone temples of South India
Shore Temple is also acknowledged for being the first stone structure made by Pallavas. Before this, the monuments used to be carved out of the rocks or stones. Unlike other monuments of the region, Shore Temple is a five-storied rock-cut structural temple more willingly than monolithical. In southern India, this is one amongst the earliest and most important structural temples. The spire is extensively decorated with carvings and sculptures. In the recent years, a stone wall has been constructed to protect the shrine from further sea-erosion.
Perched on a 50 feet square plinth, the pyramidal structure raises to the extent of 60 feet. Presenting a typical specimen of Dravidian temple architecture, Shore Temple generates an exclusive combination of history and natural splendor. The temple was designed to grasp the first rays of the rising sun and to spotlight the waters after sunset. In the words of Percy Brown, Shore Temple served as “a landmark by day and a beacon by night”.
Shore Temple comprises three shrines, where the prominent ones are dedicated to Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. In the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum), an image of Shivalinga embraces the site. At the rear end, one can find two shrines facing each other. Here, one shrine is dedicated to Ksatriyasimnesvara and other to Lord Vishnu. In the shrine, Lord Vishnu is imaged reclining on the ‘Seshanag’, which is a symbol of consciousness in Hinduism.
The exterior wall of the shrine to Lord Vishnu and the internal side of the boundary wall are elaborately carved and sculptured. The images on the sculpted panels depict scenes from everyday life. However, the sculptures are incredibly real and artistic. The exterior walls of the temple are segregated by plasters into bays, where the lower part has been impressed into a series of nurturing lions. The archeological department has excavated certain other figures from the site.
Shore Temple is no more a living temple. The structure of the temple makes one to contemplate and perhaps, it was erected basically as a work of art. The Pallavas were known to be the great patrons of art and were keen to create their own style of temple architecture. In the present day, Shore Temple makes the background of Mahabalipuram Dance Festival that is held in Jan /Feb every year. The festival was organized to promote the traditional dance as well as tourism in Mahabalipuram.
Marco Polo and the European merchants that came to Asia after him called the site Seven Pagodas. One of these is believed to be the Shore Temple. The temple probably acted as a landmark for navigation of their ships. As it appears like a Pagoda, the name became familiar to the seafarers. This structural temple complex was the culmination of the architectural creations that were initiated by the King Narasimhavarman II in mid 7th century starting with the Cave temples and the monolithic Rathas.Even though the architectural creation of sculpturing cut-in and cut-out structures continued during subsequent periods, as seen in the Atiranachanda cave, the Pidari rathas and the Tiger cave, the main credit for the architectural elegance of the Shore Temple complex in the category of structural temples goes to the King Rajasimha (700–28 AD), also known as Narasimhavarman II, of the Pallava Dynasty. It is now inferred that this temple complex was the last in a series of temples that seemed to exist in the submerged coastline; this is supported by the appearance of an outline of its sister temples off the coast during the Tsunami of 2004 which struck this coastline. The architecture of the Shore Temple was continued by the Cholas (in the temples that they built) who ruled Tamil Nadu after defeating the Pallavas. The tsunami of December 2004 that struck the coastline of Coromandel exposed an old collapsed temple built entirely of granite blocks. This has renewed speculation that Mahablaipuram was a part of the Seven Pagodas described in the diaries of Europeans, of which six temples remain submerged in the sea. The tsunami also exposed some ancient rock sculptures of lions, elephants, and peacocks that used to decorate walls and temples during the Pallava period during the 7th and 8th centuries. Though the tsunami of 26 December 2004 that occurred in the Indian Ocean struck the temple and the surrounding garden, the Shore Temple was not badly damaged, as the water level returned to its normal level within a few minutes. The damage was to the foundation of the bali peetam (sacrificial altar) in front of the temple, the steps leading to the boat jetty, and the small shrine with the Varaha (Boar) sculpture at the basement of the Shore temple. As the temple foundation is on hard granite rock, it could sustain the waves created by the tsunami; the groynes erected around the temple area on the coastline also aided its protection. According to the two inscriptions found in the slab of smaller Shiva temple, the names of the three temples mentioned are as Kshatriyasimha Pallaveshvara-griham, Rajasimha Pallaveshvara-griham and Pllikondaruliya-devar. The entire temple complex is called as Jalashayana (lying in water). This confirms that the Vishnu shrine was the first shrine to be excavated here. The inscription on the lintel of the Vishnu shrine also mentions this as Narapatisimha Pallava Vishnu Griha where Narapatisimha is a title of Rajasimha. An archaeologist has observed that: “In locating the temple on the very margin of the sea, exposing it to avoidable dangers, the builders, there can be little doubt, sought theatrical effect.As the Shore Temple was initially identified as part of the Seven Pagodas at Mahabalipuram, an ancient Hindu legend referred to the origin of these pagodas in mythical terms. Prince Hiranyakasipu refused to worship the god Vishnu. The prince’s son, Prahlada, loved and was devoted to Vishnu greatly and criticized his father’s lack of faith. Hiranyakasipu banished Prahlada but then relented and allowed him to come home. Father and son quickly began to argue about Vishnu’s nature. When Prahlada stated that Vishnu was present everywhere, including in the walls of their home, his father kicked a pillar. Vishnu emerged from the pillar in the form of a man with a lion’s head, and killed Hiranyakasipu. Prahlada eventually became the king, and had a grandson named Bali. Bali founded Mahabalipuram on this site.

Srivilliputhur Andal temple (also called Srivilliputtur Divya Desam) in Srivilliputhur, a town in Virudhunagar district in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, is dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu. It is located 80 km from Madurai. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th–9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Vatapatrasayi and his consort Lakshmi as Andal. It is believed to be the birthplace of two of the Azhwars, namely Periazhwar and his foster daughter Andal.
The temple is associated with the life of Andal, who was found under a Tulsi plant in the garden inside the temple by Periazhwar. She is believed to have worn the garland before dedicating it to the presiding deity of the temple. Periazhwar, who later found it, was highly upset and stopped the practise. It is believed Vishnu appeared in his dream and asked him to dedicate the garland worn by Andal to him daily, which is a practise followed during the modern times. It is also believed that Ranganatha of Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple married Andal, who later merged with him.
The temple has two divisions – the one of Andal located on the Southwest and the second one of Vatapatrasayi on the Northeast direction. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines, the garden where Andal is believed to have been born and two of its three bodies of water. The Vijayanagar and Nayak kings commissioned paintings on the walls of the shrine of temple, some of which are still present.
Samprokshanam of the Andal temple was performed on 20 January 2016 by Tamil Nadu Government.
Vatapatrasayi is believed to have appeared to Andal, Periazhwar and sages Markandeya and Bhrigu. The temple follows Thenkalaitradition of worship. Six daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Aadipooram festival, the birthday of Andal, celebrated during the Tamil month of Adi (July – August), is the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.

A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines, the garden where Andal was found and two of its three bodies of water. The rajagopuram, the temple’s gateway tower, 192 ft (59 m) tall. The tower is originally believed to have been built by Periazhwar with the prize money he obtained from religious debates in the court of Vallaba Pandya in Madurai.

The history of Srivilliputhur centres around the Srivilliputhur Andal Temple, dedicated to Andal.[7] It is argued that the temple of Vatapatrasayi is present from the 8th century, but there are epigraphic records are available only from the 10th century. The view that the Andal temple was built during the 14th century is highly debated. The temple has inscriptions from Chola, Pandya and Nayak rulers, spanning across various centuries from the 10th to 16th centuries. As per some accounts, the original structure was constructed by Tribuvana Chakravarthy Konerinmai Kondan Kulasekaran and the Andal temple by Barathi Rayar.
During the reign of Thirumalai Nayak (1623–1659) and Rani Mangammal (1689–1706), this city became very popular. Thirumalai Nayak renovated all the temples of this city. He installed choultaries, temple tanks, paintings and golden towers inside the temple. The sculptures in the hall leading to the shrine of Andal were also built by him. From 1751 to 1756 A.D., Then it fell into the hands of Mohammed Yousoof Khan. Until 1850, Sri Andal temple was under the care of the king of Trivancore. The British ruled the country till India attained freedom in 1947. The temple’s gateway tower, 192 ft (59 m) tall and it is believe that this is the official symbol of the Government of Tamil Nadu (Sri Vatapatrasayi Temple Tower).But the artist who designed the emblem for the state of Tamil Nadu Thiru.Krishna Rao denied that it is not the temple of Srivilliputhur rather it is Meenakshi Temple’s West Gopuram. During the modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.
As per mythological legend, the place was referred as Varaha Kshetra. It was a dense forest named Champaka where the sages Bhrgu and Markandeya were doing penance and had their hermitages in the place. A demon named Kalanerai was troubling the sages and they prayed to Vishnu to relieve them from the demon. Vishnu was pleased by their devotion and appeared in the place to slay the demon. He is believed to have taken the abode in the forest reclining on Adisesha, his serpent bed, on the leaf of a banyan tree. The place thus came to be known as Vadaveshwarapuram.
Periazhwar (originally called Vishnuchittar) was an ardent devotee of Vishnu and he used to string garland to Vishnu every day. He was childless and he prayed to Vishnu to save him from the longing. One day, he found a girl child under a Tulsi plant in a garden inside the temple. He and his wife named the child as Kothai, who grew up as a devotee of Krishan, an avatar of Vishnu. She is believed to have worn the garland before dedicating it to the presiding deity of the temple. Periazhwar, who later found it, was highly upset and remonstrated her. Vishnu appeared in his dream and asked him to dedicate only the garland worn by Andal to him. The girl Kothai was thus named Andal and was referred as Chudikodutha Sudrakodi (lady who gave her garland to Vishnu). The practise is followed during modern times when the garland of Andal is sent to Azhagar Koyil on Garudostavam during the Tamil month of Puratasi (September – October) and Tirumala Venkateswara Temple during Chitra Pournami.It is also believed that Ranganatha of Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple married Andal, who later merged with the idol. Andal was taken in a palanquin from Srivilliputhur to Srirangam before the marriage. Since Andal married Ranganatha, who came as a king (called Raja), the presiding deity is called Rangamannar.

A hall in the garden is used for resting deities during the Vasantotsavam festival celebrated for six days in May–June every year.
The history of the temple is mentioned in the Brahmanda Purana, one of the eighteen famed Hindu scriptures. Per Hindu legend, Tulasi once did penance to attain closeness to Vishnu. Vishnu responded that his consort Lakshmi would appear under Tulasi’s lap in Tiruvinnagaram. Tulasi appeared in the place where the temple is located. This is mentioned in the 53rd verse of Nammazhwaar in Thiruviruththam. Markandeya Maharishi worshipped Vishnu and desired that Lakshmi should appear as his daughter and Vishnu should become his son-in-law. Once Markandeya was on a holy trip and after reaching Thiruvinnagaram, he felt it was the right place to get his desire fulfilled. Markandeya started a severe penance for thousand years, seeking Lakshmi’s blessings. Lakshmi appeared as a baby under the already incarnated tulasi plant. Markandeya felt Lakshmi’s presence in the form of the baby and realised that part of his desire had been fulfilled. He took possession of the baby and raised her. When the young girl reached adolescence, on the panguni month of Shravana, Vishnu appeared as an old man and asked for the hand of Markandeya’s daughter in marriage. Markandeya replied, “You are very ripe and old, my daughter is too young and she does not even know how to cook with proper salt contents”, to which the old man replied, “If your daughter must cook without salt, then I will still take it as my best food, but I will not leave from here without marrying her”. Markandeya sought Vishnu’s help and then realised using his penance that the old man was Vishnu himself. When he opened his eyes, Vishnu appeared in front of him with conch and chakram as in Vaikundam. Markandeya offered his daughter’s hand in marriage. Per the legend, the temple’s Neyvethiyam (food offering) is always prepared without salt.[1]
The name Oppiliappan is a result of this legend. There is also a story behind the tank in this temple. Once a King had consummated with a daughter of a saint and hence the saint cursed him to become a bird. The king lived as a bird and one night when there was a storm, the branch of the tree the bird was sleeping on broke and fell into the water of this tank. The bird regained its original form as the King and since then this is known as the only theerththam that one can do theerth thaadanam even in the night. Since this tank has such healing power in the day as well as night, it is called “Ahoraathra Pushkarani”.The place is called by various names, including “Agasa Nagaram”, “Vaikunda Nagaram”, “Thiruvinnagar”, “Oppiliappan Sannithi” and “Uppiliappan Sannithi”. The presiding deity is also called by various names, including Venkatachalapathy, Thiruvinnagarappan, Oppilaappan, Thanoppillaappan, Uppiliappan and Srinivasan.
It is not clear from the inscriptions and records when the temple was initiated, but there are inscriptions from the Medieval Cholas period indicating generous gifts to the temple. There are two inscriptions recorded from the Naganathar Temple in Tirunageswaram. The epigraph numbered 211 of 1911 on the northern wall of the central shrine indicates gift of gold jewel worked in gems and pearls to the temple from the Chola king Parakesarivarman, alias Rajendra Chola I (1012–44 CE). The second inscription numbered 218 of 1911 on the shrine’s southern wall indicates a gift of land to the temple in the 14th year of the Chola king Rajaraja Rajakkesarivarman I.
The tradition in many ancient temples in Tamil Nadu including this one is that the original image of the presiding deity is made of wood and replaced later with stone.[11] There were a lot of additions made to the temple by Govinda Dikshitar, the minister of successive Nayak rulers, Achuthappa Nayak (1560–1614) and Raghunatha Nayak (1600–34).[12] The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.

The Vriddhagiriswarar Temple is a Hindu temple in the town of Vriddhachalam, Cuddalore district. The presiding deity is Vriddhagiriswarar. The temple gives its name to the town of Vriddhachalam. Oldest Mountain: As per Hindu Mythology, when Brahma thought of creating the earth, he created water. Lord Vishnu happened to cut down the evil Madhukaidavas. The cut pieces of the bodies floated on water created by Lord Brahma. On seeing that Brahma prayed to Lord Shiva to create the earth out of the hardened compound from the water and the flesh of the bodies. Lord Shiva appeared as a mountain. Lord Brahma who did not know this created many different mountains. As they did not have space to exist, he was sorrowful. The Pranava God appeared and conveyed Lord Brahma the truth through gestures. Brahma worshipped Lord Shiva who was the form of mountain. Lord Shiva created the earth combining the flesh and the water compounded in a hardened form. He called it medhini. He gave space for the mountains of Brahma. He told Brahma that he was not different from the mountain. The mountains of Brahma came into being after that mountain. Hence the mountain of Shiva was named Pazha malai (old mountain). According to him, that Pazhamalai would be hard pressed on the earth appearing as Shiva Linga above. Those who worshipped it would get all they wished for. Thus, the oldest of all mountains is invisible, but the top layer of it is said to appear in the river-bed of Cuddalore at Vayalur, about four km north of Virudhachalam. Place for Salvation: It is the faith of the devotees that salvation is surety if he/she is born in the place, or live in the place, or pray the Lord here, or even thinking of him even while elsewhere and die in this place. One of the above five criteria will free him/her from the cycle of births and deaths. Virudhachalam unaffected by Pralaya: When the world was destroyed by pralaya floods, it is said that this holy place – Virudhachalam stood unaffected and fully alive. 1008 Shiva Shrines: Of the 1008 Shiva shrines of the country considered in high esteem, four lead this divine list of which Virudhachalam is one. Etymology: Vriddha means ancient – Achalam the hill. Virudhachalam means an ancient hill. In chaste Tamil this is mentioned as Mudhu Kundram in Thevaram hymns. During the days of Saivite Saints Appar, Gnanasambandhar and Sundarar, the place was known as Pazhamalai in Tamil and changed to the Sanskrit version Virudhachalam in the days that followed. Sage Vibasithu paid the labours with Vanni leaves: Sage Vibasithu had a dip in the Manimuthar river and undertook the renovation of this temple. He gave the workers the leaves of the Vanni tree which later changed into coins to the value due to the workers based on the quantum and quality of his work, is a story believed by generations of devotees. The Vanni tree is 1700-year-old, say researchers. Mattru Uraitha Vinayaka: Saint Sundarar was on a fund-raising mission to feed the devotees on the Panguni Uthiram festival in Tiruvarur. Sundarar passed through this place without singing the glory of the Lord. He was stopped by the Lord and made him sing. Then, Lord of this temple donated 12,000 gold coins to Sundararar. Beware of robbers on the way, he placed all the coins in the Manimuthar River and collected it in the tank in Tiruvarur. This is a strange precaution. Money placed in a river cannot be collected from a tank that has no link with each other. But this miracle happened. Thus, came the proverb, “losing in the river and searching in the tank”. Sundarar wanted to test the touch of the gold he took from the tank in Tiruvarur. Lord proved the quality of the gold with Lord Vinayaka as a witness who confirmed the touch. Hence, Vinayaka in the inner prakara of the temple is praised as Mattru-touch, Uraitha-confirmed, Vinayaka- Mattru Uraitha Vinayaka. Significance of Number Five here: Number five has a significance in this temple. Murthis are five – Lords Vinayaka, Muruga, Shiva, Shakthi and Chandikeswara. Lord is praised by five names – Virudhagireeshwarar, Pazhamalai Nathar, Vruddhachaleswarar, Mudhu Kundreeswarar and Vruddhagiri. There are five Vinayakas in the temple – Aazhathu Vinayakar, Mattru Uraitha Vinayaka, Muppillayar, Dasabhuja Ganapathy and Vallabha Ganapathi. Five Rishis had the darshan of Lord – Romesa, Vibasiddhu, Kumaradeva, Nada Sharma and Anavardhini. There five towers in the temple at east, west, south, north and Kandarathithan (a Chola king) gopuram. There are five prakaras – called Thiruchutru in Tamil They are Kailaya, Vanniyadi, 63 Nayanmar Chuttru and Panchavarna Chuttru. There are five Kodimarams – flag post with five Nandhis – Indra Nandhi, Vedha Nandhi, Athma Nandhi, Maalvidai Nandhi and Dharma Nandhi. There are five inner Mandaps – Artha, Idaikazhi, Thapana, Maha and Isai Mandapams. Outer Mandapams are 20 pillar mandapam, Deeparadhana, 100 pillar mandapam, Vipachithu and Chitra mandapam. Five-time puja is followed in the temple – Thiruvanandal, Kalasanthi, Uchi Kala, Sayaraksha and Arthajama at scheduled times from early morning till night. The temple has five cars-Raths for Lords Vinayaka, Muruga, Pazhamalai Nathar, Mother Periyanayagi and Sri Chandikeswara. The place has five names – Tirumudhu Kundram, Vruddha Kasi, Virudhachalam, Nerkuppai and Mudhugiri. Virutha Kasi: It is one of the places giving salvation to the departed. It is even considered holier than Holy Kasi i.e. Varanasi. As believed in Kasi, here too Mother Viruthambigai places the departed souls on her lap and fan them with the pallu of her Sari while Lord Shiva chants the Namasivaya mantra in the ears of the dead ensuring his/her salvation. Hence in olden days people of Virudhachalam never bothered to undertake a pilgrimage to Varanasi when they become old and weak. As a result, this place is also come to known as Virudhakasi. It is also claimed that the benefit measure is a little bit more here than Kasi, hence the saying “Kasiyil Veesam Adhigam in Virudhakasi”. Ashes of the dead turning into Stone: The ashes of the dead when dissolved in Manimuthar River change into a stone and stay underneath, according to Sthalapuranam. Mother Peria Nayaki fed King of Karnataka: During his visit to this place, the king of Karnataka suffered due to hunger. Mother Peria Nayaki, as a young woman fed him with milk and named him Kumara Deva. Lord Shiva danced for his own joy here: Lord Shiva as Nataraja danced in Thillai for a contest. He played here for his own joy. Mother appeared to Guru Namshivayar as old woman and young woman: Viruthambigai means Goddess of elderly age. Devotee Guru Namshivayar stayed in this place for a night on his way to Chidambaram. He was very hungry and called Mother with a verse with a word Kizhathi. Mother Periyanayagi came there as an old woman and replied that Kizhavi-old woman cannot bring food, only young woman can. The devotee sang another verse describing the youthfulness of Ambica. She appeared as a young beautiful woman and fed the devotee and thus came to be known as Balambika – young Mother. Maasi Magam: Maasi Magam is an important festival. It is believed that Vibasithu Munivar sought the darshan of Lord Siva, through the Nandi. On the sixth day of the Masi Magam festival, Lord Vriddhagiriswarar, along with his Consort Goddess Viruthambigai, appeared before Vibasithu Munivar. Story behind the construction of the temple: The construction of the temple, by itself, has an interesting legend. Vibasithu Munivar, it is said, happened to find the earring that belonged to Lord Kubera’s daughter. The jewel, dear to her, was dropped on the lap of Vibhasithu, by a bird. Kubera’s daughter announced a reward of all her remaining Jewellery in return for her earring. Vibhasithu gave the earring and with the reward he constructed the temple.

The two main shrines of the temple are for vanmikinathar (Lord Siva) and Thyagarajar. Of the two, the former is the most ancient, and derives its name from tha anthill(putru), which takes the place of linga in the main shrine. Appar, the 7th-century poet saint, refers to the main deity in his hymn as puttritrukondan(one who resides in the ant hill). The Stala vriksham(temple tree) is patiri(trumpet flower tree). The principles and practises of tree-worship and ophilotary are ancient bases whereupon a later date linga worship seems to have been established.

The festival images of Chandrasekarar and Sekari Amman arrive at this hall during the Thiruvadhirai festival. Thulapara hall is named after the legend in which king Mucundaka placed Thyagaraja image of Thiruvarur in one and all others in another plate he received from Indra (the king of celestial deities). Purana hall is located in the northern part of the temple. Rajanarayana hall is a public hall for localities of Thiruvaru.

The temple is believed to have been initiated with a large complex by the Pallavas during the 7th century. Contemporary history of the temple dates back to the time of the Medieval Cholas. An inscription dated in the 20th regnal year of Rajendra I(1012–1044) beginning with introduction “Tirumanni valara” is found on the north and west walls of the Thyagaraja shrine.It gives a list of gifts including a number of jewels and lamps to the god veedhividankar(Thyagarajar).It records that the temple was built in stone in the regnal years of the king by Anukkiyar Paravai Nangaiyar.Besides the same lady liberally endowed gold for plating and gilding parts of the vimana,the entrance and the four sides of the shrine.Copper was also donated for plating the doors, corbels of the pillars of the mandapa in front of the shrine.This inscription meticulously records the weight of the endowed gold and copper,besides listing the various ornaments gifted to the temple with description each of them.
The temple complex seems to have acted as the cultural model for the big Brahadeeswarar temple at Thanjavur of Rajaraja Chola I, wherein he enshrined a vitankar which shared with the Adavallan of Chidambaram the status of state cult. The last Chola monarch to play an important role in the affairs of the temple was Kulothunga Chola III in the early part of the 13th century A.D. It attracted saivas of all schools and was important centre of Golaki matha in the 13th and 14th century. It was also an important Jaina dwelling place, which was attacked by saivas, as is evident from Periya Puranam, account of life of tantiyadigal.

Puducherry or Pondicherry was originally called Podouke(This was mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea.). This old port town Podouke( Now it is called Arikamedu) is 4 km from the present Puducherry. As per investigation by Vimala Begley, this port city Podouke was at the peak between from the 2nd century BCE to the 8th century CE. This port city enjoyed extensive trade relations with Imperial Rome. François Martin the first Governor General of French India founded the modern Pondicherry, the future capital of French India in 1674. The Varadaraja temple housed the images of the Vedapureeswarar Temple during the destruction by the French troops during 1748.It is believed that the temple was totally destructed by the invading French troops and earlier by Muslim invaders. Dewan Kandappa Mudaliar, with the help of public contributions, reconstructed the temple in 1788. The details of the demolition has been recorded in the diary of a chronicler of a period named Ananda Rangam Pillai. The presiding deity in the temple is believed to have been migrated from the Samba Easwaran street to the temple during the later part of the 19th century.[2]The temple is maintained and administered by Sri Vedapureeswarar Sri Varadaraja Perumal Devastanam under the Department of Hindu religious institutions and Wakf of the Government of Puducherry

Nataraja Temple, also referred to as the Chidambaram Nataraja temple or Thillai Nataraja temple  is a Hindu temple dedicated to Nataraja – Shiva as the lord of dance – in Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu, India.The temple has mythical roots and a Shiva shrine existed at the site when the town was known as Thillai.Chidambaram, the name of the city and the temple literally means “atmosphere of wisdom” or “clothed in thought”, the temple architecture symbolizes the connection between the arts and spirituality, creative activity and the divine.The temple wall carvings display all the 108 karanas from the Natya Shastra by Bharata Muni, and these postures form a foundation of Bharatanatyam, a classical Indian dance.
The present temple was built in the 10th century when Chidambaram was the capital of the Chola dynasty, making it one of the oldest surviving active temple complexes in South India. After its 10th century consecration by the Cholas who considered Nataraja as their family deity, the temple has been damaged, repaired, renovated and expanded through the 2nd millennium. Most of the temple’s surviving plan, architecture and structure is from the late 12th and early 13th centuries, with later additions in similar style. While Shiva as Nataraja is the primary deity of the temple, it reverentially presents major themes from Shaktism, Vaishnavism, and other traditions of Hinduism. The Chidambaram temple complex, for example, has the earliest known Amman or Devi temple in South India, a pre-13th century Surya shrine with chariot, shrines for Ganesha, Murugan and Vishnu, one of the earliest known Shiva Ganga sacred pool, large mandapas for the convenience of pilgrims (choultry, ambalam or sabhai) and other monuments.Shiva himself is presented as the Nataraja performing the Ananda Tandava (“Dance of Delight”) in the golden hall of the shrine Pon Ambalam .
The temple is one of the five elemental lingas in the Shaivism pilgrimage tradition, and considered the subtlest of all Shiva temples (Kovil) in Hinduism. It is also a site for performance arts, including the annual Natyanjali dance festival on Maha Shivaratri.
The Nataraja temple has ancient roots, likely following the temple architecture tradition that is found all over South India from at least the 5th century. Textual evidence, such as those of the Sangam tradition, suggest a temple existed here along with Madurai in ancient times,but the town is not named Chidambaram in these pre-5th century texts.The earliest mention of “dancing god of Chidambaram” as Shiva is found in 6th and early 7th century texts by Appar and Sambadar.The Suta Samhita embedded inside Skanda Purana and variously dated between 7th and 10th century mentions the Chiadambaram dance. The surviving Nataraja temple has a structure that is traceable to the early Chola dynasty. Chidambaram was the early capital of this dynasty, and Shiva Nataraja was their family deity. The Chidambaram temple town remained important to the Cholas, albeit with increasing competition from other temple towns when Rajaraja Chola I moved the capital to Thanjavur, built a new city and the massive Brihadeeswarar Temple dedicated to Shiva in early 11th-century, which is now a world heritage site.
Nataraja Shiva and his “dance of bliss” is an ancient Hindu art concept. It is found in various texts such as Tatva Nidhi which describes seven types of dance and their spiritual symbolism, Kashyapa Silpa which describes 18 dance forms with iconographic details and design instructions, as well as Bharata’s ancient treatise on performance arts Natya Shastra which describes 108 dance postures among other things. Reliefs and sculptures of Nataraja have been found across the Indian subcontinent, some dating to 6th-century and earlier such as in Aihole and Badami cave temples.
The Chidambaram temple built on this heritage, yet creatively evolved the idea into forms not found elsewhere. The earliest historically verifiable Shiva temple at Chidambaram is traceable in inscriptions that date to the rule of Aditya Chola I in the early 10th century, and far more during the rule of the 10th century Chola king Parantaka For them, the dancing Shiva was the kula-nayaka (family guide or deity) and Chidambaram was the capital they built.These inscriptions and texts from this period suggest that the significance of the Agama texts and Shaiva Bhakti movement was strengthening within the Chola leadership and thought.
The copper plate inscriptions of Parantaka I (c. 907-955 CE) describe him as the “bee at the lotus feet of Shiva” who built the golden house for Shiva, with Chit-sabha, Hema-sabha, Hiranya-sabha and Kanaka-sabha (all mandapam, pillared pilgrim rest places). He is referred to as “Pon veinda Perumal”, which means “one who covered with gold” the Chit-sabha of Chidambaram. Both Aditya I and his Chola successor Parantaka I were active supporters of arts and temple building. They converted many older brick and wooden temples into more lasting temples from cut stone as the building blocks in dozens of places across South India.
Raja Raja Chola I (985-1013 CE) embarked on a mission to recover the hymns of the 63 Nayanmars after hearing short excerpts of the Tevaram in his court. He sought the help of Nambiyandar Nambi, who was a priest in a temple.It is believed that by divine intervention Nambi found the presence of scripts, in the form of cadijam leaves half eaten by white ants in a chamber inside the second precinct in Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram.The brahmanas (Dikshitars) in the temple are supposed to have disagreed with the king by saying that the works were too divine,and that only by the arrival of the “Naalvar”(The four saints)-Appar,Sundar,Thirugnanasambandar and Appar would they allow for the chambers to be opened.Rajaraja,however,created idols of them and prepared for them to be brought to the temple through a procession. but Rajaraja is said to have prevailed. Rajaraja thus became to be known as Tirumurai Kanda Cholan meaning one who saved the Tirumurai.
In another version of the story,Rajaraja is said to have experienced a dream from lord Shiva telling Rajaraja that the hymns in Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram are in a state of destruction and to recover the remaining hymns from the chambers.The brahmanas (Dikshitars) in the temple,however,are supposed to have disagreed with the king by saying that the works were too divine to be accessed,and that only by the arrival of the 63 Nayanmars would they allow for the chambers to be opened.Rajaraja,devising a plan,consecrated idols of each of them and prepared for them to be brought into the temple through a procession.It is said that the 63 idols are still present in the Thillai Nataraja Temple.When the vault was opened,Rajaraja is said to have found the room infested with white ants,and that the hymns were salvaged as much as possible.
The temple, according to inscriptions found in South India and Southeast Asia, was also historic recipient of a precious jewel from the king of Angkor who built the Angkor Wat through Chola king Kulothunga, who submitted it to the temple in 1114 CE. Kulothunga I and his son expanded the Chidambaram Nataraja temple expanse sixfold.
Chidambaram temple thrived during the Chola dynasty rule through mid 13th century, along with the later Shiva-based Thanjavur and Gangaikondacholapuram capitals, as well as Vishnu-based Srirangam temple towns. Its facilities infrastructure was expanded. Naralokaviran, the general of king Kulothunga Chola I was responsible for building the steps that lead to Sivaganga water pool, a goddess shrine, a shrine for child saint Thirugnana Sambanthar, temple gardens and a pilgrim road network in and around Chidambaram. He constructed a hall for recitation of Tevaram hymns and engraved the hymns in copper plates.The thousand pillar choultry, with friezes narrating Hindu texts, was built in late 12th-century.Between the second half of the 12th century and the early 13th century, the Chola kings added colorful and high gopura stone gateways as easily identifiable landmarks, starting with the western gopura. Thereafter, about mid 13th century, the Pandya dynasty ended the Chola dynasty.The Hindu Pandyas were liberal supporters of Chidambaram temple, along with other Shiva and Vishnu temples, just like the Chola. Sundara Pandya added the huge eastern gopura at Chidambaram, beginning the colossal gateway tradition.Most of the structure and plans currently seen in the Chidambaram complex, including the mandapas with their pillar carvings, the various shrines with polished granite sculptures, the sacred water pool and the early gopurams are from the 12th and 13th century, attributed to the late Chola and early Pandya kings.
The Nataraja temple in Chidambaram is located in the southeastern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is about 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) north of the Kollidam River (Kaveri), 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) west from the coast of Bay of Bengal, and 220 kilometres (140 mi) south of Chennai. The closest major airport is about 60 kilometres (37 mi) north in Pondicherry (IATA: PNY). The National Highway 32 (old numbering: NH-45A) passes through Chidambaram. The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation and private companies operate services connecting it to major cities in the state.[21] The site is linked to the Indian Railways with daily express trains to South Indian cities.[22]
Chidambaram is a temple town, with the Nataraja complex spread over 40 acres (0.16 km2) within a nearly square courtyard in the center. Its side roads are aligned to the east-west, north-south axis. It has double walls around its periphery with gardens. It has had entrance gateways on all four sides.

https://www.bharattemples.com/arunachalesvara-temple-tiruvannamalai-tamil-nadu/,"Arunachalesvara Temple, Tiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu
Arunachalesvara Temple, also called Annamalaiyar Temple, is a Hindu temple dedicated to the deity Shiva, located at the base of Arunachala hill in the town of Thiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu, India. It is significant to the Hindu sect of Saivism as one of the temples associated with the five elements, the Pancha Bhoota Stalas, and specifically the element of fire, or Agni. Shiva is worshiped as Arunachalesvara or Annamalaiyar, and is represented by the lingam, with his idol referred to as Agni lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Unnamalai Amman.The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The 9th century Saiva saint poet Manikkavasagar composed the Tiruvempaavai here.
The temple complex covers 10 hectares, and is one of the largest in India.[3] It houses four gateway towers known as gopurams. The tallest is the eastern tower, with 11 stories and a height of 66 metres (217 ft), making it one of the tallest temple towers in India.[3] The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Arunachalesvara and Unnamalai Amman being the most prominent. The temple complex houses many halls; the most notable is the thousand-pillared hall built during the Vijayanagar period.
The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 5:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., and twelve yearly festivals on its calendar. The Karthigai Deepam festival is celebrated during the day of the full moon between November and December, and a huge beacon is lit atop the hill. It can be seen from miles around, and symbolizes the Shiva lingam of fire joining the sky.The event is witnessed by three million pilgrims. On the day preceding each full moon, pilgrims circumnavigate the temple base and the Arunachala hills in a worship called Girivalam, a practice carried out by one million pilgrims yearly.
The present masonry structure was built during the Chola dynasty in the 9th century, while later expansions are attributed to Vijayanagar rulers of the Sangama Dynasty (1336–1485 CE), the Saluva Dynasty and the Tuluva Dynasty (1491–1570 CE). The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu.
The temple is situated at the bottom of the Arunachala hills, and faces east, lying over 25 acres. The walls on the east and west measure 700 ft (210 m), the south 1,479 ft (451 m), and the north 1,590 ft (480 m). It has four gateway towers, the gopuram, on its four sides. The eastern tower, the Rajagopuram, is the tallest in the temple. The base of the Rajagopuram is made of granite, measuring 135 ft (41 m) by 98 ft (30 m).It was begun by king Krishnadevaraya (1509–29 CE) of the Vijayanagara dynasty, and completed by Sevappa Nayaka (1532–80 CE). The inscriptions indicate that the tower was built at the behest of Sivanesa and his brother Lokanatha in 1572 CE.The south tower is called Thirumanjangopuram, and the west, Pei Gopuram. Ammani Amman gourami in the north.Raghunathabhyudayam and Sangitha Sudha, both Nayak scriptures, also describe the towers. The Tanjavuri Andhra Raja Charitamu mentions that Krishnadevaraya built the tower and the outer precincts of the temple.The temple has a total of five precincts, each of which holds a huge Nandi, the sacred bull of Shiva. Towers include the Vallala Maharaja Gopuram and Kili Gopuram, or Parrot Tower.
The main shrine of Arunachalesvara faces east, housing images of Nandi and Surya, and is the oldest structure in the temple. Behind the walls of the sanctum, there is an image of Venugopalaswamy, an incarnation of Vishnu. Around the sanctum, there are images of Somaskandar, Durga, Chandekeswarar, Gajalakshmi, Arumugaswami, Dakshinamoorthy, Swarnabairavar, Nataraja, and Lingodbhavar—the last an image of Shiva emanating from lingam. The Palliyarai, the divine room for resting deities, is located at the first precinct around the sanctum. The shrine of his consort, Unnamulai Amman, lies in the second precinct, with Amman depicted in a standing posture. Sambantha Vinayagar, the elephant god shrine, is located to the north of the flagstaff and the Bali peeta, or platform for sacrifice.To the south of the thousand-pillared hall, there is a small shrine for Subramaya and a large tank. Pathala Lingam, the underground lingam, is the place where Ramana Maharshi (1879 – 1950 CE) is believed to have performed his penance.The shrine of Sivagangai Vinayagar is present in the northern bank of the Sivanganga tank.
There is a sixteen pillared Deepa Darshana Mandapam, or hall of light, in the third precinct. The temple tree, Magizha, is considered sacred and medicinal, and childless couples tie small cradles to its branches in obeisance. Vedas write that the mast of the temple separated the earth and the sky during creation of the universe.The Kalyana Mandapam, the marriage hall, is in the south-west of the precinct, and is built in Vijayanagara style. A stone trident is present in the outer shrine of the temple in open air, and has protective railings like a sacred tree. The Vasantha Mandapam, meaning the Hall of spring, is the third precinct, and contains the temple office and Kalahateeswarar shrine.The fourth precinct has an image of Nandi, Brahma Theertham, the temple tank, the Yanai Thirai Konda Vinayaga shrine, and a hall with a six-foot-tall statue of Nandi, erected by Vallala Maharaja.
Inside the doorway of the first tower and the fifth precinct, there is a thousand-pillared hall built during the late Vijayanagara period.Krishnadevaraya constructed the hall and dug the tank opposite to it. The pillars in the hall are carved with images of yali, a mythological beast with body of lion and head of an elephant, a symbol of Nayak power.The Arunagirinathar Mandapam is located to the right of the Kalayana Linga Sundara Eswara Mandapam, and the Gopurathilayanar shrine is to the left of a broad flight of stone stairs that lead up to the Vallala Gopuram.
The present masonry and towers date back to the 9th century CE, as seen from an inscription in the structure made by Chola kings who ruled at that time. Further inscriptions indicate that before the 9th century, Tiruvannamalai was under the Pallava Kings, who ruled from Kanchipuram.[13] The 7th century Nayanar saints Sambandar and Appar wrote of the temple in their poetic work, Tevaram. Sekkizhar, the author of the Periyapuranam wrote that both Appar and Sambandar worshiped Arunachalesvara in the temple.The Chola Kings ruled over the region for more than four centuries, from 850 CE to 1280 CE, and were temple patrons. The inscriptions from the Chola king record various gifts like land, sheep, cow and oil to the temple commemorating various victories of the dynasty.The Hoysala kings used Tiruvannamalai as their capital beginning in 1328 CE.There are 48 inscriptions from the Sangama Dynasty (1336–1485 CE), 2 inscriptions from Saluva Dynasty, and 55 inscriptions from Tuluva Dynasty (1491–1570 CE) of the Vijayanagara Empire, reflecting gifts to the temple from their rulers. There are also inscriptions from the rule of Krishnadeva Raya (1509–1529 CE), the most powerful Vijayanagara king, indicating further patronage.Most of the Vijayanagara inscriptions were written in Tamil, with some in Kannada and Sanskrit.The inscriptions in temple from the Vijayanagara kings indicate emphasis on administrative matters and local concerns, which contrasts the inscriptions of the same rulers in other temples like Tirupathi. The majority of the gift related inscriptions are for land endownments, followed by goods, cash endowments, cows and oil for lighting lamps.The town of Tiruvannamalai was at a strategic crossroads during the Vijayanagara Empire, connecting sacred centers of pilgrimage and military routes.There are inscriptions that show the area as an urban center before the precolonial period, with the city developing around the temple, similar to the Nayak ruled cities like Madurai.
During the 17th century CE, the temple along with the Tiruvannamalai town came under the dominion of the Nawab of the Carnatic. As the Mughal empire came to an end, the Nawab lost control of the town, with confusion and chaos ensuing after 1753.Subsequently, there were periods of both Hindu and Muslim stewardship of the temple, with Muraru Raya, Krishna Raya, Mrithis Ali Khan, and Burkat Ullakhan besieging the temple in succession. As European incursions progressed, Tiruvannamalai was attacked by French Soupries, Sambrinet, and the English Captain Stephen Smith. While some were repelled, others were victorious. The French occupied the town in 1757, and the temple along with the town came under control of the British in 1760. In 1790 CE, Tiruvannamalai town was captured by Tippu Sultan, who ruled from 1750–99 CE.During the first half of the 19th century, the town along with the temple came under British rule.From 1951, under the provision of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, the temple has been maintained by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board (HR &CE) of the Government of Tamil Nadu. In 2002, the Archaeological Survey of India declared the temple a national heritage monument and took over its stewardship. Widespread protests and litigation with the Supreme Court of India, however, led the Archaeological Survey to cede the temple back to the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board.
In Hindu mythology, Parvati, wife of Shiva, once closed the eyes of her husband playfully in a flower garden at their abode atop Mount Kailash. Although only a moment for the gods, all light was taken from the universe, and the earth, in turn, was submerged in darkness for years. Parvati performed penance along with other devotees of Shiva.Then her husband appeared as a column of fire at the top of Arunachala hills, returning light to the world. He then merged with Parvati to form Ardhanarishvara, the half-female, half-male form of Shiva.The Arunachala, or red mountain, lies behind the Arunachalesvara temple, and is associated with the temple of its namesake. The hill is sacred and considered a lingam, or iconic representation of Shiva, in itself.
Another legend is that once, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva appeared as a flame, and challenged them to find his source.Brahma took the form of a swan, and flew to the sky to see the top of the flame, while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base. The scene is called lingothbava, and is represented in the western wall at the sanctum of most Shiva temples. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship.

https://www.bharattemples.com/jambukeswarar-temple-tiruchirappalli-tamil-nadu/,"Jambukeswarar Temple, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu
Jambukeswarar Temple, Thiruvanaikaval(also Thiruvanaikal, Jambukeswaram) is a famous Shiva temple in Tiruchirapalli(Trichy), in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. The temple was built by Kocengannan (Kochenga Chola), one of the Early Cholas, around 1,800 years ago. It is located in the Srirangam island, which has the famous Ranganathaswamy temple.
Thiruvanaikal is one of the five major Shiva Temples of Tamil Nadu (Panchabhoota Sthalams) representing the Mahābhūta or five great elements; this temple represents the element of water, or neer in Tamil.The sanctum of Jambukeswara has an underground water stream and in spite of pumping water out, it is always filled with water.
It is one of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams, where all the four most revered Nayanars (Saivite Saints) have sung glories of the deity in this temple. The temple has inscriptions from the Chola period.
As per Fergusson, the temple surpasses the Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple in architectural terms, which were both constructed at the same time. There are five enclosures inside the temple. The massive outer wall covering the fifth precinct, known as the Vibudi Prakara, stretches over a mile and is two feet thick and over 25 feet high. Legend maintains that the wall was built by Shiva working with the laborers.The fourth precinct contains a hall with 796 pillars and measures 2436 feet by 1493. It also has a small tank fed by perpetual springs.The third enclosure is 745 feet by 197 surrounded a wall 30 feet high. This area has two gopurams (gateway towers) 73 and 100 feet tall, a coconut thoppu and a small water tank.The second enclosure is 306 feet by 197, a gopuram 65 feet high and several small shrines.The inner most enclosure measuring 126 feet by 123 has the sanctum.The sanctum sanctorum is a square structure, found independently situated at the center of the innermost enclosure. There is a vimana on the roof of the sanctum. The structure is open on three sides, with a shallow moat separating it from the circumambulatory path of the innermost enclosure. The sthala-vriksham, or holy tree here is the White Jambuka, Syzygium samarangense, found growing along the south-eastern wall of the sanctum sanctorum. The trunk of the tree is protected by a walled structure. The western side of the sanctum, from where the deity is viewed, is continuous with a large closed hall, the Mukha Mantapa, containing four-pillars and housing a bronze idol of Nandi. The Mukha Mantapa has a large, ornate western door gilded with silver that forms the principal entrance. There are two additional entrances to the Mukha Mantapa on the southern and North Eastern sides as well. A set of three steps descend to the level of the sanctum sanctorum from the Mukha Mantapa. The deity is viewed through a stone window that forms an integral part of the western face of the sanctum sanctorum. The window has nine viewing apertures, believed to represent the Navagraha. There is a panel in bas-relief over the window depicting the sthala puranam: The jambuka tree growing out of a meditating sage’s head on the extreme right; the linga of Jambukeswarar under the tree; a spider and an elephant worshiping the linga along with the Goddess Parvati who stands to the left of the linga. The sanctum sanctorum is divided into the Ardha Mantapam or Antaralam (whose western wall bears the window) and the Garbha Griha where the deity of Jambukeswarar is housed. Entrance into the Sanctum is through a small door on the southern wall, about 4 feet in height. The Ardha Mantapa is about 4 feet X 4 feet and contains an idol of Goddess Parvati on the right side of the door to the Garbha Griha. Devotees are admitted in groups of six into the Ardha Mantapa during sevas like Abhishekam or on payment of a small fee. The Garbha Griha is a wider structure compared to the Ardha Mantapa. At the center, the Brahma Sthana, is the self-manifested linga of Jambukeswarar. The upper conical part of the linga is of the color of copper, whereas the yoni-bhaga or the pedestal is of black granite. A brass ring is seen at the point of attachment of the linga to the pedestal. The height of the linga is about 3 feet from the floor of the sanctum. The Garbha Griha and the Ardha Mantapa are unadorned from the inside, the only source of illumination within the sanctum being ghee lamps. A stream of water is said to emerge from the linga, which is usually demonstrated as the soaking wet clothes in which it is draped. The water flow increases significantly during the Monsoon. The main deity of the temple is Jambukeswara, representing the element water. Jambukeswara is depicted sitting under a jambu tree, which grows over a small stream that engulfs the deity during the rainy season. The temple is also considered the abode of goddess Akilandeswari, one of the forms of the goddess Parvati. The greatest of works related to this temple include Tiruvanaikaval and Kilvelur Akshyalingaswamy temple.
Once Parvati mocked Shiva’s penance for betterment of the world. Shiva wanted to condemn her act and directed her to go to the earth from Kailasam (Shiva’s abode) to do penance. Parvathi in the form of Akilandeswari as per Shiva’s wish found Jambu forest (Thiruvanaikoil) to conduct her penance. She made a lingam out of water of river Cauvery (also called as river Ponni) under the Venn Naaval tree (the Venn Naaval tree on top of the saint Jambu) and commenced her worship. The lingam is known as Appu Lingam (Water Lingam).Siva at last gave darshan to Akilandeswari and taught her Siva Gnana. Akilandeswari took Upadesa (lessons) facing East from Shiva, who stood facing west.
There were two Siva Ganas ‘Malyavan’ and ‘Pushpadanta’. Though they are Siva Ganas they always quarrel with each other and fight for one thing or other. In one fight ‘Malyavan’ cursed ‘Pushpadanta’ to become an elephant on earth and the latter cursed the former to become a spider on earth. The elephant and the spider came to Jambukeswaram and continued their Siva worship. The elephant collected water from river Cauvery and conducted ablution to the lingam under the Jambu tree (Eugenia jambolana, the rose-apple tree) daily.[4] The spider constructed his web over the lingam to prevent dry leaves from dropping on it and prevent sunlight directly falling on it. When the elephant saw the web and thought it was dust on lingam. The elephant tore them and cleaned the lingam by pouring water and the practice continued daily. The spider became angry one day and crawled into the trunk of the elephant and bit the elephant to death, killing itself. Siva, in the form of Jambukeswara, moved by the deep devotion of the two, relieved them from the curse. As an elephant worshipped Siva here, this place came to be known as Thiru Aanai Kaa (thiru means holy, aanai is elephant, kaa (kaadu) means forest). Later the name ‘Thiruaanaikaa’ become ‘Thiruvanaikaval’ and ‘Thiruvanaikoil’.
As an outcome of making sin by killing the elephant, in the next birth, the spider was born as the King Kochengot Chola (kotchengannan cholan meaning red-eyed king) and built 70 temples and this temple is the one among them.Remembering his enmity with the elephant in his previous birth, he built the Siva Sannathi (sanctorum) such that not even a small elephant can enter. The entrance on the sanctorum of Jambukeswara is only 4 foot high and 2.5 foot wide.
There was a story behind the king’s red eyes – When he was in his mother’s womb the palace astrologer predicted a sacred time to give birth to enable the newborn’s well being. The queen went into labor early, before the time predicted by the astrologer. The queen hence told the servant to hang her upside down for the time to come so that she could have a wise and virtuous son who could head the kingdom righteously. This waiting time inside the womb made the baby’s eyes red. After becoming the king, he built the temple for Siva and Goddess Akilandeswari in the name of Aanaikka (elephant protected) later days it changed to Thiruvanaikovil.

Ramanathaswamy Temple  is a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Shiva located on Rameswaram island in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. It is also one of the twelve Jyotirlinga temples. It is one of the 274 Paadal Petra Sthalams, where the three of the most revered Nayanars (Saivite saints), Appar, Sundarar and Tirugnana Sambandar, have glorified the temple with their songs. The temple was expanded during the 12th century by Pandya Dynasty, and its principal shrines sanctum were renovated by Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan and his successor Gunaveera Cinkaiariyan of the Jaffna kingdom. The temple has the longest corridor among all Hindu temples in India.The temple is located in Rameswaram considered a holy pilgrimage site for Shaivites, Vaishnavites and Smarthas. The presiding deity, the Lingam of Ramanathaswamy (Shiva), is believed to have been established and worshiped by Rama, an avatar of the god Vishnu, to absolve the sins created during the Ramayana war at Sri Lanka.
The primary deity of the temple is Ramanathaswamy (Shiva) in the form of lingam.There are two lingams inside the sanctum – one built by Sita, from sand, residing as the main deity, Ramalingam and the one brought by Hanuman from Kailash called Vishwalingam.Rama instructed that the Vishwalingam should be worshipped first since it was brought by Hanuman – the tradition continues even today.
Like all ancient temples in South India, there is a high compound wall (madil) on all four sides of the temple premises measuring about 865 feet furlong from east to west and one furlong of 657 feet from north to south with huge towers (Gopurams) to the east and the west and finished gate towers to the north and south. The temple has striking long corridors in its interior, running between huge colonnades on platforms above five feet high.
The second corridor is formed by sandstone pillars, beams and ceiling. The junction of the third corridor on the west and the paved way leading from the western gopuram to the Setumadhava shrine forms a unique structure in the form of a chess board, popularly known as Chokkattan Madapam, where the Utsava deities are adorned and kept during the Vasanthotsavam (Spring festival) and on the 6th day festival in Adi (July–August) and Masi (February–March) conducted by the Setupati of Ramnad.
The outer set of corridors is reputed to be the longest in the world, measuring about 6.9 m in height, 400 feet each in the east and west and about 640 feet in the north and the south. The inner corridors are about 224 feet each in the east and the west and about 352 feet each in the north and the south.Their width varies from 15.5 feet to 17 feet in the east and west about 172 feet on the north and south with width varying 14.5 feet to 17 feet.The total length of these corridors is thus 3850 feet. There are about 1212 pillars in the outer corridor.Their height is about 30 feet from the floor to the center of the roof. The main tower or rajagopuram is 53 m tall. Most pillars are carved with individual compositions.At the beginning, Ramanathaswamy Temple was a thatched shed. The present structure was the work of many individuals spread over a number of centuries. The pride of place in the establishment for the Temple goes to the Setupatis of Ramanathapuram. In the seventeenth century, Dalavai Setupati built a portion of the main eastern Gopuram. In late eighteenth century, the world-famous third corridor was constructed by Muthuramalinga Setupati who lived for forty nine years and ruled between 1763 and 1795. The corridor was called “Chokkatan Mandapam”. The Mukhya Pradhani (Chief Minister) was Muthuirullappa Pillai and the Chinna Pradhani (Deputy Chief Minister) was Krishna Iyengar. The Setupati’s statue and those of his two Pradhanis (ministers) can be seen at the western entrance to the third corridor.
The composite columns of Virabhadra holding sword and horn are found be additions of the Vijayanayagara kings during the early 1500s. Similar columns of Virabhadra are found in Adikesava Perumal Temple at Thiruvattaru, Meenakshi Temple at Madurai, Nellaiappar Temple at Tirunelveli, Kasi Viswanathar temple at Tenkasi, Krishnapuram Venkatachalapathy temple, Soundararajaperumal temple at Thadikombu, Srivilliputhur Andal temple, Srivaikuntanathan Permual temple at Srivaikuntam, Avudayarkovil, Vaishnava Nambi and Thirukurungudivalli Nachiar temple at Thirukkurungudi.
There are separate shrines for Ramanathaswamy and his consort goddess Parvathavardhini separated by a corridor.There are separate shrines for the goddess Vishalakshi, the utsava images, sayanagriha, Vishnu and Ganesha. There are various halls inside the temple, namely Anuppu Mandapam, Sukravara Mandapam, Setupati Mandapam, Kalyana Mandapam and Nandi Mandapam.
According to the Ramayana, Rama, the seventh avatar of the god Vishnu, prayed to the god Shiva to absolve him of the sin committed during his war against the demon king Ravana in Sri Lanka.Rama wanted to have a large lingam to worship Shiva. He directed Hanuman, the lieutenant in his army, to bring a lingam from the Himalayas. When Hanuman was delayed in bringing the lingam, Sita, the wife of Rama, built a small lingam out of the sand available in the sea shore, which is believed to be the lingam in the sanctum.

The form of Shiva’s consort Parvati worshipped at this temple is called Karpagambal is from Tamil (“Goddess of the Wish-Yielding Tree”). The temple is the most ancient one that has been built around the 7th century CE in Dravidian architecture.

His consort Parvati is depicted as Karpagambal. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam.
The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Kapaleeswarar and Karpagambal being the most prominent. The temple complex houses many halls. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 5:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., and four yearly festivals on its calendar. The Arubathimooval festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Panguni is the most prominent festival in the temple.
The present masonry structure was built during the Vijayanagar rulers of the Tuluva Dynasty (1491–1570 CE). The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.
The Kapaleeshwarar temple is of typical Dravidian architectural style, with the gopuram overpowering the street on which the temple sits. This temple is also a testimonial for the vishwakarmas sthapathis. There are two entrances to the temple marked by the gopuram on either side. The east gopuram is about 40 m high, while the smaller western gopuram faces the sacred tank.
The vahanas (Sanskrit for “vehicles”) at the temple include the bull, Adhikaranandi, elephant, bandicoot, peacock, goat and parrot, while a golden chariot is a recent addition. Statues of the god and the goddess are seated on a vahana or chariot which is brought in a procession around the temple while the temple band plays music. Devotees gather around the vahanas and consider it a privilege to pull / lift the God and the Goddess on the vahana. There is also a peacock and a peahen caged inside the temple, to symbolize the tradition that Karpagambal had come in the form of peahen to plead to Kapaleeshwarar.
The temple’s name is derived from the words kapalam (head) and eeshwarar an alias of lord Shiva. According to the Puranas, during the meeting of Brahma and Shiva at top of Mount Kailash Brahma failed to show the due respect to Shiva. Due to this, Shiva plucked of one of Brahma’s heads (kapalams). In an act of penance, Brahma came down to the site of Mylapore and installed a Lingam to please Shiva.This place is known as Sukra Puri, Veda Puri, among many other names including “Kailaye Mayilai and Mayilaye Kayilai “which means this place is equal to kailash. Goddess Karpagambal, a form of Shiva’s consort Parvati, due to a curse became a pea-hen and did penance here to get back her original personality. Shiva’s son Murugan received the spear (Sakthi Vel) for the destruction of a demon from Parvati here. Brahma had worshipped here to get rid of his ego and get back his power to create. The four Vedas have worshipped here. Sukracharya worshipped the Lord here and got back his lost eye. Rama has worshipped here and won the war against Ravana and brought back Sita from Lanka. The daughter of Sivanesa Chettiar Angam Poompavai got her lost life due to snake bite was later resurrected here by the powers of Thirugnana Sambandar. Vayilar Nayanar, a saiva saint, attained salvation here and Mylapore is also the birth place of Thiruvalluvar who wrote Thirukkural. In Thevaram special mention is made about the beautiful Madaveedhi as “Malgun Mathri Thavazhum Maada Veedhi Mylappil Ullar”. Thiruganana Sambandar, Arunagirinathar have sung the glory of Karpagambal, Singara Velar. The 10-day festival during March / April is a treat to watch and Arubathu Moovar festival is attended by lakhs of devotees every year.The commonly held view is that the temple was built in the 7th century CE by the ruling Pallavas.This view is based on references to the temple in the hymns of the Nayanars (which, however, place it by a sea shore). Thirugnanasambandar’s 6th song in Poompavaipathikam and Arunagirinathar’s 697th song in Thirumylai Thirupugazh, make clear reference to the Kapaleeswarar temple being located by a seashore.There are inscriptions dating back to 12th century inside the temple. The temple’s 120 ft gopuram (gateway tower) was built during 1906 with stucco figures adorning it. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.

https://www.bharattemples.com/brihadisvara-temple-thanjavur-tamil-nadu/,"Brihadisvara Temple, Ariyalur, Tamil Nadu
Brihadisvara Temple at Gangaikonda Cholapuram is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva in Gangaikonda Cholapuram, Ariyalur district, in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Completed in 1035 AD by Rajendra Chola I as a part of his new capital, this Choladynasty era temple is similar in design, and has a similar name, as the older 11th century, Brihadeeswarar Temple about 70 kilometres (43 mi) to the southwest in Thanjavur. The Gangaikonda Cholapuram Temple is smaller yet more refined than the Thanjavur Temple. Both are among the largest temples in South India and examples of Dravidian style temples. The temple is also referred to in texts as Gangaikonda Cholapuram Temple or Gangaikondacholeeswaram Temple .
The main temple dedicated to Shiva is based on a square plan, but it reverentially displays other Hindu deities such as Vishnu, Durga, Surya, Harihara, Ardhanarishvara, and others.[3][5] It opens to the sunrise and its sanctum, as well as the mandapas, are aligned on an east-west axis. In addition to the main shrine, the temple complex has a number of smaller shrines, gopura, and other monuments, with some partially ruined or restored in later centuries. The temple is famed for its bronze sculptures, artwork on its walls, the depiction of Nandi and the scale of its tower. As well as its notability for having been built by Rajendra I, the temple is also noteworthy for its numerous inscriptions, although none of them are his.
Except for this temple, the old city of Gangaikonda Cholapuram – the capital of a powerful Asian empire for over two centuries along with its other major Chola-era Hindu temples have been completely destroyed, leaving a desolate place. The Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple remains an active temple. Four daily rituals, and many yearly festivals are held there, of which the Shivarathriduring the Tamil month of Masi (February–March), Aipassi Pournami during Aipassi (October– November) and Thiruvadirai during Margazhi (December–January) are the most prominent. It is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Tamil Nadu. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) administers the temple as a protected heritage monument. UNESCO declared it a World Heritage Site in 2004, along with the Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur and Airavatesvara temple at Darasuram. These are referred to collectively as the Great Living Chola Temples.
A spectrum of Hindu temple styles continued to develop from the 5th to the 9th century over the Chalukya era rule as evidenced in Aihole, Badami and Pattadakal, and then with the Pallava era as witnessed at Mamallapuram and other monuments. Thereafter, between 850 and 1280 CE, Cholas emerged as the dominant dynasty.The early Chola period saw a greater emphasis on securing their geopolitical boundaries and less emphasis on architecture. In the 10th century, within the Chola empire emerged features such as the multifaceted columns with projecting square capitals. This, states George Michell, signaled the start of the new Chola style. This South Indian style is most fully realized both in scale and detail in the Brihadeshvara temple built between 1003 and 1010 by the Chola king Rajaraja.The architect and engineer of the temple was Kunjara Mallan Raja Raja Rama Perunthachan as stated in inscriptions found at the temple.
The main temple along with its gopurams are from the early 11th century. The temple also saw additions, renovations, and repairs over the next 1,000 years. The raids and wars, particularly between Muslim Sultans who controlled Madurai and Hindu kings who controlled Thanjavur caused damage.These were repaired by Hindu dynasties that regained control. In some cases, the rulers attempted to renovate the temple with faded paintings, by ordering new murals on top of the older ones. In other cases, they sponsored addition of shrines. The significant shrines of Kartikeya (Murugan), Parvati (Amman) and Nandi are from the 16th and 17th-century Nayaka era.Similarly the Dakshinamurti shrine was built later.
The Brihadeeswarar Temple is located near the village of Gangaikonda Cholapuram, about 280 kilometres (170 mi) southwest of Chennaiand 50 kilometres (31 mi) from Chidambaram. Roughly 70 kilometres (43 mi) to the northeast is the similarly named Chola dynasty era Brihadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur, and is about 30 kilometres (19 mi) to the northeast of the Airavatesvara Temple. All three are UNESCO world heritage sites.
The temple is on Highway 81 connecting Tiruchirappalli and Chidambaram.The nearby city of Chidambaram is connected to other major cities by daily trains on the Indian railway network, Tamil Nadu bus services and National Highways 36, 81, and 245.The nearest airport with regular services is Tiruchirappalli International Airport about 120 kilometres (75 mi) away.
Though inland, the temple is near the Kollidam River, within the Cauveri River delta with access to the Bay of Bengal and through it to the Indian Ocean.

Tirunelveli is one of the many temple towns in the state which is named after the grooves, clusters or forests dominated by a particular variety of a tree or shrub and the same variety of tree or shrub sheltering the presiding deity. The region is believed to have been covered with Venu forest and hence called Venuvanam.
According to the puranas, both the Gopurams were built by Pandyas and the sanctums of the temple were constructed by Nindraseer Nedumaran who reigned in the 7th century. The mani mandapam with its famous musical pillar was built by Later Pandyas in the 7th century. Originally the Nellaiappar and Kanthimathi temples were two independent structures with spaces in between. It was in 1647 that Thiru Vadamalaiappa Pillaiyan, a great devotee of Siva linked the two temples by building the “Chain mandapam” (In Tamil Sangili Mandapam). To the western portion of the chain mandapam is the flower garden that was set up in 1756 by Thiruvengadakrishna Mudaliar. In the centre of the Flower Garden is a square vasantha mandapam with 100 pillars. The Nandi mandapam is said to have been built by Sivanthiappa Nayak in 1654. The flag stand near the Nandi was set up in 1155.
There are a number of stone inscriptions in the temple. The most important of them are those Veerapandiyan who regained about 950 and those of Rajendran I and Kulothunga Chola I. The inscriptions of Maravarman Sundara Pandyan refer to the Lord as “Woodayar” and “Wodeyanayanar” and the Goddess as “Nachiar”. From the inscriptions of Kulasekkara Pandiyan we learn that he defeated the Chera, Chola and Hoysala kings and built the outer walls of the temple with the war booty.

Gangaikonda Cholapuram is a town located in Ariyalur, Tamil Nadu, India. It became the capital of the Chola dynasty in c. 1025 during the reign of Rajendra Chola I, and served as the Chola capital for around 250 years.
The town is about 70 kilometres (43 mi) northeast of Thanjavur city. As of 2014, the ancient city exists as a heritage town in the Ariyalur district of Tamil Nadu, India. The great temple of Brihadeeswarar Temple at this place is next only to the Brihadisvara temple at Thanjavur in its monumental nature and surpasses it in sculptural quality.
Ariyalur is best known for the Gangaikondacholisvarar temple in Gangaikondacholapuram, the biggest temple constructed during the reign of Rajendra–I in Ariyalur region. Following the conquest of the Gangetic plains in A.D. 1023 Rajendra–I built a great city called Gangaikondacholapauram and a Siva temple Gangaikondacholisvarar and a lake Chola Gangam in commemoration of his victory. The place, the temple and the lake (Chola Gangam) are the living embodiments of the heroism of the Tamils who unfurled the Chola‘s Tiger flag on the banks of the River Ganges. He also shifted his capital from Thanjavur to this newly built town. From his period to the end of the Chola family rule in A.D.1279 this city was the capital for the Chola Empire for a period of 256 years. The gigantic stone temple which he built in this place is rich repository of beautiful sculptures of middle Chola period. This city is celebrated in the literature of Muvar ula of Ottakuttar and Kalingattuparani of Jayankondar.
Rajendra’s Gangetic expedition was over by his 11th regal year (A.D.1023). The earliest reference which mentions the city of Gangaikondacholapuram is a record of A. D. 1027 of him. Hence it is evident that the city was built in memory of his great victory between A.D. 1023 and 1027. The recently discovered Esalam Copper plates of A.D. 1036 of Rajendra–I give concrete evidence that he built the Gangaikondacholisvarar temple. Another record of A.D. 1068 of Virarajendra in Gangaikondacholapuram which is the earliest record in the temple mentions about the grant of villages to the Gangaikondacholisvarar temple by Rajendra-I in his 24th year (A.D. 1036). These evidences indicate that the siva temple was built between A.D. 1023 and 1036 although the earliest extant record in this big temple belongs to A. D. 1068 of Virarajendra.
This temple is a living history of the Cholas in stone from the period of Rajendra-I and a beautiful gallery of Chola art and architecture. Many sculptures brought from Andhra, Karnataka and Bengal as war trophies are also preserved in the temple and in the nearby villages. Chandesura Anugraha Murthy and Sarasvathy are the most beautiful sculptures of the temple.
At present it is under the control of ASI and the HR&CE and recently the UNESCO declared the temple as one of the world heritage monument.
The city was founded by Rajendra Chola I to commemorate his victory over the Pala Dynasty. The name means The town of the chola who took over Ganga (water from Ganga) or who defeated (the kings near) Ganga. It is now a small village, its past eminence only remembered by the existence of the great Lord Maha Shiva Temple. The Chola empire included the whole of southern India to the river Thungabadhra in the north. For administrative and strategic purposes they built another capital and named it Gangaikondacholapuram.
The city seems to have had two fortifications, one inner and the other outer. The outer was probably wider. The remains of the outer fortification can be seen as a mound running all around the palace.
Excavations suggest that the outer fortification was built of burnt bricks, was about six to eight feet wide. It consisted of two walls, the intervening space (the core) being filled with sand. The bricks are fairly large in size and are made of well-burnt clay.
The surviving temple in Gangaikonda Cholapuram was completed in 1035 AD.[4] Rajendra emulated the temple built by his father after his victory in a campaign across India that Chola era texts state covered Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and Bengal. After his victory, he demanded that the defeated kingdoms send pots of Ganges River water and pour it into the well of this temple.[2]
Rajendra I, states the Tamil tradition, thereafter assumed the name of Gangaikonda Cholan, meaning the one who conquered the Ganges. He established Gangaikonda Cholapuram as his capital from the medieval Chola capital of Thanjavur, which would go on to become the capital for the next 250 years. Rajendra I built the entire capital with several temples using plans and infrastructure recommended in Tamil Vastu and Agama sastra texts. These included a Dharma Sasta, Vishnu and other temples. However, all of these were destroyed in late 13th and 14th centuries except the Brihadishvara temple. The other Chola landmarks are evidenced by soil covered mounds and excavated broken pillar stumps and brick walls found over an area of several kilometers from the surviving temple.
The reasons for the city’s destruction are unclear. According to Vansanthi, the Pandyas who defeated the Cholas during the later part of 13th century “may have raged the city to ground” to avenge their previous defeats.However, it is unclear why other temples were destroued and this temple was spared, as well as why there are around 20 inscriptions from later Cholas, Pandyas and Vijayanagar Empire indicting various gifts and grants to this temple.An alternate theory links the destruction to the raids and wars, particularly with the invasion of the capital city and the territories that were earlier a part by the Chola Empire along with Madurai by the armies of Delhi Sultanate led by the Muslim commander Malik Kafur in 1311, followed by Khusrau Khan in 1314 and Muhammad bin Tughlaq in 1327. The period that followed saw wars between the Hindu kings and the Muslim Sultans who seceded the Delhi Sultanate and carved out new polity such as the nearby Madurai Sultanate (1335–1378).The Vijayanagara Empire defeated the Madurai Sultanate in 1378 and this temple along with other Chola era temples thereafter came under Hindu kings again who repaired and restored many of them.

Arulmigu Subramanyaswamy Temple,Pachaimalai,Modachur,
Gobichettipalayam – 638476
Pachaimalai Arulmigu Subramanyaswamy Temple ‘ (Pachaimalai Balamurugan Temple} is one of the two major hill temples (other being Pavalamalai) located in Gobichettipalayam, Tamil Nadu, dedicated to Tamil God Murugan. The temple constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, is located on top of a small hillock in the outskirts of the town of Gobichettipalayam.
The temple has a five-storey main Gopuram built according to the Dravidian architecture. The main deity is Balamurugan, the child form of Lord Murugan. The main deity faces west similar to Palani Dhandayuthapani temple. The temple also has a colossal statue of Lord Muruga, which is visible from the town of Gobichettipalayam. The statue measures 40 ft and is one of the largest Senthilandavar statues in the state. The temple also has shrines dedicated to various gods and goddesses including Vidya Ganapathy, Maragatheeswarar and His consort Maragathavalli, Kalyana Subramanyar with His consorts Valliand Deivanai, Maragatha Venkatesa Perumal with His consorts Sridevi and Bhoodevi, Dakshinamurthi, Bhairavar and the Navagraha.[3] The speciality of Navagraha is that they can be seen with their consorts seated on their respective mounts. This is very rare.
In Tamil grammar, land mass in this world is divided into five types of eco-systems. Mountain, hill and associated area is called ‘Kurinji’. The lord of Kurinji is Murugan and he has made the hills as his abode. Majority of all hill temples found in Tamil Nadu and elsewhere are dedicated to Lord Subramanyar.
Once upon a time, Saint Dhurvasar reached Kunnathur that lies 18 km south of present Gobi town. When he worshiped at the Shiva temple at Kunnathur, he found out that a place called Modachur on the outskirts of present Gobi town is a good place to perform his routine worship of Shiva. While worshipping Shiva, he wanted to have Darshan of Lord Subramanya. Not finding a temple in close quarters, he went into penance to find out the best place to have Darshan of Lord Muruga. He found through his penance that there is a Subramanya temple on a small hill at a distance of around 1.5 km from Modachur and the main deity faced west. The saint reached the hillock to find Lord Subramanya and was overjoyed and mesmerised by his beauty. He then decided to continue his penance from there. He also learnt the similarities between the temple and Palani where the Lord is facing west as Dhandapani.
All these events were forgotten as time proceeded. Around 1954, a landlord named P. K. Kuppuswamy Gounder visited the temple. He is said to have seen a Jyothi (Light) at the shrine[ and was asked to take care of the temple by a heavenly voice. On his initiative, regular pooja was started in the temple. He also pioneered to renovate the Temple and the Karpagraha was constructed out of polished black granite.
Starting then, the renovation moved into a fast pace. First Swarnabandhana Maha Kumbabishekam was performed in 1980 led by P. K. Eswaran as renovation committee head. Since then, scores of people have joined the renovation committee and lot of work has happened in the temple.
The latest and Second Swarnabandhana Kumbabishekam was performed around June 2006. It is uncommon to find Swarnabandhanam being done for the deities. You can really count the number of temples where Swarnabandhanam (Gold plating the base of statue where it stands) has been performed for deities in Tamil Nadu and elsewhere.
Pachaimalai is located 3Kms from Gobi town centre. There are two ways to reach Pachaimalai from Gobi town: one from Modachur (Gobi – Kunnathur Road) and another from Karattur (Erode – Sathy Main Road). As there are no buses, one can hire an auto/taxi to reach Pachaimalai.

Sikkal Singara Velan Temple is one of the most popular Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Muruga and a contender for the unofficial seventh Padaiveedu of Muruga, along with the popular Arupadaiveedu (six abodes of Lord Muruga).
It is one of the rare traditional Hindu temples that has both Shiva and Vishnu deities in the same complex.
It is believed in Hindu mythology that this place was once a jasmine forest and due to its pleasant smell, the semi-human goddess with cow’s trunk, Kamadenu lives here. Once upon a time, Kamadenu was cursed by lord Shiva, when it ate meat. Later feeling guilty of its action, it got rid of its sin by taking bath in the holy water point of this temple and worshiped here, as told by Lord Shiva. After getting rid of the sin, Kamadenu offered its milk which later became Parkulam (literal meaning the milk pond), which is located behind the temple. It is this holy water point (The Parkulam) of the temple where Vashistha Maharishi performed a pooja here, by making a lingam with the butter from the Parkulam. After completing the pooja he tried to move that lingam, but it stuck to that place, and never moved. As a result, Vasista Maharishi regarded this place as sikkal.
It is also said that Lord Murugan had got his Vel (weapon) from his divine mother at Sikkal, to kill the asura, Soorapadman in Sri Lanka. He performed Soora Samharam (literal meaning: killing Soorapadman) by setting up the base camp in Thiruchendur.

Pazhamudircholai Murugan Temple is a Hindu temple, located about 25 kilometres north of Madurai, India atop a hill covered with dense forests. One of the six important abodes (Arupadaiveedu) of Lord Muruga, it is close to the Vishnu temple of Azhagar Kovil. It is said that the Azhagar Kovil was the actual temple for the main deity of the temple, and the deity was later shifted or relocated to Pazhamudircholai during Thirumalai Nayak’s rule in Madurai.
The great Tamil poet and saint Avvaiyar was tested by Muruga here.In an episode of Divine Play with Avvaiyar, one of the most famous devotees of Muruga, the Lord enacted the following drama. One day Avvaiyar became tired while traveling under the hot sun and sought refuge under the shadow of a fruit tree, hungry and thirsty, when a boy who sitting on the tree asked her whether she wanted fruits from the tree. When Avvaiyar told him that she did, the boy asked Avvaiyar whether she wanted roasted fruits or unroasted fruits. Avvaiyar who was a famous Tamil poet and incredibly knowledgeable litterateur scoffed silently at the very thought of the existence of a “roasted fruit” and decided that the boy didn’t have knowledge even about a fruit. However, tired as she was, she decided that she didn’t want to argue with the boy and asked him to pick unroasted fruits for her, which the boy then proceeded to do. Several fruits fell out of the tree and Avvaiyar picked them up,blowing on them to remove the sand. Smiling, the boy asked Avvaiyar if she was blowing on his “roasted fruits” to cool them down.
Avvaiyar was astonished as to how a small village cowboy could have played such an intelligent drama. Blowing on the fruit to remove the sand was indeed poetically comparable to an attempt to cool “roasted fruits”. Humbled by the immense poetic knowledge and clever wordplay of the boy, Avvaiyar begged the boy to reveal his true identity, unable to reconcile herself with the fact that a simple cowherd could have such profound thoughts. The boy then disappeared and in his place, Muruga appeared. Avvaiyar, stunned to find herself in Divine Company, bowed in obeisance and realising the infinite nature of knowledge, prayed to Muruga to bless her and continue bestowing his Infinite Grace on her to aid her virtually endless quest for knowledge.
Pazhamudircholai is a fertile hill, blessed with nature’s bounty in the form of innumerable fruits, vegetables and natural springs. It is a dense forest where Valli is supposed to have lived. The temple itself is relatively small with Valli, Deivayanai, and Lord Muruga in a separate shrine. Lord Ganesha is also present in a separate shrine. There is a Temple Tower and monkeys play around the area. There is another small temple above Pazhamudhir Cholai where local tribes lead their lives.
Although there are hundreds of Temples in Tamil Nadu for Lord Muruga, six particular temples called Arupadaiveedu are very famous among them. Important events in Lord Muruga’s history happened in these places.
Among the Arupadaiveedu, Pazhamudircholai is the last. Lord Muruga at Pazhamudircholai is praised in several works of old Tamil literature such as the Silappathikaram, the Ettuthokai and the Pattupattu.

The temple has two shrines, namely, Murugan in the form of Shaktidharar and the shrines of Valli and Deivayanai in two other shrines.
The origins of this temple, like most Hindu temples, are buried in antiquity. This temple has been mentioned in the Sangam period work Tirumurugaatruppadai composed by Nakkeerar. It has been patronized by the Vijayanagar rulers and local chieftains and zamindars. The original animal mount of Murugan is believed to have been an elephant, compared to the peacock which is considered to be the most common mount. The white elephant, is considered a powerful, terror striking animal. The iconography is maintained only in two places, namely, this temple and Tiruttani Murugan Temple.
Legend also has it that Indra the king of the Gods gave his daughter Deivayanai in marriage to Skanda, and along with her presented his elephant Airavatam as part of his dowry offering. Upon Airavatam’s departure Indra found his wealth waning. Subramanyar is said to have offered to return the white elephant, however Indra bound by protocol refused to accept a gift that he had made, and insisted that the elephant face his direction, hence the image of the elephant in this temple also faces the east.
Another legend has it that Indra presented a sandal stone as a part of his daughter’s dowry. The sandal paste made on this stone is applied to the image of Subramanya and the applied paste is said to acquire medicinal value. Legend also has it that Skanda bore the discus thrown by the demon Tarakasuran on his chest, and hence there is a hollow in the chest region of the image of Subramanya in this temple. Legend also has it that Skanda gifted the discus to Vishnu. Skanda is also believed to have imparted knowledge of Tamil to the sage Agasthyar and he is regarded as Veeramurthy, Gnanamurthy and Acharyamurthy in this shrine.
Lord Rama, after putting an end to Ravana, worshipped Lord Siva at Rameswaram and then came to Tiruttani to find perfect peace of mind by worshipping Lord Subrahmanya here. In Dwapara Yuga, Arjuna got the blessings by offering prayers to Him on his way to the South for Teertha Yatra (pilgrimage to take sacred immersion). Vishnu prayed to the Lord and got back his powerful Chakra (sacred wheel), Shanku (sacred conch), which were forcibly seized from him by Tarakasura, brother of Soorapadma. Lord Brahma propitiated the Lord here at the holy spring known as Brahmasonai after his imprisonment by our Lord for his failure to explain the Pranava (‘Om’ mantra) and got back his creative function of which he was deprived by our Lord due to his egotistic impudence in neglecting to worship Subrahmanya on his way to Mount Kailasa to worship Siva. The final steps to the eastern entrance.
On worshipping at Thanikai, the king of snakes Vasuki got his bodily wounds healed, which had been caused during the churning process in the Milky Ocean to secure the Amrita(nectar of immortality) by the devas and asuras when the Mantotra Mountain was used as the churning base and the snake king Vasuki as the rope. Sage Agasthyar Muni (of Potikai Hill) worshipped Muruga at Tanikai when he was blessed with the divine gift of the Tamil language.

Indra, the king of Devas was impressed and he married Deivayanai, his divine daughter to Muruga at Thiruparamkundram. Muruga is believed to have worshipped Shiva here as Parangirinathar. Kanthar Anoobothi, a treatise of the divine marriage records that Muruga asked all the divine angels and gods who attended the marriage to fly back to heaven in their own vehicles in Mano veham(speed of thought)nscriptional evidences point out that this temple, being carved out of a hill, was most probably earlier a Jain cave. There is another theory that earlier to this, the Murugan temple existed much before the 6th century and converted into Jain worship centre by Jain monks under the aegis of Pandya king Koon pandiyan. The temple was later converted into a Hindu temple under the tutelage of Gajapathy, the minister of a later Pandya King, during the later part of the 8th century. The temple has several additions during the regime of Madurai Nayaks who commissioned the pillared halls in the temple. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.

The temple was greatly damaged during the Anglo-French war between Hyder Ali and British in 1740. The temple, in modern times, is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.
In Swamimalai, Muruga is known as “Balamurugan” and “Swaminatha Swami”. The temple is built on an artificial hill. In Tamil language, such an artificial hill is called “Kattu Malai”. Another name for this place is “Thiruveragam”. The temple has three gopuram(gateway towers) and three precincts. Out of the three precincts, one is located in the basement, the second at midway to the top of the hillock and the third on the hillock, around the sanctum of the Swaminathaswamy shrine. There are sixty steps and each one is named after the sixty Tamil years. The first thirty steps lead to the second precinct of the temple. The image of Swaminathaswamy is 6 ft (1.8 m) tall. There are golden armours, golden crowns and a diamond lance for Swaminathaswamy. There is a shrine of Vinayagar outside the first precinct. The central shrine houses the granite image of Swaminathaswamy. The first precinct has the images of Dakshinamurthy, Durga, Chandikeswarar and the festival image of Swaminathaswamy. The images of Sundaresawar as lingam (Shiva) and Meenakshi (Parvathi) are located down hill and the first precinct around their shrines have the images of Dakshinamurthy, Durga, Chandikeswarar and Navagrahas. The second precinct and the largest one of the temple houses a marriage hall and the chariot of the temple.The temple is one of the most visited temples in the district. The original animal mount of Murugan is believed to have been an elephant, compared to the peacock which is considered to be the most common mount. The white elephant, is considered a powerful, terror striking animal. The iconography is maintained only in two places, namely, this temple and Tiruttani Murugan Temple.Unlike other Murugan temples, where peacock is sported axial to the image of the presiding deity, an elephant is seen in front of Murugan in the temple.
As per Hindu legend, Brahma, the Hindu god of creation, disrespected Muruga (the son of Shiva) at the time of visiting Mount Kailash, the abode of Shiva. The child Muruga got angry with Brahma and asked him how he was creating living beings. Brahma said that he was creating living beings with the help of the Vedas (Hindu scriptures). On hearing the reply, Muruga asked Brahma to recite the texts from Vedas. Brahma started to recite the text with the holy word called Pranav Mantra, “Om”. At that time Muruga stopped Brahma and asked him to explain the meaning of the Pranava Mantra. Brahma did not expect such a question from the child and could not reply.Muruga knocked Brahma on his forehead with his clenched fists and punished him with imprisonment. Muruga took up the role of the creator. The Devas (celestial deities) were surprised by the absence of Brahma and they requested Vishnu to negotiate with Muruga to release Brahma. Vishnu could not help and as the last resort, Shiva went to the rescue of Brahma.
Shiva came to Muruga and asked him to release Brahma from imprisonment. Muruga refused to release him stating Brahma was unaware of the meaning of the Om – Shiva asked Muruga to explain the meaning and Muruga extolled to Shiva the meaning of Om. Shiva behaved like a student to a teacher, listening with rapt attention from his son, giving Muruga the name “Swaminatha Swami”.The meaning of this name is “The Teacher of Shiva”.Following the legend, the shrine of the son Muruga is atop the hillock, while the father Shiva’s shrine is located at the basement.
As per another legend, once all sages and gods assembled in Kailash, the abode of Shiva. It resulted in the tilting of earth towards one direction. Shiva asked sage Agasthya to move towards South to balance the tilt. Agastya employed a demon by name Ettumba to carry two hills in his shoulders to be placed in the South. The demon carried the hills down south and rested in a place. When he tried to lift one of the hills, it didn’t budge and he found a young man standing at the top of the hill not allowing it to be moved. The demon tried to attack the young man, but was smitten. Sage Agastya identified the young man as Karthikeya and asked him to pardon the demon. Karthikeya readily did so and let the hill remain there at Pazhani. It is a practice followed in the modern times where people carry milk in both their shoulders as a devotion to please Karthikeya. The demon carried the other hill to Swamimalai.

https://www.bharattemples.com/palani-murugan-temple-dindigul-tamil-nadu/,"Palani Murugan temple, Dindigul, Tamil Nadu
Palani Arulmigu Shri Dhandayuthapani temple is one of the Six Abodes of Murugan. It is located in the town of Palani in Dindigul district, 100 kilometres (62 mi) southeast of Coimbatore and northwest of Madurai in the foot-hills of the Palani hills, Tamil Nadu, India. Palani temple is considered synonymous with Panchamritam, a sweet mixture made of five ingredients.
As per Hindu legendary beliefs, Sage Narada visited the celestial court of Shiva at Mount Kailash to present to him a fruit, the gnana-palam (literally, the fruit of knowledge). He decided to award it to whichever of his two sons who first encircle the world thrice. Accepting the challenge, Murugan([Karthikeya]) started his journey around the globe on his mount peacock. However, Ganesha, who surmised that the world was no more than his parents Shiva and Shakti combined, circumambulated them and won the fruit. Murugan was furious and felt the need to get matured from boyhood and hence chose to remain as a hermit in Palani . The idol of the Muruga in Palani was created and consecrated by sage Bogar, one of Hinduism’s eighteen great siddhaas, out of an amalgam of nine poisons or navapashanam.
Other than the steps and sliding elephant way, there is a winch and rope car service used for transportation of devotees uphill. Six poojas are performed from 6.00 a.m. to 8.00 p.m and special poojas on festival days in the temple, when it is open from 4.30 a.m. As of 2016, the temple was the richest among temples in the state with a collection of 33 crore during the period of July 2015 to June 2016.
The idol of the deity is said to be made of an amalgam of nine poisonous substances which forms an eternal medicine when mixed in a certain ratio. It is placed upon a pedestal of stone, with an archway framing it and represents the god Subrahmanya in the form He assumed at Palani – that of a very young recluse, shorn of his locks and all his finery, dressed in no more than a loincloth and armed only with a staff, the dhandam, as befits a monk.
The temple was re-consecrated by the Cheras, whose dominions lay to the west, and the guardian of whose eastern frontier was supposed to be the Kartikeya of Palani. Housed in the garbhagriham, the sanctum sanctorum, of the temple, the deity may be approached and handled only by the temple’s priests, who are members of the Gurukkal community of Palani, and hold hereditary rights of sacerdotal worship at the temple. Other devotees are permitted to come up to the sanctum, while the priests’ assistants, normally of the Pandāramcommunity, are allowed up to the ante-chamber of the sanctum sanctorum.
The temple is situated upon the higher of the two hills of Palani, known as the Sivagiri. Traditionally, access to it was by the main staircase cut into the hill-side or by the yanai-padhai or elephant’s path, used by the ceremonial elephants. Pilgrims bearing water for the ritual bathing of the idol, and the priests, would use another way also carved into the hill-side but on the opposite side. Over the past half-century, three funicular railway tracks have been laid up the hill for the convenience of the pilgrims, and supplemented by a rope-way within the past decade. There are two modes of transport from the foothills to uphill. There is a winch, which operate from 6 a.m. on ordinary days and 4 a.m. during festive occasions. There is another rope car which operates from 7 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 1:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. Both winch and the rope car are closed after the Irakkala Pooja at 8 p.m.The sanctum of the temple is of early Chera architecture while the covered ambulatory that runs around it bears unmistakable traces of Pandya influence, especially in the form of the two fishes, the Pandyan royal insignia. The walls of the sanctum bear extensive inscriptions in the old Tamil script. Surmounting the sanctum, is a gopuram of gold, with numerous sculptures of the presiding deity, Kartikeya, and gods and goddesses attendant upon him. In the first inner prahāram, or ambulatory, around the heart of the temple, are two minor shrines, one each, to Shiva and Parvati, besides one to the sage Bhogar who is by legend credited with the creation and consecration of the chief idol. In the second precinct, is a celebrated shrine of Ganapati, besides the carriage-house of the Muruga’s Golden Chariot.
Sage Narada once visited the celestial court of Shiva at Mount Kailash to present to him a fruit, the gyana-palam (literally, the fruit of knowledge), that held in it the elixir of wisdom. Upon Shiva expressing his intention of dividing the fruit between his two sons, Ganesha and Murugan,the sage counseled against cutting it. He decided to award it to whichever of his two sons first circled the world thrice. Accepting the challenge, Karthikeya started his journey around the globe on his mount peacock. However, Ganesha, who surmised that the world was no more than his parents Shiva and Shakticombined, circumambulated them. Pleased with their son’s discernment, Shiva awarded the fruit to Ganesha. When Kartikeya returned, he was furious to learn that his efforts had been in vain. He left Kailash and took up his abode in Palani hills in South India. It is believed that Karthikeya felt the need to get matured from boyhood and hence chose to remain as a hermit and discarded all his robes and ornaments. He went into meditation to know about himself.
As per another legend, once all sages and gods assembled in Kailash, the abode of Shiva. It resulted in the tilting of earth towards one direction. Shiva asked sage Agathiyar to move towards South to balance the tilt. Agastya employed a demon by name Ettumba to carry two hills in his shoulders to be placed in the South. The demon carried the hills down south and rested in a place. When he tried to lift one of the hills, it didn’t budge and he found a young man standing at the top of the hill not allowing it to be moved. The demon tried to attack the young man, but was defeated. Sage Agastya identified the young man as Murugan(Karthikeya) and asked him to pardon the demon. Murugan readily did so and let the hill remain there at Pazhani. It is a practice followed in the modern times where people carry milk in both their shoulders as a devotion to please the lord. The demon carried the other hill to Swamimalai, which is another of the six abodes of lord Murugan.
The idol of the Muruga in Palani, was created and consecrated by sage Bogar, one of aaseevaham’s (Ancient Tamil Culture) eighteen great siddhas out of an amalgam of nine poisons or navapashanam. The legend also holds that, the sculptor had to work very rapidly to complete its features, but that he spent so much time in creating the face, he did not have time to bestow but a rough grace upon the rest of the body, thus explaining the contrast between the artistic perfection of the face and the slightly less accomplished work upon the body. A shrine to Bhogar exists in the southwestern corridor of the temple, which, by legend, is said to be connected by a subterranean tunnel to a cave in the heart of the hill, where Bhogar continues to meditate and maintain his vigil, with eight idols of Muruga.
The deity, after centuries of worship, fell into neglect and was suffered to be engulfed by the forest. One night, Perumal a king of the Chera Dynastys, who controlled the area between the second and fifth centuries A.D., wandered from his hunting party and was forced to take refuge at the foot of the hill. It so befell, that the Subrahmanyan, appeared to him in a dream, and ordered him to restore the idol to its former state. The king commenced a search for the idol, and finding it, constructed the temple that now houses it, and re-instituted its worship. This is commemorated by a small stela at the foot of the staircase that winds up the hill.

https://www.bharattemples.com/meenakshi-temple-madurai-tamil-nadu/,"Meenakshi Temple, Madurai, Tamil Nadu
Meenakshi Amman Temple, also known as Minakshi-Sundareshwara Temple, is one of the oldest and most important temples in India. Located in the city of Madurai, the temple has a great mythological and historical significance. It is believed that Lord Shiva assumed the form of Sundareswarar (the handsome one) and married Parvati (Meenakshi) at the site where the temple is currently located. Renowned for its astonishing architecture, Meenakshi Temple was nominated as one of the wonders of the world, but couldn’t make it into the list of ‘Seven Wonders of the World’. However, the temple is definitely one of the ‘Wonders of India’. It is also one of the main attractions of South India with thousands of devotees thronging it every day. During the ‘Tirukalyanam Festival,’ which takes place over a period of 10 days, the temple attracts more than a million devotees. Despite many people visiting it every day, the temple is well-maintained and was named the ‘Best Swachh Iconic Place’ (cleanest iconic place) in India.
The history of Meenakshi Temple dates back to the 1st century C.E with scholars claiming it to be as old as the city itself. It is said that Kulashekarar Pandyan, a king who ruled over the Pandyan dynasty, built the temple as per the instructions given in his dream by Lord Shiva. A few religious texts that belong to the 1st to 4th century C.E talk about the temple and describe it as the central structure of the city. Texts dating back to the early 6th century, describe the temple as a place where scholars met to discuss important topics. The temple as it stands today, however, was rebuilt throughout the 16th century as it was destroyed by the Muslim invaders.
During the 14th century C.E, Malik Kafur, a commander of Delhi Sultanate, led his army into most parts of southern India and looted many temples including the famed Meenakshi Temple. Valuables, such as gold, silver and precious gems were taken to Delhi. Since temples in those days had abundance of valuables, most of the temples were destroyed and were left in ruins. When the Vijayanagar Empire took over Madurai after defeating the Muslim Sultanate, the temple was rebuilt and reopened. The temple was further expanded during the late 16th century and early 17th century by Vishwanatha Nayakar, a king of the Nayaka dynasty. According to researchers, while rebuilding the temple, the rulers of Nayaka dynasty followed the architectural style of ‘Silpa Shastras.’ ‘Silpa Shastras’ are a set of architectural laws found in the ancient texts.
Meenakshi Temple, also referred to as Meenakshi Amman or Minakshi-Sundareshwara Temple,is a historic Hindu temple located on the southern bank of the Vaigai River in the temple city of Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India. It is dedicated to Meenakshi, a form of Parvati, and her consort, Sundareshwar, a form of Shiva. The temple is at the center of the ancient temple city of Madurai mentioned in the Tamil Sangam literature, with the goddess temple mentioned in 6th century CE texts.
Though the temple has historic roots, most of the present campus structure was rebuilt after the 14th century CE, further repaired, renovated and expanded in the 17th century by Thirumalai Nayak.In the early 14th century, the armies of Delhi Sultanate led by Muslim Commander Malik Kafur plundered the temple, looted it of its valuables and destroyed the Madurai temple town along with many other temple towns of South India. The contemporary temple is the result of rebuilding efforts started by the Vijayanagara Empire rulers who rebuilt the core and reopened the temple. In the 16th century, the temple complex was further expanded and fortified by the Nayak ruler Vishwanatha Nayakar and later others. The restored complex now houses 14 gopurams(gateway towers), ranging from 45–50m in height, with the southern gopura tallest at 51.9 metres (170 ft). The complex has numerous sculpted pillared halls such as Ayirakkal (1,000 pillar hall), Kilikoondu-mandapam, Golu-mandapam and Pudu-mandapam. Its shrines are dedicated to Hindu deities and Shaivism scholars, with the vimanas above the garbhagrihas (sanctums) of Meenakshi and Sundaresvara gilded with gold.
The temple is a major pilgrimage destination within the Shaivism tradition, dedicated to Meenakshi Devi and Shiva. However, the temple includes Vishnu in many narratives, sculptures and rituals as he is considered to be Meenakshi’s brother. This has made this temple and Madurai as the “southern Mathura”,one included in Vaishnava texts.The Meenakshi temple also includes Lakshmi, flute playing Krishna, Rukmini, Brahma, Saraswati, other Vedic and Puranic deities, as well as artwork showing narratives from major Hindu texts. The large temple complex is the most prominent landmark in Madurai and attracts tens of thousands visitors a day.The temple attracts over a million pilgrims and visitors during the annual 10-day Meenakshi Tirukalyanam festival, celebrated with much festivities and a ratha (chariot) procession during the Tamil month of Chittirai (overlaps with April–May in Georgian calendar, Chaitra in North India).The Temple has been adjudged best ‘Swachh Iconic Place’ in India as on October 1, 2017 under Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi’s Flagship Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.

https://www.bharattemples.com/ucchi-pillayar-temple-rockfort-tiruchirappalli-tamil-nadu/,"Ucchi Pillayar Temple, Rockfort, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu
Ucchi Pillayar koil, is a 7th century Hindu temple, one dedicated to Lord Ganesha located a top of Rockfort, Trichy, Tamil Nadu, India. Historically this rock is the place where Lord Ganesha ran from King Vibishana, after establishing the Ranganathaswamy deity in Srirangam. Tiruchirapalli Rock Fort is also fondly called as in Tamil.
The Rock Fort temple stands 83m tall perched atop the rock. The smooth rock was first cut by the Pallavas but it was the Nayaks of Madurai who completed both the temples under the Vijayanagara empire.
The temple is situated at the top of the rock. The temple is mystic in its nature with an awe-inspiring rock architecture. The Ganesha temple is much smaller with an access through steep steps carved on the rock and provides a stunning view of Trichy, Srirangam and the rivers Kaveri and Kollidam. Due to its ancient and impressive architecture created by the Pallavas, the temple is maintained by the Archaeological department of India.
Vibhishana, was the younger brother of the Asura King Ravana who ruled Lanka. Lord Rama in the epic of Ramayana rescues his wife Sita, who was kidnapped and held by Ravana, with the help of Sugriva and Hanuman defeated him. In this war, the moral and truth-abiding brother of Ravana, Vibishana aids Rama in his battle against his brother. Ultimately Rama wins the war and as a token of love, he gives Vibishana a vigraham (idol for worship) of Lord Ranganatha, a form of Vishnu.
Vibhishana, though he supported Rama, was basically an Asura, hence the Devas (who are arch rivals to Asuras as per Hindu mythology) wanted to stop this idea of an Asura taking Lord’s supreme form to his Kingdom. They request the help of the Remover of obstacles and God of learning, Lord Vinayaka and the Lord accepts the plan. Vibhishana, while on his back to his Kingdom, goes through Trichi, and wanted to take his bath in the river Kaveri and do his daily rituals. However, he is perplexed as the deity, once kept in land, can never be removed and has to be in that place forever.
As a solution, Vibishana tries to find someone to hold the deity while he was taking bath. He finds the Lord Vinayaka under disguise of a cowherd boy. As per the plan, when Vibishana is fully into water, Vinayaka takes the deity and keeps it firmly in sand, in the banks of kaveri. On seeing this, the angry Vibhishana chases the boy, to punish him, and boy keeps running and climbs over the rock near the Kaveri bank. Vibhishana finally reaches the boy and hits him on the fore-head. One can see a pit in the forehead of the idol even today.The little boy then reveals himself to be Vinayaka . Vibishana immediately apologizes and the Lord gives him his blessings, reveals that the idol is destined to remain in Srirangam and sends him off to Lanka. This is similar in many regards to the story Of Lord Ganesha in Gokarna with Ravana in the same Ramayana period..
The place in which the Ranganathan deity was kept was later covered in deep forests, due to disuse and after a very long time, it was discovered when a Chola king chasing a parrot found the deity accidentally. He then established the Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam as the largest temple complexes in the world. Meanwhile, the Pallavas built the Vinayaka temple and the Thayumanaswamy temple, in the rock which Vinayaka used to escape Vibishana.
Uchi Pillayar is always associated with Manicka Vinayagar at the foothills. It is a general worship practise to pray obesiance with Manicak Vinayagar before visiting Uchi Pillayar.

Tirugnanasambandar converting Male Palm Tree to Female Palm Tree:
Many years back there was often flood in the river. Due to that the walls of the temple were get damaged. To avoid this damage one devotee of this temple raised the banks and planted Palm Trees (பனை மரம்). All the trees were male tree and not a single female tree. There were no fruits (நொங்கு) from the trees.  On seeing this few Jains started mocking at the Siva devotee and telling them that this is the power of lord Siva. They challenged let lord Siva change these trees to female and get the fruits. Only then we believe in Siva. The worried devotee mentioned this to the visiting Tirugnanasambandar about this.
Tirugnanasambandar sung a Thevara Pathigam and in the end of the Pathigam he sung “குரும்பை ஆண்பனை ஈன்குலை ஓத்தூர்”. Immediately with the grace of Lord Vedapuriswarar all the male trees were transformed in to female trees and yielded the fruits. On seeing this all Jains in that area converted to Saivism. Even today we can see the stone palm tree in front of Ambal Sannithi. Poojas are conducted for this tree.
Story behind Nandhi facing outside:
The Nandhi in this temple will not be looking towards Sannadhi. It will be facing outside. As Siva teaching Vadam to all the Devas and Rishis, he had instructed the Nandhi not to allow anyone except Devas and Rishis. Due to this reason Nandhi is facing outside.
Another Story behind Nandhi facing outside:
The King Thondaman had very strong faith on Vedapuriswarar. Once he was defeated by another king Visuvavasu. Thondaman lost his confident and prayed Lord Vedapuriswarar. The Lord gave lot of strength by providing his support and instructed Nandikeswarar to help Thondaman to win the war. To go with Thondaman Nandhi was looking outside.
Parvathi made Cheyyar River with her Trisula:
Legend says that Goddess Parvathi (Balakusalambigai or Ilamulainayagi) made a line on the earth’s surface with her Trisula to make a river for her son, Lord Muruga to play.
Etymology:
The temple was where Shiva preached Vedas to the Devas hence the name Vedapureeshwarar and the place was called Thiru vedapuram or Thiru odhu Puram in Tamil now corrupted to thiruvettipuram.
It is located at a distance of about 33 Kms from Kancheepuram, 33 kms from Arani, 33 kms from Arcot, 34 kms from Vandavasi.

Original Source: https://tamilnadu-favtourism.blogspot.com/2016/09/kandhaswamy-temple-cheyyur-kanchipuram.html
Kandhaswamy Temple is dedicated to Hindu God Muruga located in Cheyyur in Kanchipuram district in the South Indian state of Tamilnadu. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple was constructed during the Cholas during the 10th century. Muruga is worshipped as Kandhaswamy along with his consorts Valli and Deivasena. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines.
The place is about 25 kms south of Maduranthagm. In Olden days this town was known as Jayamkonda Chola Nallur and Virarajendra Nallur. As per epigraphical evidences, it belonged to Jayamkonda Chola Mandalathu Chembur Kotta Puraiyur. This town was also called Seioorm, Seigaiyampathy and Valavapuri.  In this place there is a temple for Lord Siva Known as Puttridang Kondaar Temple and Kariya Mannikakam Perumal Temple.
Arunagiri Nathar has revered the temple in his verses in Tirupugal. There are idols of 27 Vedhalams (Bhootganas/ghosts) representing 27 stars found in the temple and it is unique which cannot be found anywhere else. Lord Brahma and Vishnu are standing as Dwarapalakas of Lord Shiva. The goshta images of Subramanya are unique the dancing Skanda, Skanda carrying bow and arrow, etc.
The temple is open from 6 am – 12:30 pm and 4:30 – 8:00 pm on all days. Four daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Vaikasi Visagam, Kanthasashti festival, Surasamharam, Thaipoosam festival and Panguni Uthiram festival being the most prominent being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamilnadu.
Morning: 7 am to 11 am – Pooja at 9 am
Evening: 6.30 pm to 8.30 pm (on Astami days after full moon from 5 pm to 9 pm)
Kandhaswamy temple has a flat Rajagopuram in the North, piercing the rectangular granite walls around the temple. Road construction over the years has resulted in swallowing parts of the idols in the multiple pillars that stand in front of the temple. There are two entrances to the temple. One is through the South facing main entrance. There is an entrance through the East through which also one can reach the inner prakaram and the Artha Mandapa.
The presiding deity Kandhaswamy is housed in the East facing sanctum, with Valli and Deivasena on either of his sides. Kandhaswamy is flanked by the Dwarapalakas, Suveeran and Sujanan on either side. The sanctum is approached from the main entrance through the flag staff hall, Maha Mandapam and Artha Mandapam. There is 5 ft. (1.5 m) granite Vel in front of Kandhaswamy. The flag staff is located in the flagstaff hall axial to the sanctum. An image of peacock, the vehicle of Muruga and Surya faces the main shrine in the Maha Mandapam.
On entering the temple, one can find the Somanathar, Meenakshiammai Shrine to the left of the front Mandapam. There are shrines of Vinayaga before the Mahamandapam and the sanctum is guarded by Brahma and Vishnu, which is an unusual feature in Murugan temples. Nandi is found in front of the shrine. The shrine of Thiripurasundari is located in the second precinct. There are separate shrines of Valli and Deivasena in South facing shrines diagonally opposite to the sanctum.
The image of Somanathar and Meenakshi are in the temple. The images of the 27 Bhutaganas, each 2 ft. (0.61 m) tall are sculpted in the niches around the sanctum. The first precinct around the sanctum houses the images of Nrithuya Kanthar, Bala Kanthar, Brahma Sastha, Sivagurunathar, Veduvar and Navagrahas. A unique feature of this temple is that all Goshta Devathas are different forms of Subramanya.
Usually in Saivaite temples one can see Vinayaka, Dakshinamoorthy, Lingothbhavar or Vishnu, Brahma, Chandikeshwarar, Durga, Bhairava, and Surya are seen as Goshta Devathas. But in this temple, one can see that there is Nrittaskanda instead of Vinayaka, Brahmasasta instead of Dakshinamoorthy, Bala Skanda instead of Vishnu, Sivagurunatha instead of Brahma and Pulindhar (Lord Muruga in the form of a hunter) instead of Durga.
Moreover, Chandikeshwarar and Bhairava who are normally found in Shiva temples are found here in their usual places. The Surya in this temple is called Guha Surya. Apart from these forms of Muruga, there is also an Arumugha Swamy facing the Southern entrance. On the outer Prahara, as we circumambulate, we can find Ganesha shrine and a Nandavanam to the North of the Sanctum Sanctorum.  The Sthala Vrikshams of this temple are Vanni and Karungali.
To the North of the Dwajasthambam, is the Amman shrine and there is a Sarva Vadya Mandapam in front of it. Till the year 1947, all kinds of musical instruments were played and dance recitals conducted during festivals in this mandapam.  Behind the Dwajasthambam, there is a separate Shrine for Navagrahas.
Periyandavar Puja is also observed at this temple. Outside the temple, on the Navasandhis, there are nine Vinayakas said to have been worshipped by the Navagrahas. These also add to the uniqueness of the temple. To the West of the temple, is a tank called Chettikulam. Chetty is one of the names by which Lord Muruga is known. This tank belongs to the temple. The pillars outside the main entrance of the temple also have few intricate Sculptures. There are several beautiful sculpture panels found at the outside of the temple wall.
The temple follows Saivite tradition. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasanthi at 7:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:30 p.m., and Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m. During the Arthajamam between 8:30 – 9:00 p.m, Kandhaswamy is believed to offer his worship Somanatha along with the 27 Bhoothaganas and it is enacted every day. Each ritual has three steps: Alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) & Deeparadhanai (waving of lamps) for both Kandhaswamy and Thiripurasundari. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 6 am – 12:30 pm and 4-9:00 pm on all days.
The temple has many festivals in its calendar, with the Vaikasi Visagam, Aadi Krithigai, Kanthasashti, Surasamharam, Karthigai Deepam, Thaipoosam and Panguni Uthiram are the festivals being the being the most prominent. Sarva vadyam is a music instrument used in the temple from historic times during the festive occasions. Chengalvaraya Sastri, a historical musician is believed to have composed songs praising the presiding deity. The practise of singing his songs during the rituals is continued in modern times. During Kandha Sashti, the Vel Vaangum Vizha is celebrated behind the Mahodhara Bootha Vethalam belonging to Pooradam star.
As per Hindu legend, Muruga obtained the Vel (spear) from his mother Parvathi from Sikkal Singaravelan Temple. He slayed Sooran, the demon, the event called Surasamharam at Thiruchendur. During the war, Bhutaganas, Shiva’s army, is also believed to have helped Murugan. Since Murugan killed Sooran and his son Iranyeswaran, he attained Dosha (sin).
To propitiate himself from the sin, he is believed to have installed the image of Shiva as Somanatha at this place and worshipped Shiva. Since the son of Shiva (called Sei) worshipped him, the place is called Cheyyur. The 27 Bhutaganas are personified to the 27 stars as per Hindu mythology.

Tiruppukkozhiyur (also called Karunaiyaaththaal Temple, Avinasilingeswarar temple and Avinasiappar temple) is a Hindu temple dedicated to the deity Shiva, located in Avinasi, a panchayat town in Coimbatore district in the South Indian state of Tamilnadu. Shiva is worshipped as Avinasiappar, and is represented by the lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Karunambigai. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam.
The temple complex covers five acres and it houses two gateway towers known as gopurams, each facing the Avinasiappar and Karunambigai shrine. The temple has a number of shrines, with those of Avinasiappar and his consort Karunambigai being the most prominent. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 6:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and four yearly festivals on its calendar. The Brahmotsavam festival is celebrated during the day of the Magam (February – March) is the most prominent festival.
The original complex is believed to have been built by Cholas, while the present masonry structure was built during the Nayak during the 16th century. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamilnadu. The Avinashi temple is believed to be the first among the seven shivastalams of Kongunadu. Avinashi is part of the ancient Kongunadu which now comprises the districts of Coimbatore, Salam, Dharmapuri, Karur and Palani. Avinashi temple is located on the Chennai Cochin NH47 highways.
The Tamil saying goes – Kasiyil Vasi Avinashi meaning that what the devotee derives by worshipping in Kasi-Varanasi, he/she derives half of the benefits by worshipping Avinashilingeswara in Avinashi. Lord Avinashi Appar, Lord Bhairava and the holy water-Theertham- are brought from Kasi. Bathing in the Kasi well in the temple on new moon day-Amavasya brings manifold benefits to the devotee. There will be no interval closing of the temple on new moon days. Vinasam in Sanskrit or Tamil means perishable. Avinashi means imperishable.

It is believed that those waiting for a child should bathe in the holy spring, worship the Saptha Kannikas for the purpose. Those having rashes or scars in the face (called Maru in Tamil) are advised to bathe in Thoni River and put salt and pepper in the river. Women seeking child boon are advised to sit on a stone called Varadikal with a coconut and fruits and should pray with a determined mind.
During the prayer, if they unknowingly touch the coconut and the fruits, they are sure to achieve the boon. Also unmarried youth seeking higher education, jobs, and peace of mind pray here with fruits and coconut to the Lords. The temple is famous for the sandal paste worship. It is believed that if the devotees throw the sandal balls on the Lord, and if that ball sticks on the forehead of the Lord, their prayers would be fulfilled.
According to Hindu mythology, Atri Maharishi along with his wife Anusuya Devi lived here. Sage Narada was moved by the Anusuya’s Devotion to husband and he praised her a lot before the wives of Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva which made them envious of her. They requested their husbands to reduce her devotion to husband. Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva went to Anusuya as guests when Atri Maharishi was not there at home. They asked her to serve them food.
When she agreed to do so, they said that they will accept her alms on the condition that she serves them without wearing clothes. Anusuya falls into a quandary. If she comes without clothes in front of other men her devotion to husband will be reduced. If she refuses then that will be a disgrace to the guests and they can take away all the power of Atri. Anusuya felt that the three guests who asked such a strange favour are not common people since they are trying to place her in a fiddly situation.
Anusuya prayed to her husband in her mind and said that she doesn’t have any fear serving them without clothes as she is not affected by desire. When she heard the guests asking for alms saying Oh Mother! Give us some food where they called her a mother, she decided to consider them as her children and serve them as requested. Because of her greatness and as per her thoughts by the time she came to serve food the three gods became small children and her breasts started producing milk. She then breastfed them and put them to sleep in a cradle.
Atri came back afterwards and hearing the story from Anusuya praised the three gods sleeping in the cradle. They woke up in their original form and praised Anusuya’s devotion to husband and gave her a boon. Anusuya requested that these three should be born as her children—the incarnation of Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma as sage Durvasa, Dattatreya and the moon-god Chandra. The Thiru Moorthi’s blessed the couple and hence the place is known as Thiru Moorthi hills.
Of the many places sacredly attached to Lord, Tirumuthi hills occupy a significant place, because, it is believed that Lord graces here invisibly as a child.  He imparts all boons the devotee asks for.  Tirumurthimalai is also the place indicated by Lord Shiva to Sage Agasthya to have his Kailash wedding darshan.  The place is also revered as Panchalinga Sthala, hence praised as Kailash of South.
It is situated 50 Kms from Pollachi and 23 kms from Udumalpet on the highway from Palani to Coimbatore. Panchalingas are at a height of 900 meters from the foot hill. Bus facilities are conveniently available from Udumalpet and Dharapuram via Dhali. Nearest Railway Station is located at Udumalpet and Nearest Airport is located at Coimbatore.

There is epigraphic evidence to show that Raja Parameswara Pallava performed Samprokshanam for this temple. The age of the temple is said to be around 1200 years old. The temple is situated in 2 acres with 65 feet Rajagopuram. There are separate Sannathis for Perumal, Thayar and Anjaneya Swamy. The Moolavar Narasimhar is 7 ft. height and 5 ft. breadth, the Uthsavar is known as Soundarya Varadhar. Thayar is also 5 ft. height with 3 ft. breadth. The Thayar is called Soundaravalli Thayar.
The Kanchi Varadarajar temple is a famous and well known temple and Pallava kings have taken great care of this temple and this temple had glorious time during their kingdom. However during the Mughal invasion there was a great threat to the temples and Kanchi Varadarajar was taken to this temple at Sevilimedu village in the banks of Palar. There was a beautiful Sri Lakshmi Narasimha temple at this village. Varadaraja Perumal was kept here for one year and his Utsavams were performed here.
The archa-Vigrahas were taken to this temple from original Varadaraja temple through a tunnel which can be even seen today. In order to remind of this incident even today Sri Varada visits this temple during Chitra Pournami day. Another interesting note is that the famous well from which Sri Ramanuja used to offer water to Sri Varada is situated near to this temple. The Well is called Salakkinaru meaning the Well near the road.
There is another interesting place near Sevilimedu. This place is called Nadavavi Kinaru. This is a big well-constructed during Pallava Period. In those days this is used for irrigation purpose. Beneath the water there is a Mandapam. During Chitra Pournami the water will be drained out. There are steps to get in to the Mandapam. On the night of Chitra Pournami, Sevilimedu Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy gives darshan to all astikas in this mandapam. This place is 6 kms away from Sevilimedu.
The temple and the main sanctum face east. The main deity, Sri Lakshmi Narasimha, is in a seated pose with Goddess Lakshmi on his left lap. His upper hands hold the conch and discus, while his lower right hand is in the attitude of reassuring his devotees that he will protect them and his left hand encircles Goddess Lakshmi. The processional deity of this temple is known as Sri Soundarya Varadar.
In front of this main sanctum is a large mandapam with many pillars, datable to the 15th – 16thcentury A.D., of the era of the Vijayanagara kings which are studded with numerous sculptures. To the side of this mandapam is a small sanctum with stone images of Sri Vishvaksena, Ananta, Vaikunthavasa, Poigai Azhwar, Nammazhwar, Ramanuja and Vedanta Desika. Leading from this mandapam is another one hall of a similar type, but much larger and more ornate.
In this pillared hall is a shrine for a large stone image of Garuda in Anjali hasta, facing Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Perumal. In the same mandapam, is another small sanctum for Sri Bhakta Anjaneya facing south. Situated in the vast prakara, to the right of the main sanctum and facing east, is the shrine for Goddess Lakshmi, worshipped in this temple as Sri Soundarya valli Thayar. This temple, which was in a dilapidated condition, has been renovated. Although many parts of the temple have been much modernized, vestiges of the art and architecture of the bygone eras are still seen here, especially the architectural expansion which took place in the Vijayanagara times.
In 2011, the Maha Samprokshanam of this temple took place and in 2008 the Rajagopuram Samprokshanam was conducted. A few festivals are celebrated in this temple which follows the codes of the Vaikhanasa Agama. During every Swati nakshatram, Thirumanjanam takes place for Sri Lakshmi Narasimha. Fridays in the month of Thai are important for Thayar here. In the month of Chittirai, Sri Varadaraja Swami from the famous temple of Kanchipuram visits this temple and goes around the village and then goes to the nearby historic village of Ayyangarkulam where there is a large temple for Sri Anjaneya.

Ona Kantheeswarar Temple (also called Onakanthali) is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva, located in the town of Panjupettai, Kanchipuram, Kanchipuram district in Tamilnadu, India. Shiva is worshipped as Ona Kantheeswarar and his consort Parvathi as Kamakshi. Ona Kantheeswarar is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, the 275 temples revered in the canon.
The temple has a small three-tiered Rajagopuram, the entrance tower and all the shrines are located in an elevated structure. The temple has two daily rituals at various times from 5:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., and three yearly festivals on its calendar, namely the Margazhi Thiruvathirai during the Tamil month of Margazhi (December – January) and Aippasi full moon day Aippasi (October – November) being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamilnadu.
The temple is located 1 km (0.62 mi) south-west of Ekambareswarar Temple in Kanchipuram in a locality called Panjupettai. Ona Kantheeswarar temple complex has a single prakarams (outer courtyard) covering an area of 80 m2 (860 sq. ft.) and a small three-tiered Rajagopuram (gateway tower) facing East. The central shrine faces east and holds the two image of Ona Kantheeswarar (Shiva) in the form of lingam made of granite and is believed to be a swayambumurthy (self-manifested). There are two other shrines of Shiva namely Salantheeswarar and Jalandeeswarar.
As in other temples in Kanchipuram, there is no separate shrine of Parvathi as it is believed that Kamakshi of Kanchipuram is the common Parvathi shrine for all Shiva temples. There is a separate shrine for Vinayagar called Vaiyurunthi Pillayar. The granite images of Nandi (the bull and vehicle of Shiva), a tall flag staff and a Balipeeta, the place of offering, axial to the sanctum.
As in other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the first precinct or the walls around the sanctum of Ona Kantheeswarar have images of Dakshinamurthy (Shiva as the Teacher), Durga (warrior-goddess) and Chandikeswarar (a saint and devotee of Shiva). The temple precinct is surrounded by granite walls. There is a Vinayagar deity at the Thiruvonakandan mandapam at the entrance and if you put your ear, you will get a kind of omkhara sound. Theertham is Onakandhan Teertham.
The temple is open from 7.00 a.m. to 7.00 p.m. continuously.
Devotees believe that chanting a song of Saint Sundarar would bring them prosperity. Performing special abisheks to Lord and Mother, devotees contribute what they can for the maintenance of the temple.
As per Hindu legend, the temple was believed to have been built by two asuras (demons) named Onan and Kanthan. The asuras got a lingam (an iconic representation of Shiva) from a forest in the region and became ardent devotees. On account of their devotion, they got all the desired boons. There was a third Asura, Jalandeeswaran, who joined the two, and became an ardent devotee of Shiva. The three shrines in the temple, each dedicated to Onakantheeswarar, Salantheeswarar and Jalandeeswarar are believed to be the respective shrines built by the demons.
Sundarar, a 7th-century Tamil Saivite poet, venerated Ona Kantheeswarar in one verse in Tevaram, compiled as the Seventh Thirumurai. As the temple is revered in Tevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 275 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon. It is believed that he got back one of his eyes which he lost on account of not keeping his word in the Ekambaranathar Temple. To test his devotion, Shiva moved toward a tamarind tree and Sundarar followed his footsteps and sung praises of Shiva. His devotion was admired and Shiva turned the tamarind leaves to golden leaves and poured on him from the skies.
The Temple is located at about a km to the West of the Ekambareswarar temple near the Sarvatheertham in a corner of the road that leads to Arakkonam, just opposite to the Panjupettai Electricity Board sub-station. Nearest Railway Station is located at Kanchipuram and Nearest Airport is located at Chennai.

When Sundarar visited this place Shiva appeared before him in the form of an old man and offered food. Sundarar laughed at him and said when there is no water what is the use of food.

Story behind the name Kutram Porutha Naathar:
Meganaathan was the son of Ravana.  Since he won Lord Indra in the war, he was known as ‘Indrajit’. Once, Indrajit was flying in his Pushpaka vimanam across the sky. Suddenly the flight of the vimanam was impeded. When he looked down he understood that he was flying over Siva’s temple and so this impediment had happened to him. Indrajit was sad and he worshipped the deity of this place after taking bath in the sacred theertham.
He also tried to shift this wonderful Lingam to Lankapuri. But he could not and fell unconscious in the process. Ravana came to know about this incident. He surrendered to the Lord’s feet, pleaded to him to pardon his son and bestow blessings on him. The kind Lord did so. Hence, the deity of this sacred place is called ‘Kutram Porutha Naathar’.
Another version of the story behind the name Kutram Porutha Naathar:
According to the legend, Indiran, the king of Devas, is said to have attacked Shiva with his Vajrayutham and Shiva is said to have forgiven him for his hasty act of aggression. Hence Lord Shiva is known here as Aparadha Kshameswarar in Sanskrit and is referred as Kutram Porutha Nathar in Tamil.
King Vichitraangan blessed with Children by praying here:
King Vichitraangan with his wife Suseelai came to this place and worshipped to beget issues. He was blessed with a child and the happy King erected this beautiful temple – so says history.
Surya worshipped Shiva here:
Since Sun god worshipped in this place, this place came to be known as ‘Thalaignaayiru’.
Brahma informed Vasishta about the importance of this Temple:

Karuppariyalur:
Those who come and worship here will not be in the mother’s womb in the next janma are the belief.  That is, they will not be born again. The traditional belief is that they will reach the feet of Lord Siva.  Hence, this holy place is called ‘Karuppariyalur’.
Relief of Hanuman’s dosham or curse:  
Lord Rama, in order to be relieved off the dosham of killing Ravana during the war, wanted to perform Siva pooja. He asked Hanuman to bring a Sivalingam in a few hours time. Hanuman accepted the command and went towards the northern side. Since he did not return within the stipulated time, Lord Rama created a Lingam in the sand, installed it and worshipped. Where Lord Rama performed pooja to Lord Siva became ‘Rameswaram’.
Hanuman was sad to know that the Lingam was installed before he returned. And he also pulled that Lingam by binding it with his tail, but could not do so. Because of his action, Hanuman was penalized. Lord Rama advised him that if he performed tapasya to Lord Siva, he would get rid of the penalty.
Accordingly, Hanuman did tapasya and Lord Siva appeared before him and said: “Hanuman! You go to Kanmapuram also called Thalaignaayiru and worship. You will be relieved of this curse.” Thus the Lord graced him. Hanuman, as directed by the Lord, came to Thalaignaayiru, worshipped the deity and got free of his curse. Surprised at the immense benevolence of Lord Siva, he installed a Lingam in his own name at the North-eastern part of this sacred place and began worshipping it. Now, this place is known as ‘Thirukkurakkaa’.

Emperor Muchukunda got seven Lingas from Indira for the helps he had rendered him. These Lingas were small – Vidanga in size. The Emperor installed the Linga in Seven Places called Saptha Vidanga sthalas. This is one such Sthalas with a Linga so beautiful made of Ruby. Hence, the Lord is named Sundara (beautiful) Vidangar.
Irattai Parvai Nandhi:
As Ambica is a virgin, Lord sent Nandhi Deva to be her guard. But Nandhi expressed his wish to be with Lord for ever seeing him. Lord said that he can have his darshan though with Ambica. Nandhi in the temple is seen with its neck turned towards Lord with one eye on Ambica and other on the Lord. Hence, the Nandhi is known as Twin View Nandhi (Irattai Parvai in Tamil). Those having vision problems pray to this Nandhi.
Rare Custom of placing Garlands and Clothes used for Lord to corpse:
Generally, temples are closed if a death occurs in a nearby place.  In this place, the garlands and the clothes – vastras used for the Lord is placed on corpse. A fisherman, Adhipathar attained salvation with the grace of Lord Shiva in this place. Remembering this event, as a mark of respect to the community, this practice is followed in this temple. The body is placed before the temple without closing the doors. The garland and the vastras used for the Lord are placed on the body.
Lord procession to seven places instead of going around Mada Veedhis:
During festival procession, Lord goes round the Mada Veedhis (Streets) and return to the temple.  But Lord beginning his procession from this temple, goes to seven places – Poigainallur, Poravacherry, Sikkal, Palur, Vadagudi, Thethi and Nagoor. Maharaja Salija worshipped Lord Shiva and performed puja in these seven places. The present system is to remember this history.
Vishnu accompanies Shiva during Pradosham:
Against the practice of Lord coming in the Vrushab vahanam on Pradosham days, Lord Vishnu too accompanies Lord Shiva in the guise of Mohini. When the milk ocean was churned, Nectar came out and was served by Lord Vishnu to Devas. Devas failed to pray to Lord Shiva who swallowed the Halahala poison to save the world. Realizing their folly, they begged the pardon of the Lord. Showing his mercy to them, Lord Shiva danced on Nandhi. This dance took place at the Pradosham time. Lord Vishnu’s Mohini Avatar took place a little before this time. This Vishnu darshan is available to the devotees on Pradosham day only.
Navagrahas facing West – the Lord:
Emperor Dasaratha came to know that Planet Saturn would be splitting the Rohini star causing severe famine in his country. He planned to fight Saturn to prevent him from doing so. Sun God advised Dasaratha to drop his plan but to beg Saturn to change his transit route in public interest. Saturn also admired the earlier plan of the emperor to meet him in war for the sake of his subjects without any selfish motive personally. The planet yielded to the emperor’s wish. Remembering this event, all the planets (Navagrahas) in the temple are facing west-the Lord.
Athipathar attained salvation here:
Fisherman Athipathar was a staunch Shiva devotee. When he went for fishing, he would offer the first to Lord Shiva. At a stage, he was getting only one fish each day but did not break away from his commitment. He offered them to Lord and returned without any catch. He got a golden fish one day. Though everyone prevented him from throwing it into the sea, Athipathar resolutely stood by his commitment and threw it into the sea.
He was awarded with salvation and a place among the 63 Nayanmars. The event is celebrated on the Ayilyam star day in Aavani month (August-September). Athipathar goes in catamaran when fishermen place two gold fishes in the net as if caught in the net. Lord Shiva will appear on the sea shore. Athipathar performs pujas to Lord Shiva with the golden fishes. Shiva will grace darshan to Athipathar. So goes the festival grandly.
Azhuguni Chithar:
As a child adamantly demanding the mother to get its wish, there was a Siddha in the place called Azhuguni Chithar – crying adamantly for a wish. He used to cry in the shrine of Mother Neelayadakshi demanding salvation. He was the disciple of Gorakka Siddha. He stayed in the temple, cried for getting his demand. Mother spoke to Lord Shiva of the issue. Lord granted salvation to Azhuguni Chithar. His Jeeva Samadhi is in this temple. Special pujas are performed to Siddha on Vaikasi Visakam day. Also special pujas are performed here offering porridge (Payasam in Tamil) as nivedhana on Poornima – full moon – days.
Praised in Thevaram Hymns:
The temple is greatly praised by the three celebrated saints Sambandar, Appar and Sundarar in their Thevaram hymns. Sundarar received gifts of pearl and diamond chains, a horse and cosmetic things.
Sages worshipped Lord here:
Sages Markandeya, Gauthama, Vasishta, Kashyapa, Pulasthya, Agasthya and Angirasa (Saptha Rishis) had worshipped Lord Shiva in this temple.

Hearing that Vedas, the holy scriptures of land themselves worshipped the Lord here, Gnanasambandar requested Tirunavukkarasar – Appar to sing a hymn on Lord to open the doors. Appar, tears flowing from his eyes sang ten verses beginning with line “Pannin Ner Moshiyal” and begged Lord to open the doors of the temple. Excited by the graceful response of the Lord, both entered the temple through the main entrance and worshipped Lord. While coming out, Appar wished Gnanasambandar to sing a hymn so that doors could be opened and closed for the worship of the devotees as in all temples.
Child saint Sambandar sang a Pathigam – 10 verses – beginning with the line “Chathuram Marai” closing the door. Since then, main doors of temple began to function in usual manner as in other temples.

Vishnu appearing in eleven forms on Shiva request:
The legends of all the eleven temples of Thirunangur are closely associated with each other. As per legend, the Hindu god Shiva started dancing in fury at this place after the death of his consort Uma due to the yagna (sacrifice) of Daksha. Each time his lock of hair touched the ground; there were eleven other forms of Shiva who appeared. The celestial deities were worried that if the dance continues, it would result in decimation of entire creations. They prayed to Vishnu for help, who appeared at this place.
On seeing Vishnu, Shiva’s anger was reduced and he requested Vishnu to appear in eleven forms like he did. On his request, Vishnu appeared in eleven different forms at Thirunangur. Arimeya Vinnagaram literally translates to the place where Hari (another name of Vishnu) resides.
The eleven places where Vishnu appeared are believed to be where the eleven temples in Thirunangur are located. They are;
Govardhana descended here on request of Shiva:
There is another local legend that Govardhana (Vishnu) descended here at the request of Shiva.
Arimeya Vinnagaram: 
This place was selected by Perumal (Hari) Himself to reside and that’s the reason for the name of the place. Also, “Ari” means one who makes the sins to vanish. As the Lord of this place vanishes our sins, this place is called as Arimeya Vinnagaram.
Kuda Maadu Koothan:
Lord Shiva is well known for His dances. Lord Vishnu too demonstrates here as a good dancer by performing the “Kuda Koothu” dance and got His name as Kuda Maadu Koothan. Kuda Koothu is one type of Koothu (dance) in which the hero stands still and bring out expression as a light kept inside a pot. Lord Krishna performed this Koothu here to explain his Aadhi Moola Naraya Thathuvam i.e., the reason behind the birth of everything in this world.
Sage Uthanga arrival to Thiru Arimeya Vinnagaram:
Uthanga Maharishi got married to Prabhai and once a Crocodile took her away when both were taking holy bath in river Ganges. Uthanga Maharishi got vexed and roamed in many places and finally came to Thiru Arimeya Vinnagaram. Here Kuda Maadu Koothan gave Dharsan as Krishna to him and said that his wife has attained Mukthi (eternity) and thus got him out of his sorrow.
Vishnu made Uthanga to realize his mistake:
Sage Uthanga was a great devotee of the Supreme Lord and a learned brahmana. He was called Vipra Rishi. Vipra Rishis are very learned and wise Vedic scholars and are mostly brahmanas. There is an interesting pastime of Uthanga Rishi, which is elaborately described in the Vayu Purana. Sage Uthanga was a very pious, who performed penance for the welfare of mankind. He was a regular visitor to Dwaraka and Krishna was very dear to him. Krishna had a special affection towards him. After all Krishna is gau brahmana hita, the protector of the cows and brahmanas. In those times, brahmanas were very pious and strict in executing their duties.
Sage Uthanga used to wander in secluded areas and had no fixed residence. He was an avadhuta and stitapragnya. He had no desire, no lust, no hatred, and no greed. He was absorbed and fixed in another realm- pure devotional service of Krishna. Lord Krishna was very happy with the sage’s penances and prayers. He showed the sage His universal form or virata rupa and granted him any boon. Sage Uthanga told Krishna that he desired to see the universal form of the Lord and he just prayed to Krishna with trembling hands; he had no interest in petty material boons. But Lord Krishna insisted that the sage ask for some boon to be granted to him as a reward for his penance. As Lord Krishna insisted, the latter asked for a boon that whenever he was in need of water and whenever he felt thirsty, water may be provided to him.
Lord Krishna granted him the boon and disappeared. Sage Uthanga knew that in Bhagavad- Gita Krishna says, “I am the taste of water.” In short, Sage Uthanga asked for Krishna Himself. For pure devotees, everything is connected with Krishna. One day, after Sage Uthanga walked for a long distance in the desert area, he felt thirsty, but there was no trace of water. Then he remembered that Lord Krishna had granted him a boon that he would find water. As the sage recalled this, he saw a hunter dressed in torn rags accompanied by furious dogs, carrying water in a leather pouch. The hunter asked him, “Oh sage, would you like to drink some water?” Looking at the apparent condition of the hunter and being a staunch brahmana, the sage felt repelled. He politely refused.
The hunter again approached him to drink the water, but in utter disgust and anger the sage told the hunter to go way and that he was not interested in the water. The hunter and the dogs disappeared. Witnessing this, the sage realized that the hunter may have been Krishna Himself in disguise, come to quench the sage’s thirst. He felt hurt at how Lord Krishna had sent water to him through a chandala. How could He expect a brahmana to accept and drink water from the leather pouch?
Meantime, Lord Krishna appeared, smiled and asked him, “Who was the chandala?” Krishna had asked Indra deva to fetch the water. But instead of water, Indra had actually brought nectar that makes one immortal, but only on condition that one can see the Divinity in all. Sage Uthanga understood the meaning of it and begged pardon. He insisted that he did not desire for immortality and would only be interested in serving Lord Krishna as long as he lived.
Lord Vishnu gave darshan to Sage Uthanga:
Legend has it that Sage Uthanga learned the Vedas during his childhood from Sage Vaidhya. It was a practice that when a student left the hermitage of his guru after completing his studies, he would make some dakshina or offering to the lotus feet of the guru. Thus the child Uthanga asked his guru what he would like to have as guru dakshina, as it would be wise to offer what the teacher wanted than to offer what the student wanted. The guru Patni (guru’s wife) expressed her desire to have the earrings of the queen whose husband ruled that city. Uthanga approached the Queen with his request to have her earrings to offer as guru dakshina. Kings always fulfilled the desires of the brahmanas. So the Queen offered him the earrings without any hesitation; she had already heard about Uthanga’s truthfulness.
Uthanga happily returned to the hermitage of the guru. On his way back he was fatigued with hunger and thirst, so he decided to rest for a while. Immediately there appeared an attractive cowherd with a mud pot on his head and a bamboo stick in his hand, dancing to his own tunes, surrounded by his cows. Uthanga solemnly requested the cowherd to give him something to drink from his pot. The cowherd mischievously answered that the pot contained cow dung and urine that was accepted by his guru Vaidhya. Since it is very difficult to get the mahaprasadam of the guru, as soon as Uthanga heard this, without any further thought, he immediately put down his belongings and accepted the contents of the pot.
Suddenly there appeared out of nowhere, a boy who cleverly seized Uthanga’s belongings and slithered off. Uthanga chased the boy, but the boy vanished into a hole in a tree trunk. Uthanga desperately requested the cowherd boy to help him get back his belongings. At once there arrived a man on his horse back. The cowherd boy suggested that Uthanga request the horseman for help and followed Uthanga. Uthanga anxiously approached the rider and explained the whole pathetic state of affairs. The man was deeply moved at by the story and promised to help the boy get back his belongings. He moved in front of the tree trunk hole and forced the horse to sneeze heavily.
Instead of air and mucus, fire and heat came out of the horse’s nose. The boy who was in hiding came out because of the unbearable heat. He returned the belongings of Uthanga and begged for forgiveness. Uthanga expressed his gratitude to the cowherd boy and the horseback rider. He happily returned to the hermitage of his guru. Uthanga narrated all the events to Sage Vaidhya. After listening to Uthanga, Sage Vaidhya replied that the cowherd boy was none other than Lord Vishnu, the horse was Lord Agni and the man on horseback was Lord Indra. They had all come to test Uthanga’s devotion towards his guru.
The cow dung and urine were the divine medicine which helped Uthanga to remain safe and sound. Thus Uthanga’s desire to have darshana of Lord Vishnu in the form of a cowherd boy, Gopala, grew more and more after listening to his guru Sage Vaidhyar. The most compassionate Lord gave darshana as Sri Kudamadukuthan (kudam-adu-kuthan) to Sage Uthanga on this sacred land.  In Tamil kudam means pot, adu means play and kuthan means dance. The Supreme Lord playfully appeared as a dancing boy with pot, known and worshipped here as Kudamadukuthan Perumal. The place has since then been referred to as Harimeya Vinnagaram or the place where Hari danced.

Each time his lock of hair touched the ground; there were eleven other forms of Shiva who appeared. The celestial deities were worried that if the dance continues, it would result in decimation of entire creations. They prayed to Vishnu for help, who appeared at this place.
On seeing Vishnu, Shiva’s anger was reduced and he requested Vishnu to appear in eleven forms like he did. On his request, Vishnu appeared in eleven different forms at Thirunangur. Arimeya Vinnagaram literally translates to the place where Hari (another name of Vishnu) resides.
The eleven places where Vishnu appeared are believed to be where the eleven temples in Thirunangur are located. They are;
Rama gifting a golden idol of cow to a poor Brahmin:
Rama, the seventh avatar of Vishnu came to this place after killing Ravana. He made a golden idol of a cow and gifted to a Brahmin from the ashram of sage Dranethra, from where the place obtained its name. It is believed that Azhagiya Manavalar, the presiding deity at the Azhagiya Manavala Perumal Temple in Trichy came to this place at the request of Shiva. The Brahmin is believed to have built the temple with the gold he obtained and hence it is called Thiruchemponsey (chempon indicated gold in Tamil).
Worshipping Perumal here is equivalent to worshipping Srirangam Ranganathar, Thirupathi Venkatesar and Kanchi Varadhar:
Thirumangai Azhwar had seen Srirangam Ranganathar, Thirupathi Venkatesar and Kanchi Varadhar in this Perumal Himself as mentioned by the Azhwar in his various pasurams about this kshetram, so worshipping this Perumal is considered equivalent to worshipping all these three Perumals at this very same place.
Mukunda getting back all his riches by worshipping Vishnu here:
Once there lived a Brahmin Mukunda, elder son of Kashyapa. He chanted the Ashtakshara Mandiram continuously for 32,000 times here and gained abundant wealth from Perarulalan.
Perarulalan:
As the Lord gives away love and wealth generously to His devotees along with Lord Shiva, He is called as Perarulalan, i.e., a person of generosity. To indicate the never ending generosity of Perarulalan, Lilly flower blooms even during night time (Thaayar has the name of Alli).
Other Names:
This sthalam is called with other names like Hema Rangam, Nagapuri, and Nangai Nagaram.

Thiruvaikunda Vinnagaram or Vaikunta Nathan Perumal Temple is dedicated to Hindu god Vishnu located in Thirunangur, a village in the outskirts of Sirkazhi in the South Indian state of Tamilnadu. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th–9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Vaikuntanathan and his consort Lakshmi as Vaikundavalli.
It is one among the eleven divyadesams of Thirunangur Tirupathis and is closely associated with Thirumangai Alvar. The temple is open from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 7 p.m and has four daily rituals at various times of the day. The Thirumangai Azhwar Mangalasasana Utsavam celebrated annually during the Tamil month of Thai is the major festival of the temple during which the festival images of the eleven Thirunangur Tirupathis are brought on mount designed like Garuda, called Garuda Vahana, to Thirunangur.
This is a place where we could have the direct darshan of Lord in our life time on Earth itself before reaching him after life.  This is his Paramapada itself. The sanctum here is believed to be on par with celestial Vaikuntam. The temple tank is located north of the temple.
The temple is open from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 7 p.m and has four daily rituals at various times of the day.
Devotees pray to Perumal for unity in family. Realizing their wishes, devotees perform Thirumanjanam to Lord and offer Tulsi garlands and Vastras. It is believed that married couples who perform special pooja on star Magam continuously for 6 months are blessed with children.
The temple is open from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamilnadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Ushathkalam at 8 a.m., Kalasanthi at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 7:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: Alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Vaikuntanathan and his consort Vaikundavalli.
During the worship, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. During the new moon day of the Tamil month Thai, the festival deity of Thirumangai Azhwar is brought to the temple from Thiruvali-Thirunagari. Thirumangai Azhwar Mangalasasana Utsavam is celebrated in the Tamil month of Thai (January–February).
The highlight of the festival is Garudasevai, an event in which the festival images of the eleven Thirunangur Tirupathis are brought on mount designed like Garuda, called Garuda Vahana, to Thirunangur. The festive image of Thirumangai Azhwar is also brought on a Hamsa Vahanam (palanquin) and his paasurams (verses) dedicated to each of these eleven temples are recited during the occasion.
The festival images of Thirumangai Alvar and his consort Kumudhavalli Naachiyar are taken in a palanquin to each of the eleven temples. The verses dedicated to each of the eleven temples are chanted in the respective shrines. This is one of the most important festivals in the region which draws thousands of visitors. Vaikunda Ekadasi in December-January and Vaikasi Brahmotsavam in May or June are devotionally celebrated in the temple.
Vishnu appearing in eleven forms on Shiva request:
The legends of all the eleven temples of Thirunangur are closely associated with each other. As per legend, the Hindu god Shiva started dancing in fury at this place after the death of his consort Uma due to the yagna (sacrifice) of Daksha. Each time his lock of hair touched the ground; there were eleven other forms of Shiva who appeared. The celestial deities were worried that if the dance continues, it would result in decimation of entire creations. They prayed to Vishnu for help, who appeared at this place.
On seeing Vishnu, Shiva’s anger was reduced and he requested Vishnu to appear in eleven forms like he did. On his request, Vishnu appeared in eleven different forms at Thirunangur. Arimeya Vinnagaram literally translates to the place where Hari (another name of Vishnu) resides.
The eleven places where Vishnu appeared are believed to be where the eleven temples in Thirunangur are located. They are;
People who worshipped Vishnu here:
Udhanga Maharishi and King Uparisaravasu got the Dharsan of the Lord as he is in Vaigunda Loga. The pious Viraja River which is considered to run across the border of Vaikunda Loga is the theertham here.
Swetakethu had Darshan of Vishnu here:
King Swetakethu belonged to Ikshvaku dynasty which Lord Sri Rama chose for his incarnation. He loved every one and was a living example of honesty and integrity. He and his wife had a passion to visit Vaikunda to have the darshan of Lord Vishnu. As a king, he completed all his political duties and set ready for penance with his queen Damayanthi. They prepared fire around them, stood looking at the Sun and began a severe penance. Days passed. They shed their mortal coil and reached Vaikundam but could not find their Vaikunda Vasan. They stood sad. Maharshi came there.
Swetakethu and Damayanthi fell at his feet and enquired him why they could not get the darshan of Lord.  Narada replied that though they performed severe penance but failed to perform even small Homas and charities. That failure was the cause of this failure. The remedy was that they had to worship Lord Iravadeswarar on the banks of Cauvery on Earth and appeal to him, who would help them to have Vaikunda darshan. Both prayed to Lord Iravadeswarar and begged his help for Perumal darshan.
Lord Iravadeswarar appeared before them and said that he too was waiting for Perumal darshan and suggested that they could join him in penance. Meantime, Sage Udhanga Maharshi also joined the in the penance. Thus four performed penance together. When Vishnu appeared before them with Sridevi and Bhoodevi, Lord Iravadeswarar prayed that the place where the darshan was granted should be honoured as Vaikunda Vinnagaram and that he should be worshipped as Vaikunda Nathar. Thus, Perumal came here as Lord Vaikunda Vasan to this place with Mother praised as Vaikundavalli.
This temple is in the village of Thiru Nangur and called as Thiruvaikunda Vinnagaram or Vaikunta Nathan Perumal temple. It’s about 5 miles (8 kms) away from Sirkazhi. It is one among the eleven divyadesams of Thirunangur Tirupathis.

Vishnu blessed Swetharaja with long life:
Swetharaja, the son of Thunthumaran of Surya Vamsa had the life span of only 9 years initially but was later blessed by Lord Srinivasa for a long life, like Markandeya. He visited the temple, bathed in the Swetha pushkarani, started doing Mrutyunjaya Japam under vilva tree and got blessed.

It is believed that Mangai Mannan finally married Kumudhavalli at this place. Hence, there is a separate Sannidhi for Kumudha Valli at this temple.
Thirumangai Azhwar addressing Vishnu as Anna:
Thirumangai Azhvaar came here, had darshan of the Lord and praised him here as if he has seen Lord Srinivasa himself. His Paasurams also reflect the fact that the Lord is the elder brother of Tirupathi Srinivasa. Looked at as the elder brother of Tirupathi Srinivasa, it is believed that those who cannot go to Tirupathi can come here and ‘Annan’ is said to fulfill their wishes.
Lord here is seen together with the Goddess (Alar Mel Mangai) unlike in Tirupathi where he is seen alone. This is the only Divya Desam where the Perumal and Thaayar have the same names as in Tirupathi. All the offering in due to the Thiruvenkatamudayam of Tirupathi can be offered here too. It is also noteworthy that Saint Tirumangai Azhwar addressed only two Perumals as Anna in his hymns, Lord of Tirupathi and this Perumal.

The Vishnu temples at Nangur are a group of 11 temples near Nangur in Nagapattinam district of Tamilnadu, India. The eleven temples are part of the 108 Divya Desams of the Hindu god Vishnu. The temples at Nangur are believed to have been sanctified by Tirumangai Alvar, one of the 12 Azhwars. The oldest of them have been dated to the reign of the Medieval Chola king Parantaka I.
Angered at not being invited for the Yaagam conducted by Parasakthi’s father Dakshan, Shiva is said to have performed the Rudra Thandavam in a place called Ubaya Cauvery (between Cauvery in the South and Mani River in the North), a few kms South East of Sirkazhi. So aggressive was his performance that for every hair that fell down on the ground, a new form of Shiva emerged. And very quickly 11 forms of Shiva were each performing the Rudra Thandavam. Sensing a possible damage to the world as a result of Shiva’s fury, Lord Vishnu appeared here before Shiva as Paramapadha Naathan.
Softened by the presence of Lord Vishnu, Rudra requested Vishnu appears in just as many forms. Lord Vishnu is said to have acceded to this request and provided darshan to Rudra in 11 different forms here in Thiru Nangur, having taken one form each from 11 different Divya Desams. These together constitute the 11 Divya Desams in and around Thiru Nangur.

An idol of Thirumangai Alvar is also brought here on a Hamsa Vahanam (palanquin) and his paasurams (verses) dedicated to each of these 11 temples are recited.
The Utsavar (festival deity) of Thirumangai Alvar and his consort Sri Kumudhavalli Naachiyar are taken in a palanquin to each of the 11 temples, through the paddy fields in the area. The paasurams (poems) dedicated to each of the 11 Divyadesams are chanted in the respective shrines. This is the most important of the festivals in this area, and it draws thousands of visitors.

Lord Brahmma the creator grew proud of his boon of longevity spanning many Yugas. Lord Vishnu decided to teach him a lesson. Sage Romesa performed penance here for the darshan of Lord Vamana-Trivikrama form scaling the whole world with one foot up. Granting his wish, Lord told the sage that he would live longer than Brahmma whose longevity would be reduced by a year if and when one hair fell from his body.
Brahmma understood that Lord has indirectly taught him a lesson and shed his pride. Thus Lord graced this place with his Trivikrama form. This is said to be the place where Lord Vishnu in his Vaamana Avatara measured his first step. At this Divya Desam, only the left foot of the Lord can be seen every day. The right foot is displayed only once a year on the Vaikunta Ekadesi day.
Shangu Pushkarani and Chakra Theertham:
The Sangu which yields Paramapadham and Chakram which gives all wealth lays here as Shangu Pushkarani and Chakra Theertham.
Sri Rama Vinnagaram:
The term Rama is equivalent to number one for he had one wife, one arrow, one word, one rule and one dharma. As the perumal of this place too is the only ruler of the whole world this place is called Sri Rama Vinnagaram.
Etymology:
Thal in Tamil means Earth or World, Aalan means the ruler. As Lord scaled the world with his Foot, Sri Andal called him Thadalan. The verses of Sri Andal are pieces of delight with sweet melody of Tamil coupled with their spiritual content.
Birth place of Saivite Saint Tirugnanasambandar:
Sirkali has the special reputation of being the birth place of Saivite Saint Tirugnanasambandar.
Debate between Thiru Mangai and Thiru Gnana Sambandhar: 
Once the temple was left without proper care, hence an old woman kept the procession deity Thadalan inside the Thavittu (husk) pot. She performed poojas and was worshipping him. After visiting Thiru Chitra Koodam (Chidambaram), Thirumangai Mannan was on his way to Sirkazhi. All the way his subjects sang praise of him uttering different names of Mangai Mannan. The praise of Thirumangai Mannan by his subjects angered the disciples of Thiru Gnana Sambandhar. They blocked Thirumangai Mannan and asked his followers not to shout praises of Thiru Mangai Mannan in this birthplace of Thiru Gnana Sambandhar.
They wanted Thirumangai Mannan to engage with Thiru Gnana Sambandhar in a debate and win over him before continuing with their praise of Thirumangai Mannan. In the dream of Alwar, Lord appeared and told him that to get Thadalan from the old woman, pray to him and after that go for the debate. In the first meeting between Thiru Mangai and Thiru Gnana Sambandhar, the Vaishnavite poet answered fluently each of Thiru Gnana Sambandhar’s questions and let out 10 verses of praise in the name of Vishnu.
Pleased and impressed with Mangai Mannan’s knowledge and the sweetness in his praise and description of the different forms of Vishnu, a spell bound Thiru Gnana Sambandhar acknowledged the greatness of Thirumangai and crowned him as ‘Mangai Azhvaar’. Sambandar was very happy and rewarded Alwar with his Vel which is given by Goddess Parvathi and also an anklet. Both of them hugged each other and bore good bye in a sad mood and paved way to the unity of Saivam and Vaishnavam.
The temple is 2 km from Sirkali bus stand on the Chidambaram route. Frequent buses are available from Chennai, Chidambaram and Kumbakonam. It’s about half mile away from the Sirkazhi station.

As a Shiva devotee, Daksha gained boons from Lord Shiva, which only developed pride in him. He organized a great yajna without inviting Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva withdrew (Parithal in Tamil) the boons granted to him, thus the place came to be known as Tiru Parialur. It is also noteworthy that Daksha was the father of Dhakshayani, consort of Lord Shiva. As he failed in the formalities to be followed in respecting the boon giver, Lord Shiva destroyed him and his yajna. Other invitees like the Devas were also punished for accepting Daksha’s invitation knowing that he had erred in ignoring the Lord. Sun God lost a tooth. He has a shine in the temple worshipping the Lord daily for the wrong he has committed.

Rama disagreeing Sugriva Proposal:
The sea route to Lanka is short from this place. Sugriva planned to build a bridge from here to Lanka to help Rama to cross the sea. But Lord Sri Rama disagreed with the proposal as Kodiakkarai is behind Lanka and that would not be right or graceful to attack Ravana from behind and proceeded to Dhanushkodi being opposite to the front entrance of the island. He worshipped Lord Shiva here before proceeding to Lanka. Remembering this event, the foot prints of Rama is carved here. Lord Shiva in the temple is also praised as Amirtha Kadeswarar.
Lord Shiva directing Rama to build Bridge in Rameshwaram:
Rama is said to have sighted Sri Lanka from here, and what is believed to be his footprint is preserved nearby.

Murugan with Amirtha Kalasam:
When Devas and Asuras churned Thiruppaarkadal for Nectar, many things came out of Ocean and finally they got the Nectar. Vayu Bhagavan was carrying the Nectar pot, Asuras created wind storm. Pot tilted and nectar fell down which formed as Siva Lingam and some Nectar was collected in a pot by Lord Subramanyar. Here we see Subramanyar with Amirta Kalasam. Hence Shiva is called Amritaghateswarar and Theertham as Amrita Theertham.

Lord Shiva feeding Sundarar:
During his pilgrimage, Saivite Saint Sundarar came to this place to worship Shiva, but could not find the temple as the place was a dense jungle then. He sadly continued his journey with his followers. When he felt very hungry, an old man came to him and said that he was feeding Shiva devotees at a nearby place and asked him to come there for a lunch. Sundarar and his followers enjoyed a good feast coupled with hospitality of the host.  After the lunch, Sundarar slept for a while as he was very tired then.
When he woke up, he found neither the feeding camp nor any sign of feeding event. He realized that it was Lord Shiva who quenched his hunger. Lord Shiva appeared before Sundarar and showed him the temple. This Feeding event is celebrated as a great festival on the Full Moon Day of the month of Chithirai (April-May) in the temple. Devotees believe that worshipping the Lord here would ensure them a life free of hunger.
Tirugnana Sambandar prayed to Lord Shiva for absolving his sins for killing Jains:
Tirugnana Sambandar as a child devotee of Lord Shiva and blessed with a high degree of poetic abilities by Mother Parvathi, fought the Jains who waged a war against Saivism. According to the literary history of Tamilnadu, it was Child Sambandar and the ripe old Saivite saint, who had a firsthand knowledge and experience of the Jain designs, fought the war together. In the various challenges Sambandar was drawn, he defeated the Jains and re-established the glory of Saivism in Tamilnadu and almost eliminated Jainism from the Tamil soil.
As was agreed between Sambandar and the Jains, the latter were hanged after Sambandar won every challenge. However, Sambandar had to incur the sin of causing the death of the Jains and wanted to go to Kasi to make amends for the sin. He prayed for the permission of Lord Shiva in Sirkali to proceed to Kasi. Lord appeared before Sambandar and brought Ganga here itself. The child saint had a dip in holy Ganga and got relieved of the sin. A temple was erected here later.
River Ganga sprang in the well here on the New Moon day in the Thai month (January-February). Based on this story, the holy spring is opened for the use of devotees on this day only and will be closed during the rest of the year.

Legend of Bitchadanar:
In the legend of Bitchadanar, once the rishis of Tharukavanam thought penance itself will provide everything and there is no superior God and their ladies were also equally egoistic. Shiva took the form of a beautiful full-nude beggar as Bitchadanar accompanied by Vishnu as Mohini with all their sheen to teach them a lesson. On getting furious over their ladies getting attracted towards this nude beggar, the rishis did different things like creating a snake, tiger, elephant etc., through yagnas, sending mantras and vedas to fight Bitchadanar but nothing could stand in front of him. It is believed that the heroic feat of vanquishing the rogue elephant that came from the Yagna was staged at Vazhuvur and Shiva is being portrayed as Gajasamhara Moorthy in this act. When the elephant approached Shiva, He assumed a miniscule form and jumped into the trunk of the elephant. He then took his Viswaroopa inside the elephant’s body and came out explosively bursting through the stomach of the rogue elephant and wore its skin as a garment. Therefore, this aspect of Shiva is also known as “Kirthivasa” or “one who wears an elephant skin as garment”. Shiva finally revealed his true identity and did a furious dance in front of them. On knowing their mistake, the rishis at once surrendered to Bitchadanar. The rishis learnt hard way that learning all the mantras and vedas are only to promote the human lives and to do good to the society.
Jyestha Devi & Saptha Mathas worshipped Shiva here:
The temple has been visited by Jyeshta Devi and the Sapthamadhas, and the Lingas that they had worshiped can be seen even today.
Shiva saved Vikrama Chola from Sani Bhagavan:
Sani Bhagwan in the temple appears fighting with King Vikrama Raja. Defeated by Sani, the king fell in the Theertha the holy spring. Bathing in the spring, the king worshipped Lord for relief. Sani Bhagwan sought the pardon of Lord. His leg got damaged. There is a separate shrine for Sani in the temple holding a bow.
Etymology:
As the place eluded (Vazhuvudhal in Tamil) destruction by pralaya floods, the place is called Vazhuvur.

The Pallava and Chola rulers constructed many temples in the villages and towns of this area with the Vijayanagara dynasty also subsequently contributing to the architectural development of the temples already existing there. The village of Vallipuram, situated close to the Palar, on its northern bank, might have been a Chaturvedimangalam, or a village of scholars learned in the four Vedas, like many others in the nearby areas.
According to the Manasara, an ancient text in Sanskrit on civil engineering, a village should have a Siva temple on the north-east, a Vishnu temple on the south-west with a tank on true west. The village of Vallipuram has such an arrangement, conforming to the rules laid down in this treatise.
The temple, as well as the central sanctum-sanctorum, faces east. The main stone image of Sri Adikesava Perumal, enshrined here is in a standing posture, wearing a Salagrama garland, holding the conch and discus in his upper left and right hands respectively. His lower right hand is in abhaya hasta and lower left hand is in kati hasta, resting near his hip. His consorts, Sri Devi and Bhu Devi are seen on either side. All the three images are seen on the same pedestal. It is interesting to note that unlike most temples, there is enough space between moola-Vigrahas and the rear wall for a person to circumambulate these images.
The bronze processional image is also worshipped by the name Sri Adikesava Perumal and has the conch and discus in his upper hands and the lower hands are in abhaya hasta and kati hasta just like the main image. He too wears a Salagrama garland. The beauty of the images, both the achala-bhera and the chala-bhera, are truly captivating. On observing closely, one can even see the beautiful long and pointed tips of the nails of the Utsava-vigraha. The other bronze images which are kept here are Chakrattazhvar, Andal and the Snapana Bhera.
This temple is a beautiful specimen of Chola architecture, consisting of a garbha-griha, the antarala (passage between the garbha-griha and the mandapam), the maha-mandapam and the agra-mandapam. In the antarala, the bronze image of Sri Bhakta Anjaneya can be worshipped, along with the icons of Vishvaksena, Nammazhwar and the great Srivaishanva Acharya, Sri Vedanta Desika. The mandapam in front houses the processional image of Ambujavalli Thayar, the consort of Adikesava Perumal as also the stone images of all the Azhwars.
The image of the Bhudattazhwar with his right hand in jnana-mudra resting on this chest is very reminiscent of a similar one worshipped at Mamallapuram, his birthplace, not too far from Vallipuram. Above the central sanctum is the vimana in typical Dravidian style of architecture belonging to the Chola epoch. It contains beautiful stucco figures of Lord Vishnu in various forms like Sri Adikesava, Varaha, Venugopala, Lakshmi-Narayana, Krishna, Lakshmi Narasimha and Sita-Lakshmana-Hanumath Sametha Sri Kodandarama.
The shrine for Ambujavalli Thayar, enshrining the stone image of this Goddess, is located in the circumambulatory passage, to the right of the main sanctum and faces east. Both the stone and processional deities have the thumb of both palms slightly bent as though beckoning the devotees to her presence. The sanctum of Sri Andal, also east-facing is seen on the other side of the main garbha-griha.
The sanctums for Garuda and Bhakta Anjaneya are also in this temple. While the former is situated directly in front of the main mandapam within the temple precincts, the shrine for Hanuman is located at a short distance from the temple, but directly facing the main sanctum. The sacred temple-tank is located behind the temple. There was once an underground passage leading from the temple to the tank.
Immediately in front of the entrance to the temple is a tall single-stone deepa-sthambham belonging to the Nayaka times. From the post-Nayaka times, the history of this temple is one of neglect. Till recently this temple was in a very dilapidated condition, overgrown with weeds, penetrated by the roots of trees and infested with snakes. This temple was renovated and reconstructed by philanthropists, with the Samprokshanam having been performed in 2007.
The temple is open only in the mornings from 8 to 9 am.
Vallipuram is a small village approximately 15 kms from Chengalpattu town. Vallipuram is a Village in Tirukalukundram Taluk in Kanchipuram District of Tamilnadu State, India. It is located 52 Kms towards South from District headquarters Kanchipuram, 10 Kms from Tirukalukundram and 73 Kms from State capital Chennai. The temple is located 3.5 kms further from Aanoor on the Northern bank of the Palar River. Nearest Railway Station is located at Chengalpet and Nearest Airport is located at Chennai.

Kanchi Periyavar once visited this place asked the people to name this as ‘Nadu Palani’. This is an Abhimana temple built by Sri Muthuswamy Pillai about 40 years back. Lord Murugan came in his dream and he started in a simple way with the Vel and now it has become a big temple. After Sri Muthuswamy Pillai’s period, the temple is being governed by Mysore Sri Ganapathy Sachthanandha Swamigal.
There are 120 steps to the temple on the hillock top and 4 wheelers can go straight to the top. While going through steps, first you can see Anjaneyar shrine on one side and Idumban shrine on the other. Then Siddhi Vinayagar shrine on one side and Raja Rajeswari with a Mahameru gopuram and Navagrahams on the other side. Then there is naga Prathishtai under the combo tree of Arasu and Vembu. There is an artificial fountain in the name of Saravanapoihai. The Samadhi of Sri Muthuswamy Pillai is also present.
The temple on top is a small one with only the Murugar shrine with the praharam. First we can see Vinayagar and then the Mayil vahanam and the front mandapam. The main deity is Dhandayuthapani facing east. The old deity got damaged and so a new deity made of Maragatha stone has been installed in Feb 2008. There are two Urchavar Deities namely Kalyana Urchavar deity with Valli and Deivanai and Arumugar on peacock along with Valli and Deivanai under the Rudraksha Pandhal. Vinayagar and Naga Dattareyar, i.e., Dattareyar (Brahma-Vishnu-Maheshwara) on the Nagar bed with Anaga (Lakshmi) Amman can be seen in this Temple.
The Temple will be open from 7 am – 12 noon and 5 – 8 pm.
Lot of devotees is taking Patha yatra with Kavadi from Chennai and various places on the occasion of Thai Poosam, Panguni Uthiram & Iyppasi Month. Rudraksha Kavadi is rare performance in this temple. Tens and thousands of devotees throng in the hill temple on the above days. Annadhanam is being fed on these occasions through the temple trust.  Guru Pooja of Muthuswamy Pillai is celebrated on the previous day of Thirukartikai, every year. Every Tuesday and on Krithigai at 8 AM, milk abhishegam is done to the Maragatha Dhandayuthapani. Panguni Uthiram Urchavam is the most popular one and 2-3 lakhs of people usually attend.
The important feature of this temple is, Lord will remove the obstacles in the marriage, if devotees pray with whole heartedly.
This hill temple is located near Achirappakkam on Chennai to Thindivanam route. After Mel Maruvathur just 2 Kms before Achirupakkam town you have to take a diversion to the left. There is an arch in the highway itself for Nadu Palani Murugan temple. From the arch, we have to go straight without any diversion till to the last for 6.5 kms to reach the temple at the Perukkarani (Perunkarunai) village.

https://www.bharattemples.com/kamala-varadharajar-temple-arasar-koil-kanchipuram/,"Kamala Varadharajar Temple, Arasar Koil, Kanchipuram
According to the temple legend, Lord Brahma performed penance under the Peepal tree and prayed to Lord Narayana to appear before him. In response, Perumal appeared before him with his consorts Sri Devi and Bhu Devi.
According to another legend, when Lord Brahma collected earth from River Palar to make the sacrificial altar at Kanchipuram the images of Kamala Varadaraja Perumal and his consorts were unearthed, and he kept them in this temple and worshipped them. Hence this temple, it is claimed, is more ancient than the Kanchipuram temple.
Presiding Deity is known as Kamala Varadharajar Temple and Mother is known as Sundara Mahalakshmi. The temple as well as the main shrine faces west. There is a large pillared mandapam in front of the principal sanctum-sanctorum. The main mage of Sri Kamala Varadaraja Perumal is believed to be of Salagrama. Sri Kamala Varadaraja Perumal is seen in a standing pose and holds a lotus in his right hand which is rare.
The processional image of this temple is also called Sri Kamala Varadaraja Perumal and is in a standing posture with four arms. His upper arms bear the conch and discus, while his lower right hand holds a lotus and the lower left hand rests on a mace. Since perumal is seen holding a lotus in this temple, he is revered as Sri Kamala Varadaraja Perumal. A shrine for garuda is situated opposite the sanctum for Perumal.
This temple is well-known for the image of Goddess Lakshmi, in a separate shrine which faces east. She is called Perundevi Thayar here just as in the Sri Varadaraja Swami Temple, Kanchipuram. She is also called Sundara Maha Lakshmi. Like all images of Goddess Lakshmi, this image of Perundevi Thayar has four arms. In the upper two arms she holds two lotuses while her lower right hand is in the attitude of assuring protection to her devotees and lower left hand is in boon-giving posture. She is called Aadhi Lakshmi Thaayar since she is considered the earliest Thaayar formed in the world.
However, this image of Perundevi Thayar in Arasar Kovil, seated in the padmasana pose, is unique as she has six toes in her right foot. Sundara Mahalakshmi sports ‘chubby cheeks’ like a baby sitting in the Padmasana Lotus posture with both hands in abhaya Hastham. The tradition in this temple is that Thayar should be worshipped first and then the devotee should visit the perumal shrine. The shrine for Thayar is also rather unique. It is fashioned like a separate temple with a small but beautiful mandapam in front.
This mandapam is of great artistic merit and has pillars made of resonant stone which are called musical pillars as they emit musical notes when tapped. The corbels of these pillars bear the plantain flower motif very characteristic of the architectural style of the Vijayanagara Empire. At the top of the pillars, there is a hole and a thin stick when passed through it, comes out cut into four pieces. Unfortunately this mandapam and the pillars are in a state of neglect and disrepair now.
There is also a garbha-griha for Sri Andal in this temple complex. There are images of Vishvaksena and the Srivaishanva preceptors Sri Vedanta Desika and Sri Manavala Mamuni in this temple. In front of the Kamala Varadaraja Perumal temple, is a shrine for Sri Anjaneya. The temple is on the banks of the Palar River. It is more popular as Mahalakshmi temple and if case you need to ask the route you can mention the same.
The temple is open only for a short time in the mornings and evenings.
This temple is located at Arasar koil about 1.5 km from the Vyagrapureeswarar temple. Travelling on the GST road from Chennai you come across Padalam cross road after Chengalpet. Take a left turn here (boards before this junction will indicate a right turn towards Vedanthangal). Keep going on the road to cross the railway track and continue to reach Arasar koil from GST the temple would be around 6 – 7 kms. The temple is on the left side. By train Padalam station is the nearest.

It is one of the temples where Moon (Chandran) prayed to Lord Shiva to get rid of his sin. There are inscriptions that state the above fact. When Lord Shiva swallowed the Aalahala poison, Parvathi Devi stopped it from entering inside by holding Lord’s neck and converted it into nectar (Amudhu) and hence the name, Amudhambigai.
Presiding Deity is known as Somanatheswarar and Mother is known as Amudhambigai. The Nandikeswarar is seen with a broad smiling face. This ancient temple did not survive time like many other temples in India. In 1917, this temple came back to life and some basic pujas were being done. Once while desilting the temple well to perform Abhisekam to the Lord, many other idols were found inside. They were idols of Lord Maha Shashta, Chandikeswarar, Murugan with his consorts Valli & Deivanai, Vinayagar and Durga. The temple had big outer walls whose foundations were found. There is a stand-alone stone inscription near the well which proves that this temple is ancient. The temple has been renovated recently.

As per the legend, Lord Brahma advised to churn the celestial sea to obtain “Amrutham” which would help devas to become immortal. Devas, unable to churn the sea alone with Manthara Mountain and Vasuki sought the help of Asuras. In the beginning, poison came out of the sea. Lord Shiva took the poison himself and saved this universe. At the end of the churning, Dhanvanthari appeared with Amrutham pot in his hand.
After the brief quarrel with Asuras, devas were able to retrieve the pot and consume the Amrutham. The devas started singing, dancing and enjoying after having Amrutham, and they totally forgot Lord Shiva due to who they were alive. After some time, they realized their mistake and apologized to Shiva. Lord Shiva forgave them and danced in the middle of his vahanam (vehicle) Nandi’s (bull) horns, and hence he got the name Nandeeswarar.
The Nandeeswarar Temple is an ancient temple. In fact, the place itself gets its name from this temple. This temple is believed to be built during Pallava period. The temple remains unknown not only for most of the people in Chennai, but even to those who live in Guduvanchery. The main deity of Nandeeswarar temple is Nandeeswarar. The idol of Nandeeswarar is big and attractive. It is facing east and located to the left side from entrance. The Main Sannidhi has a Vinayaka on the right and Murugan on the left.
The name of the Goddess is Soundara Nayaki, who is present in a standing posture at a separate shrine with a Simmam and Balipeedam. The Ambal is about 4 feet high. The koshta Vigrahas are as in any Shiva temple with Narthana Ganapathy, Dakshinamurthy, Mahavishnu and Brahma, Durga with Chandikeshwarar. Chandikeshwarar Sthuthi and Bhairavar Sthuthi are engraved here. There are separate shrines for Lord Ganesha and Lord Subramanya with his consorts Valli and Devasena.
There is beautiful statue of Lord Vishnu and an ancient idol of Nandi (bull) under the holy tree (sthala Vriksham). Sthala Vriksham is cannon ball tree (Nagalinga maram). This Vishnu Idol may be probably displaced from the Koshta during an earlier renovation. There is Navagraha Vigrahas at the right side of the Nandi. The Temple has a Tank (Kulam) on its east entrance and rituals are performed here during Mahalaya Paksha and other special occasions.
There are also other idols in the prakara (corridor surround the main deities) such as Ganesh, Shanmuga, another Ganesha, Dakshinamurthy, Vishnu, Brahma, Durga, Chandikeswarar, Surya, Bhairava and Veerabhadra. Even though the temple is old, it must have been rebuilt multiple times as there is not much sign of antiques in the temple except the idols and pillars.
Nandivaram-Guduvancheri is a panchayat town located in Kancheepuram district in the Indian state of Tamilnadu. The temple is half a km away from the Guduvanchery bus terminus. Guduvanchery is located at a distance of around 35 km from Chennai. The temple is very easily reached from NH 45. After Kattankulathur as you enter Guduvanchery the area is called Nandivaram. There is a road to the left before the bus stand the road leads to the temple in a furlong. There is also a road adjoining the bus stand leading to Thiruporur. The road to the temple is the first left not the Thiruporur road.

The place where the temple is situated once was under the kingdom of Arcot Nawab. And, in this kingdom, lived an aged couple – Yagna Narayana Sharma and Sarasavani. Yagna Narayana Sharma had a Guru – Yagnya Valkiyar, who belonged to Suklaya jeer Vedam. Yagna Narayana Sharma worked as a Diwan in the Nawab kingdom and both he and his wife Sarasavani had a great bhakti towards Sriman Narayanan.
Because of bhakti, the money, which they wanted to pay to the Nawab, was spent towards Deiva Kainkaryam. And as a result of this, they both were ordered to be prisoned. But they don’t want to accept the punishment and thought they spent the money only for good needs and for Deiva Kainkaryam. So, they went towards the Pushkarani of Thiruvidanthai Divyadesam and let their death happen in the Pushkarani.
But after their death, both of them were worried that they didn’t have any children to perform the Srardham for them. It is Bhagavan Sriman Narayanan who knows all of his Bhaktas thoughts and he fulfills them. And, he himself performed the Srardham, Thithi for the couples and even today the first theertham is given to the family members of Yagna Narayana Sharma and Sarasavani.
And even today, the Perumal himself perform Srardham for the people, who doesn’t have son or anyone else to perform and it is done during the time from 12 noon to 1.00 pm. That’s the reason why the Perumal of this sthalam is called with Thiru Naamam – Sri Srardha Samrakshana Narayanan.

Lots of Utsavams are performed in this sthalam. Brahmotsavam in Aani month, Pavitrotsavam in Aavani, Narasimha Jayanthi, Theerthavari in Swathi and Parivettai during Thai month are said to be some of the Utsavams that are performed in a great manner.
Pazhaiya Seevaram Parivettai:
Apart from its holiness due to the confluence of the three rivers, the hill temple is visited by Lord Varadaraja of Kanchipuram on the day following Sankaranthi, for what is known as “Pazhaiya Seevaram Parivettai”. Parivettai is observed to mark the destruction of evil forces by the Lord and is celebrated in almost all Vishnu temples.
It is said the present Moolavar idol of Lord Varadaraja at Kanchipuram was sculpted out of a rock here after the original wooden idol of Atthi Varadar got damaged hundreds of years ago. It is said to mark this, Lord Varadaraja is taken to Pazhaiya Seevaram on the day following Sankaranthi every year, when thousands of devotees gather here for Vana Bhojanam and aradhana.
Lord Varadaraja, who leaves his abode at 10 p.m. on Sankaranthi day, accompanied by devotees including those reciting Azhwars’ Paasurams and Vedas, is carried all the way to a distance of 15 km and goes around Pazhaiya Seevaram village at the foot of the hillock. He reaches the Narasimha temple, which is in the middle of the hillock, at noon and then he is taken to the Varadaraja Mandapam atop the hill, by climbing the 140 steps.
He stays in the mandapam there till 4 p.m. when Thirumanjanam (sacred bath) and Aradhana are performed. Later the Lord reaches the Narasimha Temple and both the Gods are taken to a temple at Thiru Mukkoodal, on the other side of Palar where a temple for Lord Srinivasa, known as Appan, exists.
There the three Gods, along with the Lords of two other temples, give darshan. Later Lord Varadaraja returns to Pazhaiya Seevaram along with Narasimhar and then starts his trek back to Kanchipuram late in the night and reaches there next morning.
Lord gave darshan to Athri Rishi: 
According to the Sthala Puranam, once in Naimisaaranyam, a Rishi by name Vishnu Siththar enquired with the other Rishis about a best place where he can get the Dharshan of Lord Vishnu as result of the penance. Another Rishi called Mareecha Muni explained the him about the existence of such a place on the earth, where one’s penance (Thapas) will get fulfilled with the Dharshan of Lord Narayana and guided him to this place which was called Padmagiri.
He also told the story of Athri Rishi, who got the Dharshan of the Lord in this place in the form of Sri Lakshmi Narasimhar, after his severe and dedicated penance. It is said that, Athri Rishi, after having Dharshan of the Lord, prayed the Lord to stay in this place and bless the people worshipping here. The Lord accepted his wish and stayed here in the same form to bless the mankind.
Holier than Prayag:
The place is also marked by the confluence of three rivers — Palar, Cheyyar and Vegavathi — and one can see the three rivers merging together at the place from the temple on the hillock. Known as Dakshina Prayag, it is a much holier place than the Triveni Sangamam or Prayag in the north, according to the octogenarian priest of the temple, Sri Narasimha Sundara Bhattacharyar. This is because, while at Prayag all the three rivers are not visible to the naked eye (river Saraswathi is Antharvahini, running underground) in Pazhaiya Seevaram the three rivers can be seen at the place of confluence.
Pazhaiya Seevaram Parivettai:
Apart from its holiness due to the confluence of the three rivers, the hill temple is visited by Lord Varadaraja of Kanchipuram on the day following Sankaranthi, for what is known as “Pazhaiya Seevaram Parivettai”. Parivettai is observed to mark the destruction of evil forces by the Lord and is celebrated in almost all Vishnu temples.
It is said the present Moolavar idol of Lord Varadaraja at Kanchipuram was sculpted out of a rock here after the original wooden idol of Atthi Varadar got damaged hundreds of years ago. It is said to mark this, Lord Varadaraja is taken to Pazhaiya Seevaram on the day following Sankaranthi every year, when thousands of devotees gather here for Vana Bhojanam and aradhana.
Lord Varadaraja, who leaves his abode at 10 p.m. on Sankaranthi day, accompanied by devotees including those reciting Azhwars’ Paasurams and Vedas, is carried all the way to a distance of 15 km and goes around Pazhaiya Seevaram village at the foot of the hillock. He reaches the Narasimha temple, which is in the middle of the hillock, at noon and then he is taken to the Varadaraja Mandapam atop the hill, by climbing the 140 steps.
He stays in the mandapam there till 4 p.m. when Thirumanjanam (sacred bath) and Aradhana are performed. Later the Lord reaches the Narasimha Temple and both the Gods are taken to a temple at Thiru Mukkoodal, on the other side of Palar where a temple for Lord Srinivasa, known as Appan, exists. There the three Gods, along with the Lords of two other temples, give darshan. Later Lord Varadaraja returns to Pazhaiya Seevaram along with Narasimhar and then starts his trek back to Kanchipuram late in the night and reaches there next morning.
Dakshina Prayag:
In Krutha Yuga, there lived a great devotee of Lord Vishnu, who wanted to take bath daily in river Ganga, which emerges from the foot of Sriman Narayana. He took bath in this Sangamam and treated this water as the Ganga River and worshipped the Vishnu in Sudharsana malai (Hill). Another saint lived here and treated this river as the river Yamuna. Because of this, both the rivers Yamuna and Ganga emerged here and the other river Vegavathi (Saraswathi River) also emerged and these 3 rivers merge in the great Pazhaya Seevaram sthala.
This river flows in between Padmagiri and Sudharsana malai. It is believed that if we take bath in this river and get the Seva(darshan) of Sri Lakshmi Narasimha in Padmagiri and Sri Venkatesha  in Sudharsana  malai, it  is equivalent to 100 times taking bath in Prayag. It is believed that if we take bath in this river for a month and rest under the shadow of Pipal tree in Padmagiri, it is said to cure all sorts of sins and diseases.
Sudharsana Malai (Hill):
On the opposite side of Padmagiri another hill is found which is called as “Sudharsana malai” where Sri Prasanna Venkatesa Perumal is giving his Seva. This Perumal gave his Prathyaksham (darshan) to Brighu Muni and King Chakravarthy.
Etymology:
The name Sripuram has a hoary past. After the annihilation of Hiranyakasipu, Lord appeared ferocious. From the legends it is learned that the Lord was pacified by goddess Mahalakshmi at this shrine. Since  goddess Mahalakshmi played the key role in appeasing the Lord and hence the village got the name Sripuram, as a token of gratitude. Legends equate it as ‘Sathya Varadha Kshetram.’ Then it got corrupted to Seevaram. It is difficult to make out the significance for the word ‘Pazhaiya’ or old.
Rivers in full flow:
Devotees who have been to this temple in the 1960s/70s say that they used to reach here by bullock cart (there were no buses then) and would stay here for a month enjoying the cool breeze and peaceful surroundings. The rivers, they say, used to run full through the year which would make a wonderful sight from the top of the temple.
Suyambu Madapalli:
The `Madapalli`(place for preparing Prasadam) is believed to be `Suyambu‘ (appeared on its own).
Pazhaiya Seevaram is located on the  Kanchipuram – Chengalpattu State Highway SH 58 and it is about 16 km from Chengalpattu and about 20 km from Kanchipuram.  While going from Chengalpattu, one can reach Pazhaya Seevaram 5 kms before Walajabad.

There is a Woman-Siddha in swayambu form in the place wherefrom Mother Adhi Parasakthi emerged. She is head of all Siddhas. It is believed that a huge number of Siddhas are in this holy soil. Fertile lands are on the northern part of the temple. For the convenience of devotees staying during nights, it was suggested that a thatched roof tent may be built. But Bangaru Adigalar says that permission from Mother could be obtained as still many Siddhas exist under this land. Hence, the temple is called Siddhar Peetam.
Where the current temple’s sanctum sanctorum stands today, there was only a neem tree in the 1960s. Unlike every other neem tree, which bear bitter tasting fruit, this tree secreted and dripped a sweet nectar. Residents of that village found that they had an urge in their mind to taste this nectar whenever they passed by this tree. Since many passers reported of curing their illness and diseases after tasting this nectar, the word spread swiftly to entire village and its neighborhood. So it became a customary for these villagers to take a drop of this nectar to ailing friends and relatives. They treated this as a medicinal tree and protected it from grazing cattle and wood cutters.
In 1966, a severe storm uprooted this neem tree, which exposed the Swayambu underneath to the villagers for the first time. Swayambu means a self-emerging, naturally formed oval shaped object (carved of rock). People built a small hut on top of this Swayambu and conducted poojas (prayer rituals) to it. This place is known as Siddhar Peetam (Siddhar in Tamil language means enlightened or evolved souls. Peetam means throne. Thus Siddhar Peetam means The Throne of Evolved Souls or Great Spiritual Masters/Gurus) where 21 Siddhars are laid in Jeeva Samadhi.
Swayambu alone was worshipped for many years. The idol of Mother Adhi para Sakthi was installed later in the sanctum sanctorum on November 25, 1977. The idol of beautiful Mother is three feet tall, seated on thousand-petal lotus seat, with her right leg folded and the left leg resting on the lotus petals. The thousand petal lotus has significance in meditation. In this idol form, she holds the bud of a lotus in her right hand, the mudra (sign) of knowledge in her left hand and with her hair plait and knotted upwards like a crown.
The temple is open from 3.00 a.m. to 1.00 p.m. and from 3.00 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.
The timings given are approximate. It may vary on certain special occasions. On Sundays, Tuesdays, Fridays, New moon days, full moon days, and Siddhar Peedam festival days, there will be no break in Darshan Timings.
Devotees throng the temple for all prosperity in life. Devotees offer Shakti Mala garlands, carry Irumudi as followed in the Ayyappan prayer model and they do the Anga Pradakshina – rolling around the prakara.
Melmaruvathur is 92 km far from Chennai on the Tiruchi National Highway and falls 25km before the Tindivanam. It’s a straight single road from Chennai and is well connected through train and buses. Nearest Railway Station is located at Melmaruvathur and Nearest Airport is located at Chennai.

Kali slaying Asuras Sumban & Nisumban:
Two asuras, Sumban and Nisumban, did penance seeking the blessings of Lord Brahma. When Lord Brahma appeared, they prayed to bless them with the boon that they should meet their end only in the hands of a virgin appearing from Godess Uma Devi. Pleased with their penance, Lord Brahma sanctioned their wish. Having obtained the boon from Lord Brahma, the two asuras became arrogant and started indulging in all types of evil deeds.
They declared war against Devas, defeated and made them their slaves and continuously tortured them. Unable to undergo the sufferings, Devas prayed to Siva. To answer their prayer, Lord Siva cast his eyes upon his consort, Goddess Uma Devi and addressed her as Kali. Sri Ambigai transformed her color to black and took the form of Goddess Kali. She came down to earth and on the banks of river Palar, created a theertham, after praying to Sri Vinayaga, installed a Sivalingam and began her penance.
After many years of penance, Lord Siva appeared before Goddess Kali. His grace removed her black color and granted golden color. The black color that got out of Goddess Kali fought with the asuras and destroyed them. Since Sri Ambigai obtained golden color (Swarna), thereinafter the place was known as Sornapuri.
Arrogance of Lakshmi:
Once Goddess Lakshmi became arrogant over her beautiful appearance. Because of that, she was cursed by Sri Vishnu and eventually, she lost her beauty. She came down to Sornapuri and with the help of Kubera, constructed a pond full of golden lotus flowers. She prayed to Lord Sornapuriswarar, by offering those golden lotus flowers and regained her original beauty. Also, Kubera was elevated as head of all wealth.
Ardent Devotee attained Salvation here:
Sivanesan, an ardent devotee of Lord Sornapuriswarar, was continuously offering worship in this temple. Lord Siva granted his Dharshan to Sivanesan and transformed him into two lingas, namely, Uthira Nadhar and Dakshina Nadhar. Thus, Sivanesan attained Mukthi (Liberation).
Presiding Deity is known as Sornapuriswarar and Mother is known as  Anandha valli. As Lord Siva ordained, Sri Bhairavar became the controlling deity of this place. Sri Vinayagar deity, installed and prayed by Sri Ambigai, is still found in this temple, as Sri Sakthi Vinayaga.
Those who pray to Sri Sornapuriswarar by lighting ghee lamps (Nei Vilakku) and offering Vilva leaves (Vilva archanai) will be bestowed with abundant wealth and excellent health. This prayer is best, if done continuously for 18 Mondays (Somavaram). If one comes around both Uthira and Dakshina Nathars for 18 times daily and offers his sincere prayers, it is sure that his cycle of births – deaths will come to an end and he will attain Mukthi.
Salavakkam is situated at about 20 Kms away to the West of Chengalpet and 35 Kms to the East of Kancheepuram.

Adi Kesava Perumal Temple (also called Ramanujar Temple) is dedicated to Hindu god Vishnu located in Sriperumpudur, Kanchipuram district, in the South Indian state of Tamilnadu. It is constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Adikesava Perumal and his consort Lakshmi as Yatirajanathavalli Thayar. This is the only temple where Goddess Lakshmi has a name attributed to a devotee of the Lord. She is a varaprasathi who grants all wishes. The temple is believed to be the birthplace of Ramanuja, the exponent of Vaishtavaidata philosophy.
The gold plated shrine in front of the hall of Ramanuja is built by the Maharaja of Mysore. The temple is open from 6:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 4 p.m. to 8 p.m and has six daily rituals at various times of the day. Various festivals are celebrated in the temple, with the Chittirai Brahmotsavam, Masi Pooram festival during February – March and Panguni Uthiram festival during March – April being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamilnadu. Sriperumpudur is located on the Chennai – Bangalore Highway (NH 4) about 40 Kilometers South-West of Chennai.
The temple is open from 6.30 a.m. to 12.00 a.m. and from 4.00 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.
Those facing adverse aspects of Rahu and Ketu planets and those facing delays in marriage due to Kalasarpa dosha in whose horoscopes the snake planets are at both ends covering the other planets in between them, pray here for relief. Devotees perform abishek to Sri Ramanuja with milk as a prayer commitment. The water left over from the daily ablutions and the cloth worn by the deities is squeezed and given as Prasadam (blessing) to devotees at Ramanuja Swamy Temple. This cloth is said to cure skin diseases and bless childless couples with children. Every month, on the day that the Thiruvadirai star reigns in the sky, many people come to witness the milk ablutions and to get the blessings of the Lord.
The temple is open from 6:30 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamilnadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Ushathkalam at 8 a.m., Kalasanthi at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 7:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: Alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) & deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both adi kesavan and his consort yathirajavalli. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple.
Various festivals are celebrated in the temple, with the Chittirai Brahmotsavam, Masi Pooram festival during February – March and Panguni Uthiram festival during March – April being the most prominent. During Chittirai Brahmotsavam, the temple car housing the festival deities of Adikesava and Yathirajavalli is drawn around the streets of Sriperumpudur. The festival car was not operational for the 25 years preceding 2003 and was resumed from 2003. The festival is followed by Thiruavadara Utsavam of Ramanuja, the birthday festival of the saint. On the last Friday of Panguni (March-April) or on the last Friday of Chithirai, Thirumanjanam is simultaneously performed for Lord Adikesava Perumal, Mother Yathiraja Valli, Sri Andal and Acharya Sri Ramanuja.
In Vaikasi (May-June), the Adhi Kesava Perumal Vasantha Uthsavam is popular. On festival days, the Utsava Murthy (processional image) is decorated with jewels, dressed in glittering robes and Ramanuja carries a sword symbolic of his status as the king of saints. The image is brought to the garden after a ride in the temple car in the morning. Before the Thirumanjanam (ablution), the jewels and robes are removed and the icon can be seen in all its original glory with the back of the head shaped like a hooded serpent, reminding viewers that he was the incarnation of Adisesha, Vishnu’s iconic serpent. Devotees eagerly wait to see the Thirumanjanam and the Pushpa Pallakku (flower decorated palanquin) that follows. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamilnadu.
Major Festivals are listed below;
Chella Pillai Utsavam:
Once, a king from Delhi took the idol of Narayanapuram to please his daughter. Ramanuja went to Delhi to recover the idol and the idol is believed to have fallen on his lap as a child by divine powers as a child. The Chella Pillai Utsavam is held every year commemorating the event.
Story behind the name Boodhapuri:
The place is known as Aranyaranam and Boodhapuri. In the Kailasha Lord Shiva once dancing and Lord Shiva was deeply involved in dancing and he was doing Avesha Narthanam and suddenly his robes fell down, seeing this all the Bhootha ganas laughed. Then Shiva becomes very angry on his Bhootha Ganas and curses them that they should go to Bhoo Loka and do Nithya vasam. Then Bhootha ganas realize their mistakes , they repent and  pray to  Shiva for his mercy , Shiva tells once I have given the shapa (Curse) I cannot take it back, so please go to Brahma ask for Pariharam.
Then Brahma tells that please go to the Punya Bhoomi of Great Bharatha Varusham, Go to a place known as Arunaranyam Kshetram which is situated in between Thiruvenkatam Hills and Sathayavratha Kshetram (Kanchi) and pray to Lord Maha Vishnu for Saapa Vimochanam. As instructed by the Brahma comes to Arunaranyam Kshetram and then Lord Narayana is pleased with Bhootha ganas. Then he calls the Shiva and tells him to take back the Bhootha ganas back in Kailasha. Then he instructed Ananthaalwan (Adhi Seshan) to create a Sarasu, and then instructs the Bhootha Ganas to take bath in the Sarasu and get relieved of the curse.
Then they Request the Lord also to stay in this Kshetram and bless the world. Then they do Pradhakshinam to Lord Adhi Kesavan (Lord Maha Vishnu). Then they build a Temple, small town and they did Usthavam to Lord Adhi Kesavan and they got rid of the shapa (curse). In those days it was known as Bhoodhapuri and later on it became Sriperambhoothur and now it is Sriperumpudur.
Avathara Sthalam of Ramanuja:
Once there lived a great King named Hareetha Maharaja, he was the grandson of King Ambarisha and he is the decedent of Ramar. He was passing by a dense forest, then he hears a shrill moaning of a cow, he goes in the direction where the voice was coming, he sees that a Tiger has caught the cow and was about to kill the Cow, and  the Kohathi Dosham is going to take place and since he is Kshatriya and a King  he thinks that it is his duty to protect the weakling, and there is no sin in killing the tiger, He aims at Tiger, meanwhile tiger thinks i should do something that King also suffers with that he kills the Cow, and King Hareetha kills the tiger. Since he has seen the Kohathi taking place, the Dosham comes to him, he is worried, then suddenly he hears Asareeri (Divine Voice) and asks him to proceed to Sathayavratha Kshetram and take bath in Anantha Sarasu and worship Lord Adhi Kesava, your sins will vanish.
Then he goes back to Ayodhya and Consults Vashista Maharishi and, he tells about the Sriperumpudur’s Mahatmiyam and narrates how Bhootha Ganas got rid of the Saapa and also the route. King Hareetha makes alternative arrangement to run the Kingdom and proceeds to Sriperumpudur. Then he takes bath in Anantha Sarasu and prays to Lord Adhi Kesavan. Then finally Lord Vishnu appears before Hareetha Maharaja and instructs him all the Mantras which will help in getting rid of the Dosham, He also tells all these years you were Kshatriya and due to my blessings now you will become Brahmin and henceforth your descendants also will become Brahmin (even today his decedents are from his Gothra and they are known as Hareetha Gothra), He also gives the Upadesha of all Mantras.
Then Hareetha Maharaja rebuilds the Adhi Kesava temple and does consecration of the temple on an auspicious day, then he hears the Divine voice (Asareeri) that in near future great soul will be born in your Vamsa (Descendant) who will lead the world to greater height of Gyana and Bhakti, and that Great Soul is none other than Ramanuja. Then in year CE 1017 On a Thursday, in the Tamil Month of Chitrai, Sukla Paksha Panchami, in the constellation of Aridra (Thiruvadirai)   Asuri Keshavacharya and Kanthimathi were blessed with the Child and were named as Ramanuja. He was later given the title of Bashyakara, Emperumanar, Elayai Alwan, Yathirajar, Udayavar etc.
There is a mandapam in front of the temple where Sri Ramanuja was born.  During the 10 day Chithirai festival during April-May, Acharya graces from this mandapam.  On his birth star day, he is placed in a cradle as a child and fed with milk in a conch.  During this festival, the Parivattam turban linen – is brought from 36 Vaishnava shrines-Divya Desas – as a courtesy to the Acharya.
Than Uganda Thirumeni:
He toured the length and breadth of Bharatha Desha to preach the Vishistadvaita. Then Just few days before leaving the mortal coil and going to Vaikunta, His disciple Mudhaliandan’s Son Kanthadai Annan got a Archa Vigraham of Ramanuja and presented before him, then Swami hugged the Moorthy and transferred all his power to it, then Udayavar instructed to the Prathistai of this Vigraham on Tamil Month Thai on Constellation of Pushya Star at Sriperumpudur, This Vigraham is what we see in Sriperumpudur and it is known as Than Uganda Thirumeni. Ramanujar’s Vigraha, Divine archa-vigraha made of 5 metals including gold, silver, bronze, copper and iron.
Story behind Ramanuja gracing in White Robes during Chithirai Festival:
Ramanuja (1017–1137 CE) was a Hindu theologian, philosopher, and scriptural exegete, born in a Tamil family at Sriperumpudur. Vaishnavites, see him one of the most important acharya (teacher) of their tradition and as the leading expounder of Vishishtadvaita, one of the classical interpretations of the Vedic philosophy. Ramanuja grew up under the tutelage of Tirumalai Nambi, who was working in Tirumala Venkateswara Temple.
A king wanted to take vengeance on Sri Ramanuja and planned to punish him.  Knowing the king’s plans, a disciple, Koorathalwar, wearing the saffron went to the king.  Sri Ramanuja escaped in white robes. The king blinded Koorathalwar for failing his plans. With a view to respect the disciple who lost his eyes for him, Sri Ramanuja graces in white robes on one day during the Chithirai festival.
Lizard Structure:
There is a lizard sculpture behind Sri Ramanuja’s shrine. People worship this lizard for relief from sins.
Ramanuja rebirth as Manavala Mamunigal:
Acharya Sri Ramanuja lived a full circle of life spanning 120 years. (A full life means that a person should undergo the prescribed period of all the planets in his life that covers 120 years, not a day less.)  Sri Ramanuja, in next his birth was born as Manavala Mamunigal who taught the meaning of commentaries on scriptures. His idol is seen on a pillar in the temple.  There is also a separate temple for Acharya Sri Manavala Mamunigal outside the temple.
Belief of Temple Prasadam curing illness:

Life Story of Embar:
An Amsam of Garudalwar incarnated as first son of Kamalanayana Bhattar and Srimathi Periya Pirattiyaar in Krothana Nama year, Thai Month, Punarvasu Nakshatram at a sacred place called Maduramangalam, also called as Then Madhura. He was named as Govinda Dhasar and he had a younger brother named Siriya Govinda Perumal. Sri Embar was related to Ramanuja, as his cousin brother and had great Bhakthi and regard for him. Both Ramanuja and Embar were initially learning Vedantha under an Advaitha Acharya named Yadhava Prakasha.
On many occasions arose when the Saivite Guru clashed with Ramanuja, when the Guru misinterpreted Vedantic statements. Ramanuja fearlessly pointed out the errors in the Guru’s interpretations and corrected him. This enraged the Guru. Fearing that one day, Ramanuja would demolish Advaita philosophy, he plotted to kill Ramanuja and hence he planned a pilgrimage to Kashi, thinking that they can kill Ramanuja on the way in the forest and clear the sin by taking a holy dip in Ganga.
At this point of time Embar somehow came to know about his master’s evil plan and saved Ramanuja’s life. Embar was a Shiva Bhaktha earlier in his life and later accepted Srivaishnavism due to the intervention of Sri Ramanuja and Sri Thirumalai Nambigal and became a great Acharya. He was given the title of “Embar” by Sri Ramanuja himself. Embar is the shortened version of the term Emperumaanar. Sri Embar is referred to as the “Ramanuja padhachhaaya” (shadow of the lotus feet of Bhagavath Ramanuja).
Pradhakshinam:
Lord gave Pradhakshinam for Saptha Rishis who performed Aswamedha Yaga and Suparna Maharaja the ruler of Thondai Mandalam.

https://www.bharattemples.com/vallakottai-subramaniaswamy-temple-sriperumpudur-kanchipuram/,"Vallakottai Subramaniaswamy Temple, Sriperumpudur, Kanchipuram
Arunagirinathar, the famous Tamil saint-poet has sung about the Vallakottai Subrahmanya Swamy in seven poems in his famous work ‘Thirupugazh’. The temple has a gateway leading to a pillared hall and the sanctum. The temple is open from 6:30 am – 12:00 pm and 5 – 8:30 pm. Five daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Adi Pooram festival being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamilnadu.
The temple will be open between 06.30 Hrs to 13.00 Hrs and in the evening from 16.00 Hrs to 20.30 Hrs. On Sundays and special pooja days the temple will be kept open between 06.00 Hrs to 20.00 Hrs without closing.
Devotees believe that a holy dip in the Vajra Theertham tank with the chanting of the mantra ‘Aum Saravanabhava’ will end all their problems.
Murugan slayed Demon Vallan here:
As per Hindu legend, there was a demon by name Vallan who was troubling the Devas, the celestial deities. The Devas sought the help of Murugan. He informed them that the time had come to destroy the demon. He eventually waged a war and slayed the demon at the place. He established the place as Vallan Kottai, literally meaning the “Fort of Vallan”.
Indra worshipped Murugan here:
Indra, the king of Devas, requested his Guru Brihaspati to suggest a place for him to worship Murugan. He suggested going to Vallakottai, an abode of Murugan. Indra came to Vallakottai, pierced the earth with his weapon Vajrayudha to create a tank to extract water. He performed ablution to image of Murugan at this place and attained his needs. Since Indra created the tank with his Vajrayudha, the temple tank is named as Vajra Theertha.
Bhagiratha disrespect to Sage Naradha:
As per another legend, a king by name Bhagiratha was ruling the Elanji kingdom. He was very haughty to sage Naradha and to teach him a lesson for his behaviour, Naradha infuriated a demon king named Goran to attack Elanji kingdom. Goran was a powerful demon and he made a sudden attack. Bhagiratha was unable to control the forces and eventually lost the battle to Goran. Realizing his mistake, he sought the advice of Naradha.
The sage advised him to find sage Durvasa, who could find a resolution. The king roamed around the forest for a long time and finally found Durvasa. The sage advised him to worship Murugan at Vallakottai to get back his kingdom. The king worshipped Murugan at this place for a long time and built the temple.
Lord Murugan appeared to Arunagirinathar in dream to tell about this place:
Arunagirinathar was advised by Lord to Visit this temple on the way to Thiruthani from Thiruporur, in his dream. He has sung 7 hymns in Thirupugazh in praise of Lord Sri Subramaniyar.
Etymology:
Arunagirinathar denotes this Vallakottai as Kotainakar, Kotappati, Kotaiyampati, Kottai enumpati, and Kottai’. Though Arunagirinathar mentioned this place by many names, it is presently popular only as Vallakottai. There are many interpretations available for this name; yet only one seems to be plausible. In Kanchipuram District, near Vallakottai, there is another Murugan, ‘Tirupati’ (holy place) by name ‘Vallam’. By connecting this holy place ‘Vallam’, the people of the area would have called ‘Vallakottai’ first. Afterwards it seems that this holy place would have naturally got the name of Vallakottai.
Vallakottai is situated on the highway between Sriperumpudur and Singapperumal Koil near Chengalpattu. It is located at about 30 Kms from Tambaram. The place is about 20 kms west of Singapperumal Koil, on Chennai – Vizhupuram National High way. Frequent bus facility is available to the village from Tambaram and Sriperumpudur.
From Tambaram Buses 583, 583 D and 55 N to Sriperumpudur pass through this village. From Tambaram Sanatorium new bus terminus 55 L and 55 A are plying to Vallakottai. All buses to Kanchipuram via Oragadam and Sriperumpudur passes through this village. Nearest Railway Station is located at Kanchipuram, Chengalpet and Tambaram. Nearest Airport is located at Chennai.
The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed five times a day: Go Pooja at 6:30 a.m., Kalasandhi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikala Poojai at 8:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., and Arthajama Pooja at 8:15 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: Alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) & deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for the presiding deities. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 6:30 am – 12:00 pm and 5 – 8:30 pm on all days except during festive occasions when it has extended timings.
The temple possesses gold, jewels, diamonds, and rubies, silver vessel and other costly articles worth many lakhs of rupees. Every Thursday, Lord Subramaniaswamy is decorated with Diamond Vel. The day of Krittika is very important and thousands of people worship the Lord every month on this day. The main festivals are the Brahma Utsavam, Skanda Shashti, Adi Kiruthikai and the festival of Subrahmanya’s marriage with Valli.
A popular event performed a few years ago is the Sri Subrahmanya Sahasranama (1008 names of Subrahmanya) Archana. A Sahasra namamala, a garland of gold coins on each of which one of the 1,008 names of the Lord was inscribed, was made and offered to the deity. Devotees from far and near in large numbers participated in this holy and pious act.
Here also pilgrims carry Kavadis to the shrine and abhishekams are performed to the idol on behalf of the devotees. Bathing of the deity in holy ashes, known as Vibhuti Abhishekam is a feature here as in Palani temple and in that Abhishekam the idol has a very captivating and awe-inspiring aspect.

Rudras merged with Shiva Heart:
It is said to be 1,700 years old, the Lord in the temple is known as Rudrakoteeswarar. According to legend, the celestial beings who could not bear the torture of the Kodi Asuras who emanated from Kashyapa rishi, prayed to Lord Siva, who let loose a Kodi Rudras from his chest who killed the asuras. The Rudras, after finishing the task assigned to them, worshipped the Lord to atone for the sin of killing them. Rudras were pardoned and got merged in his heart.
Story behind the partly buried Nandhi:
Once Vishnu came to see Shiva here in the form of Garudan; When Garudazhwar was waiting outside, before Vishnu came out, Nandikeswarar blew his breath over Garudazhwar and the feathers of Garudazhwar fell off. Shiva then punished Nandikeswarar by making him sink to the ground. When Nandhi’s body started to sink into the ground, at the behest of Vishnu, Shiva stopped Nandikeswarar at that point. So, you can see Nandikeswarar partly buried at the ground.
Benefit of doing Pradhakshina of a crore of Rudhrars at a time:
By worshipping here once, one can get the benefit of doing Pradhakshina of a crore of Rudhrars at a time.
Story behind reclined position of Ambal:
Ambal, also known as Sri Abirami, has calmed down Sri Kali Devi, who was brimming with anger. Hence, she is appearing in a slightly reclined position.
The Rudhran Temple is older than the Vedhagreeswarar temple. As per procedure, one has to first visit Rudhran temple and then only the Vedhagreeswarar. Main Deity is known as Rudrakoteeswarar and Mother is known as Pennin Nallaal. Main deity of this temple is a Suyambu Moorthi. Kodi (One Crore) Rudhra devas have worshipped this deity and got relieved of their curse. Hence, the main deity is called as Sri Rudhra Kodeeswarar. Ambal, also known as Sri Abirami, has calmed down Sri Kali Devi, who was brimming with anger. Hence, she is appearing in a slightly reclined position.
The temple entrance has Nandi with his consort, Suyaprabha Devi on the wall. Sthala Vriksham of this Temple is Vilva tree (each leaf containing nine petals) and Theertham of this Temple is Rudhra Theertham (situated inside the temple complex). The temple has an east facing entrance with a Balipeetham, Vinayaka and Murugan sannidhis in front. The Koshta Vigrahas and four savants are represented in statue form.
The Rudrakoteeswarar Temple, where the name of the Goddess is Rudrani, (also known as Abhirami Nayaki) has a five-tier Rajagopuram. The tower was in a dilapidated condition, but due to the effort of devotees, four tiers, besides the Kalkaram, have been renovated. The flooring around the prakaram outside the sanctum sanctorum has been newly laid. The superstructure above the Nandi mandapam has been rebuilt. But the Madapalli (kitchen) is in a highly dilapidated condition & requires immediate repair.
The shrine of the Goddess is situated on the left side and She looks southwards through an opening on the temple wall towards the Kali Temple at Vattaparai (circular rock), situated at some distance. The temple also has shrines for Dakshinamurthi, Vinayaka and Subramania with his consorts, the Thevaram trio — Appar, Sundarar and Gnanasambandar — and also Manickavasagar. While in the Siva temples the image of Lingodbhavar is found on the western side of the sanctum sanctorum, here one can find the image of Mahavishnu with Varada Hastham.
An ancient poem, inscribed in the inner wall of the temple says, while Kasi (Benares), Thiruvarur, Chidambaram, Thiruvannamalai, Kanchi, Kalahasti and Madurai formed the body of Lord Siva the Koteeswarar Temple at Rudrakoti or Rudran Koil is his heart.
All the annual functions pertaining to a Sivan temple are being celebrated in this temple. At present, one time pooja is being performed in this temple, every day. Since it is not known to many, the no. of devotees visiting this temple is very less compared to the hill temple in Thirukazhukundram.
According to Saiva Siddhanta, Rudra is the presiding deity of one of the five elements of Nature — Fire. Rudra is referred to in the Vedas, not as a sectarian deity, but as the Supreme Lord, who guides the Universe from one level of perfection to the higher one. Sri Rudram, which forms part of the Upanishads, speaks of the glory of Rudra and says that the Lord is always pleased with obeisance and it offers salutations to him many times.
Praying to Rudrakoteeswarar at this temple continuously during 16 Pradoshams, would rid one of ailments of the heart, hypertension, diabetes and also problems caused by planetary changes. The Vedas also speak about the presence of 11 Rudras and their consorts, 11 Rudranis. Of the 108 Sakthi Peetams, the 24th is considered to be Rudrakoti’s Sakthi.
Devi Bhagavatham says that she adorns the Rudrani Peetam. It is believed that praying to her at the temple on nine full moon days helps a devotee unite in wedlock, lead a happy family life and be free from all afflictions. It is believed that each prayer is multiplied one crore times here hence it is a very sacred place to pray.
Thirukazhukundram is located on State Highway 58 between Sadras & Thiruttani, 70 kilometres (43 mi) from Chennai and 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from the tourist town of Mahabalipuram.

Lord Venkatesa Perumal helping Kind Thondaiman in war:
According to the legend, the king Thondaiman once started to Thirupathi to have darshan of Lord Venkatesa Perumal. He then heard a divine voice telling him that it was not the time to visit Thirupathi as a king from a neighbouring country was nearing his kingdom to wage a war. The voice advised him to be with his son during war time to save the country and later to visit Thirupathi.
On hearing this Thondaiman prayed to Lord Venkatesa Perumal and the Lord blessed him to win the battle and gifted him with his Sanku (Conch) & Chakra (Wheel). Thondaiman successfully won the battle and on his way back both the weapons Sanku and Chakra vanished. Later, the Lord directed Sri Ramanujar to install Sanku & Chakra for him at this place. That’s how the deity here had got Sanku & Chakra here.
Then the king Thondaiman surrendered to Perumal at Thirupathi seeking ‘Moksha’. The Lord directed him to come to Thirumukkudal to grant Moksha to him. The king visited here to have darshan of the Lord. Till then, the Lord here was said to be in ‘Sayana Kolam’ (reclining posture like Ranganathar). When the king visited here the Lord is said to have changed his posture and gave him darshan in standing posture.
The king Thondaiman, out of his excitement and bliss, embraced the Lord saying ‘Appaney Venkatesa’ (அப்பனே வெங்கடேசா), means ‘Oh My Father Venkatesa!’ and from then the Lord here came to be known as ‘Appan Venkatesa Perumal’. The king Thondaiman is said to have built this temple initially for Lord Sri Venkatesa Perumal. The same king is said to have built the temple at Thirupathi (Thirumalai) as well as Thirumalai Vaiyaavoor, which is called Southern Thirupathi.
Lord Vishnu darshan to Brighu Rishi:
Lord Srinivasa provided darshan, facing north, to Brighu Maha Rishi who undertook penance here and hence he is seen in a standing posture facing Northern Direction.
Divya Desam Connection:
While this is not a Divya Desam, there are some interesting connections with Tirupathi and Oppiliappan Divya Desams. One finds Tirupathi Lord’s Conch and Chakra at this temple. Similar to Oppiliappan temple, Lord Srinivasa is said to have provided darshan to Markandeya Rishi (as Ranganatha in his Sayana Kolam) and to Bhoodevi as Kannan. Hence, Markandeya Rishi and Bhoo Devi are seen by the side of Appan Venkatesan.
Equivalent to Kasi:
Having bath at the confluence of the three rivers and undertaking Pitru Tharpanam on the river bank is said to provide Puniyam equivalent to having bath in Kasi.
Kanchi Varadar’s annual visit to Thiru Mukkoodal: 
Kanchipuram Sri Varadaraja Perumal’s Parivettai is a very popular festival here. Five Perumals – Lord Varadarajaswamy of Kanchipuram, Lord Lakshmi Narasimha, Pazhaya Seevaram, Sri Appan Venkatesa Perumal, Thirumukkudal and two other Perumals of nearby temples meet together at Thirumukkudal temple courtyard and stay in different mandapas  on Kaanum Pongal Day – Tamil month ‘Thai’ (16th January), which is said to be a delight to watch. On this evening, Lord Srinivasa of Thiru Mukkoodal welcomes Salavakkam Perumal and Pazhaya Seevaram Narasimha, Kanchi Varadar as well as other one nearby Perumal at this temple. Later in the evening, all these five deities go out on a street procession around Thiru Mukkoodal.

In 1836, Ayya Vaikundar, a member of the Hindu lower class, wanted to pull the temple chariot, a task traditionally reserved for the elite. This angered and frightened the members of the upper class. King Swathi Thirunal, who was temporarily residing at Suchindrum (4 miles (6.4 km) away), had Ayya arrested and led away, tied to a horse. In Swamithoppu, where the arrest took place, Ayya’s followers objected but he advised them to remain patient. He said,
“Let them learn who I am and I will be back to you without any harm.”
Ayya was brought before the king and answered the king’s questions put to him with wisdom. However, when the king asked Ayya to guess the item in his right hand, Ayya dismissed the king, saying everyone’s soul was of the same value because the universe was created by one god. The king was angered and condemned Ayya to fifteen months imprisonment in Thiruvananthapuram and further incarceration from November 1838 in Singarathoppu.
Despite all sorts of torture such as brutality or poisoning, being made to walk through fire or being burnt in a lime kiln, being fumigated with burning chillies or being publicly taunted with a hungry tiger, Ayya maintained his composure and appeared showered with flowers. When a guard poked the tiger with a spear, the animal grabbed the spear then suddenly let it go. In the incident, the spear hit a Brahmin chieftain who died of his injury. The king offered to release Ayya if he agreed to remain within his caste but Ayya refused, saying he had no caste. He also refused to leave jail until he was ready.
This news spread Thiruvananthapuram and throughout India. People came before him in large groups with fruits, flowers, and other gifts. His followers were from parts of south Tamilnadu. On the 19th day of the Tamil month of Masi (March 3, 1839), Ayya returned to Swamithoppu Pathi. Ayya and his followers reached Swamithoppu on the 20th day of Masi, now an auspicious day amongst Ayya’s devotees celebrated with a procession and a public holiday in south Tamilnadu.
Peruvilai is located at about 2 Kms from Nagercoil, 6 Kms from Nagercoil Bus Stand, 6 Kms from Nagercoil Railway Station, 13 Kms from Thuckalay, 13 Kms from Boothapandi, 23 Kms from Kanyakumari and 72 Kms from Thiruvananthapuram.

The Palliyarai contains two oil lamps (kuthuvilakku), an elunetru, and a large mirror. On a raised pedestal, covered with Kavi cloth, the temple also preserves some articles believed to have been used by Ayya Vaikundar, including a rattan cane (perampu) and a pair of wooden sandals. The Palliyarai is surrounded by inner corridors. There is a fifty-five feet tall Flag mast at a distance of 50 feet from Palliyarai. And in north of flag mast there is a Unpanpurai. Here, they cook the food and distribute it to the devotees.
There is a common well some 300 meters from the main Pathi. Akilathirattu Ammanai states that all the eighteen castes take baths from that well. It was considered sacred to bathe in and to drink the water from that well. Then there found a Paal Kinaru, in the extreme east, Vatakku Vasal in the north and Sivaye Medai, which is also called Karuda Medai in the west of Palliyarai. Then all these were surrounded by outer corridors. There is a bell tower above the spot where Vaikundar performed the Thavam.
According to Ayyavazhi legends, Ayya Vaikundar, an incarnation of Lord Narayana, carried out his Thavam at Poovantanthoppe, attracting many followers from across India. On his pass-away Ayya Vaikundar was believed to be interred there, and the square-shaped ‘Pathi’ was constructed enveloping him. The holy book Akilathirattu Ammanai of Ayyavazhi refers to the temple as “Thoppuppathi”. As per Akilam, Ayya Vaikundar incarnated from the Sea, and after providing rules and regulations to God-heads, came to Detchanam (Swamithope) and performed Thavam for six years in the place which was now known as Vada-va-mugam in Swamithope. Then when the Kalineesan came to arrest him he went once again into the sea at Muttappathi and after that (in Tamil called the Vinchai), he returned Swamithope, from where he was arrested.
Then after his trial he was carried in a Vahana by his devotees to Swamithope where he incinerated the evil spirits and unified the Seven Virgins with himself. Then after the marriage with the deities in Ambalappathi he returned to Swamithope. According to Akilathirattu Ammanai, Swamithope is the only place Narayana (Vaikundar) slept after the incarnation. Then he send 700 families to Thuvayal Thavasu to Vakaippathi and organised festivals and celebrations. And after all the Avathara Ekanais he attained Vaikundam and his physical body was interred in the place which is now the Palliyarai of Swamithope.
Kodiyettru Thirunal:
The main celebration of Swamithope includes Kodiyettru Thirunal, which was celebrated thrice in a year during the Tamil months of Vaikasi, Aavani, Thai. It starts with Kodiyettru (flag hoisting) and ends on the eleventh day with Car procession. People from different parts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala take part in this festival.
Thiru Eadu Vasippu:
Then the Thiru Eadu Vasippu, the Seventeen-day festival, in which the whole contents of Akilathirattu where read melodiously. It was celebrated during the Tamil month of Karthigai, the month at which it was written by Hari Gopalan Siddhar.
Nittham Thirunal:
As per the instructions in Akilam, the Swamithope Pathi conducts daily festival (i.e.) every day is considered as a festival day. So, the ritual practices conducted during festival days are conducted here throughout the year, though not in a grand scale as during the other festivals. The daily Panividai starts very early in the morning. Every day, around 3:00 A.M the Payyans and the people staying at the temple go to Muthirikkinaru and take a holy bath. Then, they return to the Pathi and start the Panividai. The Payyan chant Ukappatippu, and the devotees repeat it. Then, they open the door of sanctum sanctorum. It is considered sanctifying to witness this scene with the sounding of a dozen temple bells and conch. Then, there is the Vahana pavani.
Vahana pavani comes around the temple and along the four car streets, first through the Santhana Veethi and then through Ratha Veethi. The Nithiyapal is prepared daily and offered to Ayya Vaikundar ritually. It was the only food Ayya believed to be ate when in human form at Swamithoppe. This offering is done daily. The descendants of Podukutty, the first Pattathu Ayya of Payyan dynasty, prepare this daily at the Pathi. Thavanaipal, a gruel prepared with rice and green gram, is distributed to the devotees. The Noon Panividai starts around 11 O’ clock. Daily Ucchipatippu is chanted. The devotees will repeat it and Thavanaipal is distributed to the devotees. One Sundays, large number of people from far and near come over here to participate in the Ucchipatippu.
In the evening, Panividai starts around 5 O’ clock. The door of the sanctum sanctorum is opened amidst the sound of the temple bells and Conch. Then, the Payyan would chant Ukappatippu. Those followers who congregate for the evening Panividai would repeat this. Then, there will be vaahana Panividai. The Vahana is taken around the temple as well as the four car streets. After this, there will be Annadharmam. This is the daily routine of Swamithope Pathi. One can have a worship at any time of the day in this temple.
Ayya Vaikunda Avatharam:
The most important festival is Ayya Vaikunda Avatharam, the day at which Ayya Vaikundar incarnated from the sea at Tiruchendur. Though many worship centers including other Pathis conduct celebrations during this festival, it is considered sacred to visit Swamithope on this day. So, on this day Swamithope will get populated with the nationwide Ayyavazhi followers. This is the largest festival conducted in Swamithope Pathi. Several processions were held on that day which starts from different places including Thiruchendur and Thiruvananthapuram and ends at Swamithope.
This Pathi lies northern most to all other Pathis within Pancha Pathi. Swamithope Pathi is located at about 14 Kms from Nagercoil, 10 Kms from Kanyakumari, 7 Kms from Suchindrum, 35 Kms from Colachel and 96 Kms from Thiruvananthapuram. Kanyakumari Railway Station (10 Kms) is the nearest Railway Station and Thiruvananthapuram is the nearest International Airport.

The Thiru Eadu Vasippu is conducted during the Tamil Months of Vaikasi, Avani and Margazhi. The Vaikasi festival lasts 10 days while the Avani and Margazhi festivals last 3 days each.
The land where the Thangal stood today was owned by Sankaran Thamby, Shanmugam, Thiruvananthapuram until 1940s. The legend goes that Chellan Samiyar, was a palmyra climber. He being a staunch devotee of lord Vishnu, had set a pedestal at his hut and used it to offer his daily prayers. He was said to be instructed by Lord Narayana in his dream to construct a Temple. Samiyar, who was then a teenager, was unable to realize his dream as he had no land of his own. Disappointed by this, he appealed to Lord Narayana that how he could construct a temple without any land. He was said to receive command to make all the arrangements and that the land would be made available when it was time.
Meanwhile, Sankaran Thamby received a dream the following day in which a Pandaram (mendicant) ordered Thamby to offer land for a Temple to Chellan Samiyar, whom he did not know. Though Thamby ignored the dream initially, after he and his mother received repeated dreams in the following days, he came to Thiruvattaru to find the person to whom he was to donate the land. He found Samiyar and the land was donated in 1944. The current Temple was constructed in 1959 C.E. and inaugurated by Pattathu Ayya Krishnanama Mony.
The Temple is located at about 7 Kms from Marthandam, 1.5 Kms from Thiruvattaru, 8 Kms from Thirparappu, 14 Kms from Thuckalay, 22 Kms from Colachel, 27 Kms from Nagercoil, 48 Kms from Kanyakumari and 52 Kms from Thiruvananthapuram.

Manalikarai Azhvar Krishna Swamy Temple is a Hindu Temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu located at Manalikarai, a small village located in the southern part of ancient Travancore state, presently under Kanyakumari district of Tamilnadu in Kalkulam Taluk. The area comes under Padmanabhapuram division in Kalkulam Taluk in Kothanallur Panchayat. The Malayalam name Manalikkara was very popular during the Travancore state rule and after the reformation of Indian states in 1956, this place is more known as Vazhikkalampadu and it became the part of Kanyakumari district of Tamilnadu.
This place belonged to constituency of Princely Travancore State in 1235 AD. The Inscription about Taxation was written in a pillar in front of the Manalikkara Alwar Temple in year 410 ME during the rule of Venadu ruler King Veera Ravi Kerala Varma. The place Manalikkara has its influence as one of the branch of Travancore royal family in Kalkulam in 1610 AD. Raja Sri Illaya Rama Varma from Venadu was from Manalikkara branch of the family in Kalkulam.
Years ago, this temple was known as “Manalikkara Thiruvannur Azhvar Temple”. Azhwar’s are the followers and core devotees of Lord Vishnu. The Kulasekhara Azhvar who had been the 9th Azhvar from Kerala ruled Travancore during 800-825 AD. The presence of Manalikkara Alwar temple is mentioned in the “Manalikkara inscription” during the year 410 (ME). The re-installation of deity is happened by year 411 ME.

This temple is believed to be found before 411 ME Kollavarsham. The temple main deity is Krishna (Vishnu). The full structures of the temple are made up of long granite stones. This temple is believed to be constructed around 700 years ago. This construction is similar to other old temples in Kanyakumari like Thiruvattaru Adhikesava Temple and Vellimalai Murugan Temple.
Although it was part of the Travancore state, the style of construction shows similarities with Tamil style. The Manalikkara inscription issued by the Venadu king Ravi Kerala Varma (AD 1215-1240) was written in 1236. It shows the king’s keen interest in ensuring people’s welfare. The inscription says that while fixing the tax rate for tenant’s exemptions should be given in times of crop failure.
The Manalikkara Azhvar Sree Krishna Swamy temple is managed by Tamil Nadu Devasom Board under Tamilnadu Government. This is one of the temple in Tamilnadu follows the Kerala style of tradition and culture. The Major temple festival is conducted by April–May of every year.

On Rohini Nakshatram day the “Kodikayataam” (flag hoisting) is carried out in the morning represents the begin of Utsavam which would be followed by another nine days of functions.
The ten days of Utsavam is auspicious and covered with special pujas in the morning and evening. Elephant procession is carried out in the temple all the day. In the late evening, cultural programs like Nadakam (Drama), Kathakali (Traditional art), Bale (Dramatic dance), Ottanthullal etc. are conducted. The ninth day of Utsavam, late in the evening the custom called “Palli Vetta” is carried out on the belief that Lord Krishna is on his way for Vetta (hunting). The tenth day function is a “Aaraat Mahotsavam” during which the Lord Krishna is on elephant procession to the place called Valliyatumugham.
The procession starts by 4 pm is accompanied by different traditional melas, vadhyas and full of devotees. The whole procession is completely colorful with the presence of traditional instrumental performances like Panchari melam, Chenda melam, Singari melam and other folk artistic performances like Theyyam, Puli Kali etc. The procession would reach to a place Valliyatumugham at 11pm night followed by poojas on the valley of the river and final dip bath in the Valliyar river.
Thereby lord Krishna finishes the Aaarat and the procession would be returning to Manalikarai temple. Once lord Krishna is back from Aaarat (holy bath), the last tribute was the Kodiyirakkam. This is the symbolic end of the 10 days Utsavam followed by “Vedikette” (bursting of crackers) to show and notify the pleasing end of Utsavam.

Although the exact origins of the temple are not known, it is believed the temple was worshipped for more than 1000 years. The Nagamman (The Snake Goddess) temple and the centre lamp post are the only structures remaining from the original temple. There are broken remains of baked mud statues around the temple. These remains tell us that the temple was worshipped by many devotees during those days.
During the early days of the complex, the entire area was covered with wild bushes and trees. Devotees had to make way through the bushes to reach the temple. The Nagamman temple itself was fully covered with bushes. Later, the complex was cleared of these bushes. The current temple complex was built in 1981 and the first Amman Kudai Vizha (annual celebration of the Devi) was conducted on 9 November 1981 (24th Aippasi 1157 of Tamil Calendar).
The Nakshatra on this day was Revathi. Thereafter, every year, celebrations are conducted on the month of Aippasi on the day of Revathi Nakshatra. There are three main buildings in the temple: the renovated Nagamman temple, the Amman Temple (built in 1981), and Shiva Maadan Temple (built later), which houses the deity Boothathan. The Temple complex consists of the main campus, which houses the main deities, and the surrounding area.
These areas also hold bases for some deities, a spring (ootrukuzhi) where fresh water flows year-round, the temple pond, rocks and trees. The pond is also known as Irumpudayaan Kulam. Legend tells that iron was melted and poured into this pond. The temple is currently maintained by the Elur Chetty community.

Note: Pujas performed on Tuesday, Friday and Sunday is believed as Special.
Sabarimala for Women:
Mandaikadu Bhagavathy Amman Temple is known as a Sabarimala for Women. The 15 feet tall anthill is the Bhagavathy Amman. Women visit the temple with the Irumudi (a bundle containing puja items for the Goddess) as men go to Sabarimala.
Shankaracharya attained Samadhi here: 
His Holiness Sri Shankaracharya was performing Srichakra Puja with his Kerala disciples here. One day the Chakra did not turn back after the puja was over as usual. The Acharya stayed here itself and attained Samadhi. It is on this spot where the Srichakra existed, the anthill began to grow. It is believed that this idol is increasing in size by every year. Children playing this side and hitting the anthill were injured. Marthanda Varma, the king of Kerala came to know of these developments and built a temple and performed pujas regularly. Gradually, the temple assumed significance among the devotees. Today is a famous temple blessing the devotees.
Growth of Sand Hill:
Few boys who were playing with a palm fruit dropped it inadvertently on the hill. Immediately blood began to ooze from the hill. Scared by this turn of events the children ran to bring the elders to the spot. The elders believed that this was Bhagavathy who was guarding the area and began lighting a lamp daily at the temple. Soon one day there was an incident. A few people were entering the village at midnight. Knocking at the doors of the villagers, they asked them to provide them some food as they were very hungry. The villagers however, were not very hospitable and directed them to the temple nearby to find their own food.
Dusk was fast approaching and the village was on the fringes of a dense jungle on the coast. So, the people were scared. Still they went to the temple and said “Mother please give us some food.” Miraculously they heard a voice that said “go take a bath and return, you will get food.” They dutifully did what they were told and Bhagavathy is said to have fed them herself. After a sumptuous meal, they slept in the temple premises. The next morning when they woke up they had a vision of the goddess smiling benevolently at them. Immediately, they left several valuables they had brought with them in a sack and left. Meanwhile the King of Travancore had a vision of Bhagavathy in his dream. She told him to build a temple for her with the money left by the travelers.
Next day the king visited the place which had appeared in his dreams and fulfilled the wishes of the goddess. However, as he began construction of the temple, the sand hill continued growing in size. They had to demolish the temple twice because of its gaining height. So, the king implored the goddess not to grow in height. But the goddess said that it would not be possible. However, she said that she would grow only the size of a grain each year. It is believed that to this day the sand hill is growing in height each year.
Folklore of Velu Thampi:
There is a folk history that Velu Thampi, a minister of Travancore, took over the temple from a local Nayar Tharavadu at Colachel, after a tussle, and the then Karanavar cursed him and killed himself, later Velu Thampi himself driven to the same fate after his fights with the British. The takeover of Hindu temples by the state ensued during the British times in Travancore later

Muppandhal:
In Tamil literature, there are many poetesses with the name Avvaiyar. One of them lived during the Sangam period and was a close friend of the Kings, Pari and Athiyaman. She wrote 59 poems in Purananuru. The other Avvaiyar was a contemporary of Kampan and Ottakkoothar. She was the elderly figure most familiar to Tamil people. There is a traditional story that Avvaiyar had arranged for a marriage or the daughters of Sangavai and Angavai, daughters of King Pari near Aralvaimozhi to which she invited the sovereigns of the Chera, Chola and Pandya kingdoms. The kings erected pandals in the respective places allotted to them and this event led to the place being called Muppandhal.
Mother Esakki appeared in the dreams of an Old Devotee:
In a place called Panagudi of Tirunelveli district a lady devotee was greatly suffering due to unbearable stomach ache. Though she consulted many doctors nobody was able to cure it. Then she thought of her clan Goddess and shouted crying “Amma (mother)”. That night in her dream her clan God Esakki Amman came, sat neat her and massaged her stomach and asked her, “I am now below a cactus plant. Can you not build a thatched shed for me?” and then vanished. The pain of the lady vanished and she ran to the temple of her Clan Goddess and she saw the mother Goddess in the Idol form made of stone below a cactus plant. The villagers immediately built a thatched shed for the Goddess immediately. Fame of the Temple reached to several devotees and devotees improved the thatched temple to a stone built Temple.
Story of incarnation of Lady Prostitute to take revenge on a Priest:
There was an ancient temple of Lord Shiva in a nearby village called Pazhavur. Priest of the Temple developed relation with a Prostitute of the village. She being a great devotee of Lord Shiva, protected her virtue by being faithful to only the priest. When the priest lost all his wealth, the other prostitutes were trying to get her separated from the priest. The priest who was interested in getting back all his wealth murdered the Lady Prostitute, near a cactus bush. The lady’s elder brother who saw her dead also died there itself and the priest who tried to escape was bitten by a snake and he also died.
The Prostitute girl and her brother to take revenge were born as a Yaksha boy and girl called Neelan and Neeli and lived in Chozha kingdom. When the people found out that they were not human beings, they ran away from their residence and reached a Cactus bush. The brother turned in to a neem tree and the girl lived under that neem tree. The priest was born as a merchant and when he came once near the cactus bush, she created a baby, followed him and told people that he had cheated her and when he came back with her, she killed him near the cactus bush.
During that time Avvaiyar told her that her mission is over, she can stay near the cactus bush itself. When Lord Shiva, the friend of Yakshas took pity on Neeli and requested Goddess Parvathi to help her, the Goddess gave her the great power called Veera Shakthi. From that time Neeli was known as Esakki started protecting the villages nearby. Cactus shrub and Neem Tree can be still see even today. People call that place as Adhi Moola Sthanam (The ancient sanctum). There is a goddess statue made of baked clay is still there. People who want to be blessed with children keep cradles at the mandapam at the Aadhi Moola Sthanam.

The devotee is all happy even at the darshan of Perumal here. He/she is blessed with child. Also, the devotee gets back the money lent to others and standing overdue. Devotees perform Tirumanjanam to Perumal and mothers and offer vastras.
Kandu Ullam Magizhndha Perumal:
The legend has that, when Ravana caged Sita, she had the strong hope that Lord Sri Rama would certainly come and rescue her. With a view to offer them clues, she dropped her jewels on the way and one such place was Padagacheri. Padagam means anklet. Lakshmana confirmed that it was the anklet of Mother Sita. When Rama asked how he could be so sure, Lakshmana said that he used to worship the feet of his sister-in-law every day and that he knew it was her anklet. Seeing the anklet Rama was happy and this seeing and being happy also is one of the reasons of Perumal being called Kandu Ullam Magizhndha Perumal (Kandu – Seen, Ullam – heart, Magizhndha – Happy). As Padagam (anklet) fell here, the place came to be known as Padagacheri.
Padagacheri Ramalinga Swamigal:
Padagacheri village was the home of an enlightened soul Ramalinga Swamigal. Ramalinga Swamigal, a mendicant, whose mission was to renovate temples and build new ones. Padagacheri Mahan, as he is referred to, would visit every house in the village and collect money for this purpose. Endowed with healing powers, he is said to have cured people of many ailments. His name is associated with the massive annadhanam that he would organize on full moon days and during festivals.
A mutt is built at the place and Annadhanam-feeding the poor – is grandly celebrated on the Aadi Pooram day in July-August being his Samadhi day. It is noteworthy that even in those days, when basic facilities were not available, he fed more than one lakh people. His Jeeva Samadhi is in Thiruvotriyur near that of Saint Pattinathar.

The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Thevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanmars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. It is considered as the 17th among the Devara Paadal Petra Sthalams located in Thondai region. The temple has three daily rituals at various times from 6:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and four yearly festivals on its calendar. Brahmotsavam festival during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May – June) is the most prominent festival celebrated in the temple.
The temple is open from 6.00 a.m. to 11.00 a.m. and from 4.00 p.m. to 8.00 p.m. As the security of the temple resides within the temple campus, devotees can worship the Lord any time.
Those facing problems in marriage proposals, vision troubles pray to Lord and Mother for remedy. Those having no hold in life, depressed, suffering due to lack of developments in professions are advised to pray to Lord sincerely for a paradigm shift in life. To those concluding that life is but utter dark, Ambica shows the light and instill in them self-confidence. Lord and Mother in this temple drag them from despair. Hence, the temple is greatly praised as Nambikkai Koil – Trust Temple. Devotees perform abishek to Lord and Mother with honey offering Vastras.
Sundarar, an 8th Century Tamil Saivite poet, venerated Oondreeswarar in ten verses in Thevaram, compiled as the Ninth Thirumurai. As the temple is revered in Thevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 275 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon. This is the 17th Devaram Paadal Petra Shiva Sthalam in Thondai Nadu.
The temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed three times a day; Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m, Uchikalam at 12:00 a.m & Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: Abishekam (sacred bath), Alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and Deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for Oondreeswarar and Minnoli Ambal.
Unlike other Shiva temples, anointing with oil is not performed in the temple. There are weekly rituals like Somavaram (Monday) and Sukravaram (Friday), fortnightly rituals like Pradosham, and monthly festivals like Ammavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, Pournami (full moon day) and Sathurthi. Brahmotsavam during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May – June) is the most important festivals of the temple. Masi Mahasivarathri in February-March, Aipasi Annabishekam in October – November, Tirukarthikai in November – December are the other major festivals celebrated in this temple.
Oondreeswarar:
Saint Sundarar married Paravai Nachiyar in Tiruvarur. He also married Sangili Nachiyar in Thiruvottriyur who was a staunch Shiva devotee and promised her that he won’t leave her. Lord Shiva was witness to the marriage and the promise. Sundarar breached his promise and proceeded to Thiruvarur. While he was crossing the borders of Thiruvottriyur, he lost his vision. He understood that he was punished for violating his promise and appealed to Lord Shiva. Lord did not respond to the prayer.
Sundarar proceeded to Tiruvarur facing all struggles and came to this place on the way and repeated his appeal to Lord for vision. Lord Shiva kept mum but Sundarar was unrelenting. He asked the Lord whether he was really there and if so “give me my vision.”  Lord, though sympathized with his fond devotee, gave Sundarar just a walking stick (Oondru in Tamil) saying that he was there only and he could proceed with the help of the stick. Hence he came to be known as Oondreeswarar.
Sundarar demanded that the Lord should grace him as a friend but the Lord was unyielding. Sundarar became angry and argued with the Lord loudly but in vain. In a fit of anger, Sundarar threw the walking stick granted to him which hit the right horn of Nandhi breaking it. Sundarar proceeded sadly towards Kancheepuram. In this temple, Sundarar holding a pole adjacent to Nandi with the broken horn are found.
Minnoli Ambal:
Mother Minnoli Ambal was ready to accompany blind Sundarar struggling to walk with his stick but Lord Shiva prevented her from doing so.  Indicating this event, we see the left leg of Mother in a forward motion.  Mother told Sundarar that life goes in accordance with one’s good or evil deeds.  “Though you have lost your vision now, you will regain it shortly with the grace of the Lord” She assured Sundarar. She guided Sundarar on his way to Kanchipuram from this place, Parvati appeared as a lightning in front of him, giving the name of Minnoli Nayagi (Minnoli indicated lightning in Tamil). Hence, Mother is worshipped as Minnoli Ambal and Kanivai Mozhi Nayaki – Mother with assuring words.

Guru peyarchi and Pradosham are also observed regularly.
As divine cow Kamadenu worshipped here, prayers offered here bring 100 fold benefits to the devotee, according to Puranas. Almost prayers are for profitable farm yields. Devotees perform abishek to Lord and Mother and offer pudding-Pongal as Nivedhana. Prayers offered by people work wonders for those who are honest in their life even if they face severe problems in public life in a society which is surrounded by corruption everywhere. 99 percent of people reduce their faith when more problems are on the way due to their previous karma and less than one percent pass those tests to get a good and healthy life with wealth by putting more faith in divine power.
Daksha’s Olam:
Another, legend is Daksha who conducted Yagna in a grand scale without inviting Lord Shiva; the purpose of Yagna was to prove his superiority over Lord Shiva. Though he married off his daughter Dakshayani (Sati Devi) to Lord Shiva, his animosity against the Lord remained the same. He invited all the Gods and sages for the grand Yagna except Lord Shiva. Dakshayani without the consent of Lord arrived at the Yagna and was regrettably, not well received with due honor and was insulted. Consequently, Dakshayani sacrificed her life in the Yagna fire. Lord Shiva sent Veerabhadra a self-manifestation to punish Daksha.
Finally, when Daksha is annihilated and his head was replaced with a goat’s head. Daksha realized his mistake and prayed to Lord Shiva to pardon him. Lord Shiva advised him to go the river bank and asked him to invite Lords Vinayakar, Mahavishnu and Brahma to witness his prayers. On Thakkan’s request, Lords Vinayakar, Mahavishnu and Brahma came to witness his prayers. Since Thakkan’s head had been replaced with that of a goat, his prayer sounded like the bleating of a goat like huge cry (“Olam”). Hence this place is called as Daksha’s Olam – changed to Thakkolam. These prayers are called “Chamakam” and each line ends with syllable “may”. Pleased with his prayers, Lord Shiva blessed him with salvation (Moksham).
Theenda Thirumeni:
Another legend is that Goddess Parvathi returned to this place after having been insulted at her father Daksha’s yagna. She is believed to have installed a lingam made of sand here. Once she was performing her penance, this region was inundated by flood water. To protect the lingam, Goddess Parvathi embraced it. This is evident from the markings that can still be seen on the idol. Since this Lingam is believed to have been embraced by Goddess Parvathi, it is not touched by human hands. Poojas are performed by the priests without touching it.
Theerkathar, Son of Sage Udhadhi got relieved of his curse here:
Theerkathar was born to Sage Udhadhi the brother of Jupiter (Guru) and Mamata. Theerkadha one day saw divine cow Kamadenu near his hermitage. He requested the cow to be with him for conducting a yagna. Kamadenu said that it could not oblige him without the permission if Indira. The sage cursed the cow to become an ordinary and average animal losing its super powers. The cow in turn cursed the sage to be engaged in menial jobs. Sage Udhathi was sad to see his son doing menial jobs. He came to this place as advised by Maharshi Naradha and worshipped the Lord. Lord Shiva advised Sage Udhathi to perform penance on Nandhi and perform abishek to him with the water springing from Nandhi.
It’s believed that the spring from Nandhi is Ganges and Lord Jalanatheeswarar is also referred as Gangadheeswarar. The sage got his son Theerkathar rescued from the curse. Kamadenu too worshipped here by pouring the milk on the Lord and was restored to its original form and power. The Lingam worshipped by the Sage Udhadhi is in the northern side of the temple as Gangadheeswarar temple and opposite to the temple is Ganga Theertha Kulam.
Worshipped by Kamadenu:
Kamadenu, the divine cow, is also believed to have worshipped the lord here by pouring milk on the lingam. She was relieved from Theerkathar curse and got back her original form and power. On knowing this, Lord Indiran is believed to have come to Thiruvooral and taken her back to the celestial world.
Water flowing out from the Mouth of Nandhi:
At the behest of sage Uttandi, Nandi brought the river Ganges to this place. In the olden days, it was designed in a way that water would come out of Nandi idol and flow around the Shiva Linga idol; it would reach another Nandi idol and come out of its mouth to ultimately reach the river ‘Kallaru’.
Chandran got relieved of his curse here:
Thakkan gave all his 27 daughters to marry Chandran. After marriage, he showed interest to only one wife Rohini and the rest he ignored. Thakkan got wild and cursed Chandran with deadly skin disease. Chandran worshipped in this temple and after taking bath in the Ganga Theertha Kulam he was relieved out of the curse.
Demon Thakkan:
One more legend is that King Sivathithan who ruled Thiruvural was troubled by demon Thakkan. The King prayed to Lord Shiva of this temple who instructed Goddess Kali to destroy the demon. Goddess Kali executed the orders of Lord Shiva. For this reason, there is a separate shrine for Goddess Kali at the border of this place. This shrine attracts a large number of devotees. It is believed that since Thakkan cried loudly before being killed by Goddess Kali, this place got the name Thakkan Olam – Thakkolam (Olam meaning crying loudly).
Sthala Vriksham:
Another reason why this place is named “Thakkolam” is that the sacred tree of this temple is also called “Thakkolam” (Pottu).

https://www.bharattemples.com/vilvanatheswarar-temple-thiruvalam-vellore/,"Vilvanatheswarar Temple, Thiruvalam, Vellore
This town as is today, was a gateway to the north, during the period of king Rajaraja Cholan. During the same period, the area comprising present day Chittoor to Hosur was called as Thondai Mandalam, which was ruled by Vandhiya Thevan / Vallavarayan Vandhiyaththevan. The town Thiruvalam as is known today was actually Thiruvallam, as the Temple Deity Vallanathar was the family deity of Vandhiya Thevan Vallavarayan. Just outside the Shiva temple, is the Samadhi of the great saint who was known as Thiruvalam swamigal. It is inferred that the temple of Vilvanathar dates prior to the Tanjore Brihadeeswarar Temple.
This temple remains open from 6.30 AM to 12.00 PM morning and 4.00PM to 8.00 PM in the evening.
On all full moon days, special poojas are performed to the Shiva lingams in the Kanjan hill. The event of Lord Shiva granting “mukthi” to the demon Kanjan is celebrated in a grand manner on the 10th day of the Tamil month of Thai (January-February). On this day, the procession idol of Lord Shiva is taken to Kanjangiri (a nearby hill). Other important festivals celebrated in this temple are – Brahmotsavam in the Tamil month of Panguni (March-April) and Theerthavari in the Neeva river on Masi Makam day (February-March).
Consuming the prasadam here bestows the devotees with wisdom and progeny. It also relieves the devotees from skin problems and laziness. As Lord Shiva is named Vilvanatheswarar, Vilwa leaves are offered as Prasad.  Consuming the Prasad, according to faith, relieves devotees from dullness and skin problems and ensures child boon and wisdom. Devotees perform abishek and archanas to Lord and Mother and offer Vastras.
Swayambu Lingam:
According to legend, in ancient times this region was densely covered with Vilva trees. It is believed that once, a few locals had noticed a cow pouring its milk on a particular ant-hill every day. After clearing that place, they found a Swayambu lingam and built a temple around it.
Lord Shiva ordered Nandhi to Kill Demon Kanjan:
Another legend associated with this place is that when the temple priest used to bring water for Pooja / Abishekam, he was being troubled by a demon (asura) called Kanjan. The priest complained to Lord Shiva about his troubles and on hearing his plea, Lord Shiva instructed Nandhi (his mount) to kill the demon.
Nandhi executed the lord’s order and killed the demon. It is said that Nandhi tore the demon into eight pieces and these eight parts fell in eight different places – Lalapettai (skull), Seekarajapuram (head), Maveri (chest), Vadakal (right leg), Thenkal (left leg), Maniampattu (wrist), Kugayanallur (intestines), Narasingapuram (nerves) and Maruthampakkam (thorax). Later, in all these places Shiva temples were constructed.
Seeking absolution for his sins, the demon Kanjan pleaded to Lord Shiva. The lord answered his pleas and his request for pardon and granted him “Mukthi”. The lord also blessed him by saying that wherever his blood had fallen, a Shiva lingam would appear. Even today one can see hundreds of such Shiva lingams on the nearby hill. It is also believed that if one digs anywhere on the hill, he can find a Shiva lingam.
Since the lord instructed the Nandi to safeguard this temple from the demon, the Nandi idol at this temple is seen facing away from the lord and looking towards the nearby hill (Kanjangiri). The legend of Nandhi fighting with the demon Kanjan is depicted in a sculpture in the hall (Sabha Mandapam) and also in the form of reliefs chiseled on the hall pillars.
Story behind the name of Neeva River:
It is believed that since Lord Shiva found that the temple priest was struggling to bring water from the nearby river, he called the river to come near his temple. The river changed its course and started flowing near the temple. Since Lord Shiva called the river to come near to his temple (“nee vaa” meaning come here in Tamil), this river is now called Neeva.
Mukthi Sthalam:
Another legend related to this temple is that once a person was on his way to Kasi to dissolve a relative’s ashes (“Asthi”) in the Ganges. Since Thiruvalam was a famous pilgrimage centre in the past, he decided to take some rest here and he kept the ashes near the temple tank. When he decided to resume his journey, he was surprised to see the Asthi changed to jasmine flowers. He proceeded to Kasi as planned and after reaching there, another surprise awaited him – the jasmine flowers had again changed back to ashes.
Since he found that the Thiruvalam temple had changed the ashes into jasmine flowers, he decided not to dissolve the ashes in the Ganges, but instead bring it back to this temple and dissolve it in the temple tank itself. This temple is considered as holy as Lord Visvanatha temple in Kasi. This temple is also referred to as a Mukthi Sthalam (a place to attain salvation). 
Theekkali Vallam:
It is said that Lord Shiva was worshiped by a demon (asura) called Theekkali, so this place is also known as Theekkali Vallam.
Adhi Sankara pacified Mother here:
Earlier the temple was called as Theekkali Vallam. The Ambal’s name of this temple was known as Theekkali Ambal (Jadaakalaabambal) and she was adorned an angry look. The Sthala Puranam says that Sri Adhi Sankara calm down the Ambal.
Thiruvalam:
It is believed that Lord Ganesha and Lord Subramanya had a quarrel for a mango fruit offered by Sage Narada. A contest was conducted that whoever goes around the world first and comes back here would be offered the fruit. While Lord Subramanya went around the world, Lord Ganesha encircled his Parents and got the fruit as a token of appreciation. Valam in Tamil means circumambulation. This is the place where Lord Vinayaka established the truth that “world” means Father and Mother and “Father and Mother” mean world.
He went around his Divine parents to show this truth. As he did the Valam here, the place came to known as Tiruvallam and changed as Tiruvallam. The famous competition between Vinayaka and Subramanya took place at Thiruvalam contrary to another version that states that the competition took place at Kailasam. ‘Thiru’ means ‘Sacred’ or ‘Holy’ while ‘Valam’ means ‘Circumambulation’. Here the Vinayakar is called “Kani Vangiya Vinayagar” (the lord who received the fruit).
Lord Mahavishnu worshiped Lord Shiva here:
As Lord Mahavishnu worshiped Lord Shiva here, his footprint is kept for worship in front of the flag post.

Sarpa Nataraja:
Kolli hills was ruled over by ‘Kolli Mazhavan’. His daughter was bitten by a snake. He treated medically to save his daughter life and found no way. At last he gave up his hope and left her at the temple step and started praying the lord. Saint Tirugnanasambandar came to this place during his pilgrimage and found the girl suffering. The king explained to the saint the sick story of his daughter and begged him for remedy.  Saint Sambandar sang ten verses (Pathigam) in praise of Lord Nataraja with “Thunivar Thingal” as the first line.
As he completed each stanza, he sang “Mangai Vaada mayal seivado ivar maanbu” (“மங்கையை வாட மயல் செய்வதோ இவர் மாண்பு”) which means is it right to make this lady suffer?). Lord felt so happy and started to dance for his song, and brought back the snake and made it to take back its venom. Based on this event, Lord Nataraja appears here with his hair tied and dancing on a serpent. He is praised as Sarpa Nataraja. This is a rare darshan of the Lord.
Mother married Lord Shiva here:
Once a business man and a Shiva devotee called Kamalan was childless. One day when he was going home from the temple he heard a child crying and found a baby in a lotus flower. He named her Amalai and brought her up. When the child was ready for marriage, he wanted her to be married to his brother-in-law. Amalai was a great devotee of Shiva and so wanted to marry Shiva. Shiva came to their house as Kamalan’s brother-in-law and married Amalai.
After the marriage, they both left the house saying that they are going to the temple. After they left, original brother-in-law returned home, only then they realized something had happened. They went to temple in search of Amalai and knowing this, Amalai threw her anklet back and it turned to be a river and started flowing. This river came to be known as Silambu river but its name was later changed to Panguni river. Amalai was Parvathi Devi herself and Shiva and Parvathi Devi gave Dharshan to all the people on the Rishaba Vahana.
Mattru Urai Nathar:
Saint Sundarar used to get gold from Lord Shiva to feed and maintain Shiva devotees following him. After worshipping the Lord in Tiruvanaikkaa, he came to this temple and sang in praise of the Lord seeking gold. Lord Shiva kept mum. Angry Sundarar sang another Pathigam (ten verses) in a loud voice questioning whether there is one called Lord Shiva. Sundarar got the gold. Yet he was doubtful about its purity and was closely looking at it. Two men came there and asked the saint why he was looking at the gold. Sundarar sought their help in the valuation.
One of them confirmed the purity of the metal while the other approved it. Both disappeared instantly. Sundarar sang again saying that he did not mean to doubt the Lord. Lord appeared before him and said that he alone was the assessor and his companion was Lord Vishnu. Hence the Lord is named Mattru Urai Nathar – God who confirmed the touch of gold – Mattru means the touch of the gold.

With significance to the visit and prayer of the sage, Lord is named Pranava Vyagrapureeswarar.
Lord Shiva gave Moksham to a Hunter:
According to the legend, a hunter once was chased by a tiger. Afraid that the tiger will kill him, he climbed a Vilva tree and stayed there throughout the night.

In olden days, Sastha, as a guardian deity was here on a stone-peeta under the Poolathi tree. People of the place named him as Poola Udaya Kandan Sastha and erected a small temple for him. A yogi came to this place, worshipped Sastha and stayed here for some time and attained Samadhi (salvation) here. On his tomb, an ant-hill came up. People began worshipping this ant-hill erecting a tall wall and began to worship the wall itself. As the devotees felt a Shiva aspect on the wall, named it Yogeeswarar and continued worships. As there was a Puttru (ant-hill) where the Yogi was in the past, the place is named in Puttrur which later changed as Putheri.
The Temple covers area of about one acre. There are shrines for Yogeeswarar, Nayinar. Poola Udaya Kandan Sastha and Bhoothathan in the Temple. There is a hall for doing Vazhipadu. The Temple doesn’t have tower, flag post and other structures attributed to normal temples. There is a 22 feet tall wall in the open space. On the top of the wall there is a form as if a Yogi is lying. Poola Udaya Kandan Sastha is in a separate shrine. He is in the form of a Peeta (a seat) and his idol is behind this seat.
The temple is open from 6.30 a.m. to 7.30 a.m. and 6.30 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. During other hours, the devotee can worship the Lord from outside also.
Chithirai New Year, Guru Pooja for Yogeeswara, Vaikasi Visagam and Panguni Uthiram are festivals celebrated in this temple with much fanfare. On all Saturdays in the Vazhipadu hall, Bhajanai are held. On the Panguni Uthiram day in March-April, Yogeeswara is taken in procession on a horse. On the Friday following the Panguni Uthiram in March-April, the walls are painted with red sand. A festival called Kan Thirappu – Opening the Eyes- is celebrated in the evening that day.
The sand on the wall being worshipped as presiding deity is offered as Prasad to the devotees. Consuming a little of the Prasad with water would bless the devotee with a child, is the faith. Those blessed carry Kavadi to Yogeeswarar wearing saffron clothes. Rice is offered as Nivedhana during the daily puja to the Lord. Special pujas are performed to Lord Yogeeswara and Sastha on Vaikasi Visakam (May-June) day, when a Nivedhana prepared from mango, jack fruit raw rice and sugar named Mambal (Mango milk) is offered to the Lord.

The temple is open from 4.00 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. and from 5.00 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.

Devotees pray in the temple for relief from the adverse aspects of serpent planets. Devotes perform abishek to Nagaraja with milk and offer milk porridge – Paal Payasam – Nivedhana. They also install Naga idols in the temple campus. The Prasadam here is the sand from the ground in the sanctum of Nagaraja. The red color of the soil is said to be due to the blood shed from the idol when it got struck by the sickle. The soil that is given as   ‘Prasadam’ has medicinal properties capable of curing skin ailments of the devotees.
Nagercoil Nagaraja is believed to bless the childless couples. If the couple come to this temple and pray with sincere faith and devotion, soon their request for a kid will be answered. Several childless couples are reported to have admitted that they were blessed with children after their visit to this temple. To get rid of ‘Sarpa Dosham’, besides worshiping the snake stone images in the temple, devotees offer stone images of 5 headed snakes in silver to the temple and participate in a puja ritual called   ‘Noorum Palum’. This will relieve them of the bad effects of Ragu and Ketu.
Naga Worship:
Worship of Serpents had been there across all parts of the world since ancient times. Snakes had been worshiped by Hindus, Buddhist, Jains for ages. Even in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, Rome, the worship of Snake had been in vogue in ancient period. The Egyptian king had the symbol of cobra’s hood in his crown, even their Gods and Goddesses. (e.g. Osiris). There are similar instances from Babylon and Mesopotamia. Greece worshiped snakes as god for protection. They believed that the slain soldiers will be reborn as snakes.
Even its believed that Athens was guarded by a snake in 5th century BC. It is also their national symbol. In Ancient Rome, people believed that while felling a tree, if a snake is killed, its considered as bad omen, and God also moves out of that place. Australians and the Mayans also worshiped Snakes. Excavations in Mexico have lots of pots and utensils with Snakes symbol embossed on them.  In Africa Pythons are being worshiped even today and they worship it as God for Knowledge.
In India worship of serpents is there from pre-historic period. In U.P, Naga Panchami is observed even now. In Punjab, people draw pictures of Snakes on the wall and worship. In Bihar, ladies take fast for 3 days and worship Serpent God. In West Bengal, Manasa Devi is considered as the head of all Serpents. In a place called Subramanya in Karnataka, Snake is the worship deity. In Andhra in Laepakshi, there is a 6 feet high snake idol that’s worshiped.
In Kerala, worship of Cobra is of paramount importance. There are close to 16,000 temples (Sarpakkaavu) in Kerala, across all villages. Prominent among them are Manaarshaala, Vettikaadu, Paambummekaatu mana. In Manaarshaala, even today, a lady remains as Spinster, throughout her life, and does daily puja for this deity. In Tamilnadu, in Thiruverkadu, Devi is believed to have appeared initially as Cobra. In Tiruchengode, there is a 60 feet long cobra statue for worship. In Nagercoil, a temple is dedicated exclusively for Nagaraja. The name of this town is named after this temple only.
If we look at Valmiki Ramayana (episode 67, sloka 46-49), its mentioned that Nagas lived in Mahendragiri mountain area (20kms from Nagercoil) and worshiped Serpent god. Nagas are children of Kashyapa and Kadru. Among the prominent Nagas of Hinduism are Manasa, Sesha, and Vasuki. The Nairs of Kerala and the ethnically related Tulu people of Coastal Karnataka are clans which are believed to have originated from the serpent dynasty.
Legends says that the Nagas also carry the elixir of life and immortality. Garuda once brought it to them and put a cup with elixir on the ground but it was taken away by Indra. However, a few drops remained on the grass. The Nagas licked up the drops, but in doing so, cut their tongues on the grass, and since then their tongues have been forked. Nagas are snakes that may take human form. They tend to be very curious.
According to traditions, Nagas are only malevolent to humans when they have been mistreated. They are susceptible to mankind’s disrespectful actions in relation to the environment. They are also associated with waters — rivers, lakes, seas, and wells — and are generally regarded as guardians of treasure. They are objects of great reverence in some parts of southern India where it is believed that they bring fertility and prosperity to their veneration. Expensive and grand rituals like Nagamandala are conducted by Tuluva’s in their honor.
The prominent of Nagas in the Puranas are;
Ashta Nagas:
The eight revered Nagas are referred as Ashta Nagas they are Shesha, Vasuki, Takshaka, Karkodaga, Shankhapala, Gulika, Padma and Mahapadma. It is said about the colors of Nagas that Vasuki is pearl white, Takshaka is red, Karkodakan is black with 3 white stripes in his hood, Padma is pink as lotus with white streak and coral ornaments, Mahapadma is white with trident mark in head, Shankhapala is yellow with white streak in hood, Gulika is red with crescent mark in hood.
Origin of Nagaraja Temple:
It is believed, it was established by a senior member of the Nampoothiri Brahmin family of Kerala -‘Paambummekaatu Mana’ of ‘Mala, Trissur. The Nampoothiri consecrated a Nagaraja image in his residence after he had a vision of Vasuki, the head of snakes. Whoever came to his place with skin related problems, presumably caused by Sarpa Dosham – ill – effects of snakes as per horoscope were cured. Once the Nampoothiri priest visited the palace of a Pandya king on his request and cured his skin problem which happened to be leprosy, using his mystical power.
On his way back to Kerala, in the place where Nagaraja temple stands now, he saw a peasant woman quite upset over an incident in which her sickle had just hit the head of a Nagaraja stone idol hidden in the ground covered by bushes, etc. Surprisingly blood was oozing out of the idol. The place used to be a wooded area then. The learned Nampoothiri pundit realized it was five headed Nagaraja idol with enormous power.
Without wasting time, with help from the local community, in the same place he consecrated the Nagaraja idol with consent from the local ruler, which later became the famous Nagaraja temple of Nagar Kovil. Initially the temple was a hut with thatched roof. Responding to yet another vision he had during his sleep, he finally consecrated the Nagaraja idol in the same place where it was found and the idols of Shiva and Vishnu were consecrated in the new structure which became Sanctum Sanctorum or Srikoil.
The temple rituals and pooja protocols being followed here are based on Kerala tradition as this part of Tamil Nadu was under the control of Travancore princely ruler prior to 1956. The main tantri is from Kerala from the Nampoothiri family of Paambummekaatu Mana’ of ‘Mala, Trissur. Because of dispute over the puja rights, in this temple, the tantric rights are bestowed for alternative years only. One year for the tantri from Thiruvalla Illam and next year it will be tantri from Paambummekaatu Illam. This system is followed at present. The temple has been under the management of Tamil Nadu Devastanam since 1956.
King of Kalakad:
Once the King of Kalakkad, who was stricken with leprosy, came to the temple on Sunday in the Tamil month of Avani and did penance before the deity. Miraculously, he was cured of the disease, and the fame of the temple spread far and wide. The king built the present temple in gratitude. On every Sunday during Avani (August/September) the king, accompanied by his wife and children, used to visit the temple and offer poojas. Ever since, the temple is visited on every Sunday in Avani by thousands of devotees and the serpent shrine is worshiped.
Cobra saved Marthanda Varma:
In mid-18th Century, King Marthanda Varma of Venadu kingdom (South Travancore) had lot of enemies. One day he was taking rest in the South side building of the temple. Knowing this, his enemy went up to kill him. His sword missed target as he was interfered by a cobra in between. The king woke up in the meantime and caught his enemy. From then on, the South Entrance is called as Maha Meru Maaligai.
Jain Belief:
Once upon a time, a pair of Snakes lived in this place. Mahibalan killed them. During death, they were listening to the chanting of Parsvanatha. By virtue of that, they got rebirth as the King and Queen of Snakes in the underworld. Later, a Gandharva named Samwaran was travelling across the sky. He was disturbed by the chanting of Parsvanatha. So, he made heavy rain fall to submerge him. The king cobra (Dharnendra) raised its hood over Parsvanatha and protected his tapas from the rain. As rain continued, water level raised. To prevent Parsvanatha from sinking, the Queen Cobra (Padmavathy) became a Lotus flower and gave seat to Parsvanatha. Samwaran couldn’t succeed in his effort.  People can see 2 huge snake statues in the temple, depicting this story.
No report of Cobra Bite:
A fascinating fact about this temple is there are several cobras moving here and around the temple prescient and so far, there has been no report of any cobra bite what so ever. No report of bite in the adjacent areas as well.

One of the unique aspects of Thanumalayan Temple is the presence of many gods from the Hindu pantheon and the different sects like Vaishnavism including Rama and Krishna to more localized Tamil traditional worship of Amman/Devi and Kandan or Muruga. The temple is rich in sculpture and architecture and a visitor to this temple is amply rewarded with the sight of such exquisite art of hundreds of years old. The town along with Kanyakumari was part of Travancore. It became part of Tamil Nadu in 1956. Non-Hindus are permitted inside the temple but photography is prohibited.
There are two important festivals, one in Margazhi (December/January) and the other in Chittirai (April/May). During the Margazhi festival, on the 9th day the deities are taken out in procession around the streets on three festival cars. The 10-day Car Festival celebrated in this temple during between December and January every year attracts crowds of thousands of people. Another festival known as Theppam is celebrated during between April and May every year.
Prathana Sthalam for marriage, children, longevity and prosperity needs.
Worship of Lord Anjaneya of this temple for physical and mental health.
Suchindram:
As per legend, Indra got relieved of a curse here. The term “Suchi” in Suchindrum is believed to have derived from the Sanskrit meaning that stands for “purify”. The place purified Indra from his curse. Hence it got the name Suchindrum. Accordingly, Lord Indra is supposed to visit the temple for performing “Ardhajama Pooja”, or worship, at midnight every day.
Story of Anusuya, wife of Sage Athri:
Anusuya, the wife of Athri Maharishi was famous for her chastity and her devotion to her husband – an embodiment of a Hindu wife. She could perform miracles by sprinkling the ‘Paatha Theertham’ (water with which she washed her husband’s feet) to bring rain to a parched earth or to transform objects to her desire. When the three Devis, – Goddesses Lakshmi, Saraswathy and Parvathy (Adishakti) heard through Sage Naradha the powers of this earthly woman they wanted to test her chastity. They approached their husbands, Lords Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva to test Anusuya’s devotion to her husband. The three Moorthys transformed into three old mendicants and went to the hermitage where Anusuya was living and sought alms from her. When Anusuya was about to serve them food they told her that they had taken a vow whereby they could not accept alms from a person wearing clothes. As it was a sin to refuse alms to mendicants she prayed to her Lord and sprinkled a little ‘Paatha Theertham’ on the three old beggars. They were all immediately transformed into babies and throwing off her clothes she offered them food.
The Goddesses learning what had happened pleaded with Anusuya to grant them ‘Mangalya Bhiksha’ (gift of married life) and to give them back their husbands. Anusuya showed them the three babies. The Devis ran to the cradle and picked one baby each. Anusuya then prayed to her Lord to restore them back to their original form. Lord Sri Vishnu was in Lakshmi’s embrace, Siva in Parvathy’s lap and Saraswathy with Brahma. They accepted that Anusuya’s fame as the chaste woman on earth was justified. Thus, the Trimurthy came to be represented by the Lingam at Suchindram; the bottom represents Brahma, the middle represents Vishnu and the top Shiva.
Indra got relieved of his curse here:
There is another lore associated with this temple. Once Indra was infatuated with Ahalya, the wife of Rishi Gautama. One night he came to the hermitage where Gautama was living and made a sound like a cock indicating the approach of dawn. Rishi Gautama thinking that dawn was imminent awoke from his sleep and went to the river for his ablutions prior to commencing his prayers. Realizing that it was too dark for dawn and too early for morning to break he returned to his hut. In the meantime, Lord Indra took the physical appearance of Rishi Gautama, approached Ahalya and satisfied his desire.
Rishi Gautama returning from the river was enraged when he saw his wife in another man´s embrace and cursed the man’s entire body be covered with ‘yoni’ (the female organ) and his wife Ahalya to become a statue of stone. Lord Indra to get rid of this curse went to Gnanaranya and prayed to the three Moorthys to rid him of this curse. When he was rid of his curse and transformed into his original form he built a temple and installed the Lingam to represent the three Moorthy – Thanu – Maal – Ayan, and the name of the place came to be known as Suchi-Indran (the place where Indran was purified).
Narada foiled Lord Shiva plan to marry Devi Kanyakumari:
Narada Lord Siva started from this place to wed Kanyakumari Amman, but returned when he heard the cockcrow made by sage Narada. Thus, successfully foiling the plan, the Goddess Kumari resides here as a virgin, unable to marry Lord Shiva.
Agnipariksha:
Another story of note about Suchindram Temple is the age-old practice of Agnipariksha that was practiced here up until the 1860’s, when it was forbidden by the government. This ritual could only be engaged if the king gave his consent, and then it was done on a designated date. The ritual involves Kaimukkal, or ‘dipping of the hand’, in which any Namboothiri, or a high caste Brahmin who was under threat of excommunication due to immoral behavior, had to prove his innocence. A small silver ox statue was placed in a copper vessel of boiling ghee. The accused Brahmin had to reach in and pull the figure out of the ghee. A complex ritual followed in which the hand was bandaged, and the Brahmin taken to the home of a senior man, who watched over him. On the third day his hand was unwrapped. If the fingers were black and burned, the Brahmin was excommunicated, and pushed to the fringe of society. If his honor was vindicated, and the hand was normal, he was returned to his post, given gifts from the king, and all due respects were given to him by the temple community. One can only imagine the level of integrity required of Brahmins who faced such a method of oversight.

Aappanoor:
King Cholandhagan was a staunch Lord Shiva devotee. During his reign, the land was fertile and prosperous with timely rains. Farm yields were plenty. His subjects were happy. All this was due to his devotion to Lord Shiva. He went on hunting on a day. As he could not succeed in chasing a deer, he felt fainted at last. Shocked attendants offered food and water to the king to recover from the weakness. The king said that he could not afford to take food before doing his usual Shiva Puja. There was no Linga for the puja.
A wise minister fixed a wooden piece (Aappu) on the ground as Shivalinga and suggested that he can worship and take his food. The king believed the minister, worshipped the Aappu and ate his food. He found then what he worshipped was not a Shiva Linga but a piece of wood fixed on the ground by his minister. He cried to the Lord that if he was indeed his devotee, Lord should come into the Aappu and accept his worship. Lord appeared on the Aappu and became Aappudayar. The place came to be known as Aappanoor.
Anna Lingeswarar:
During the period of another king Suguna Pandya belonging to the same dynasty, the place faced a severe famine. Yet, the priest of the temple grew some grains with difficulty and was offering the Nivedhanas to Lord. Seeing this, people grew angry on the priest and harassed him for his feeding the Lord while people were starving. The priest fell at the feet of the Lord for help. Lord asked the priest to follow him with his wife and set on his Rishaba to another place. He stopped at this place – Aappanur. As Lord stopped here on his Rishaba – Idaba in Tamil, this also came to be known as Idabapuram. The priest used the sands of the Vaigai River to cook the Nivedhana for Lord. By the grace of Lord, the sand became rice-Anna. This event brought the Lord the name Anna Vinodhan / Anna Lingeswarar.
Punyasenam becoming Kubera by the grace of Lord Shiva:
Punyasenam in the lineage of Lord Brahmma was a staunch Shiva devotee. As advised by Sage Agasthya, he performed severe penance on Lord Shiva to become as wealthy as Kubera. Pleased with his penance, Lord Aappudayar with Mother Sugantha Kundalambikai granted darshan and the boon he sought. But as fate had it, he became immediately arrogant and cast a mischievous look on Mother and lost his eyes and fell dead. Merciful Lord Aappudayar gave back his life and called him Kubera. Since then, he became the Lord of North with two wealth – Sanga Nidhi and Padhma Nidhi.

The original complex is believed to have been built by Pandyan Empire, while the present masonry structure was built during the Nayak during the 16th century. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. This temple is erected to commemorate the victory of Saivites over Jains and to emphasis that Shiva is the greatest God of all. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 6:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and four yearly festivals on its calendar. The Muthu Pandal festival is celebrated during the day of the Magam (February – March) is the most prominent festival.
The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Thevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the Nayanmars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The temple is closely linked with the history of Saivite Child Saint Thirugnana Sambandar and is praised in his Thevaram hymns. This is the 248th Devara Padal Petra Shiva Sthalam on the banks of river Vaigai and 4th Sthalam of Pandya Naadu. Thirupugazh, the work of Arunagirinathar, a 13th-century saint glorifies the temple.
The temple is open from 6.30 a.m. to 12.00 a.m. and from 4.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.
As people perform remedial prayers and pujas in Tirumananjeri for removal of obstacles in marriage efforts, devotees do it in this temple also. They offer garlands to Mother Elavarkuzhali and take to their homes. They worship the garland and perform pujas for 48 days to realize the wedding wish.  After marriage, couple come to the temple and offer prayers to Ambica. Devotees offer vastras to Lord and Mother and contribute for the renovation of the temple.
The temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed six times a day; Kalasanthi at 6:00 a.m., Irandam Kalm at 9:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m, Irandam Kalm at 7:30 p.m., and Arthajamam at 9:00 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), Alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and Deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for Edaganathar and Elavarkuzhali. There are weekly rituals like Somavaram (Monday) and Sukravaram (Friday), fortnightly rituals like Pradosham, and monthly festivals like Ammavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, Pournami (full moon day) and Sathurthi.
Sambandar’s miracle is celebrated every year as Edu Ethireriya Utsavam remembering the event of the palm leaf of Gnanasambandhar floating against the current of Vaigai River on Aavani Avittam Star day combined with full moon day during the Tamil month of Vaikasi. Sankabisheka, performed during Karthikai (November – December) is considered very sacred in the region. The Muthu Pandal festival is celebrated during the day of the Magam (February – March) is the most prominent festival.
Chithirai Tamil New Year day falling almost on April 14 or a day before or after occasionally in some year; Vaikasi Visakam in May-June; Lord Nataraja Tirumanjanam on Aani Uthiram in June-July; Special abishek to Ambica (Poopunitha Neerattu) on Aadi Pooram day in July-August; Karthikai Deepam in November-December; Margazhi Arudra darshan in December-January, Masi Float festival in February-March and Panguni Uthiram in March-April are the festivals celebrated in the temple.

Thiruvedagam:
Pandya kingdom with its capital at Madurai was under the rule of Koon Pandian (hunchback Pandiyan) then. Those were the days when Jainism was dominant in the kingdom with political support – king’s support. Saivism and Shiva worship were almost routed out. Child Saivite Saint visited the city in such a situation. This created a fear in the minds of the Jain monks. They set fire in the camp of the saint to eliminate him. Knowing their evil design, Gnanasambandhar sung 10 verses directing the fire on the king who was their support then. The effective verses had their impact on the king affecting him with severe burning small pox boils in the whole body.
The Jain monks did their best with the mantras they knew, but in vain. The king appealed to people to help him in his distress. All merciful Gnanasambandhar came to his palace, sung a Pathigam-10 verses- beginning with line “Mandhiram Avathu Neeru” meaning the best Mantra is the sacred ash on the Body of Lord Shiva, brought the ashes from the kitchen of Mother Meenakshi Amman temple and applied it on the body of the king. The small pox disappeared miraculously immediately even with any of symptoms. King began to think of the glory of Saivism.
The Jains, shaken by the incident said that it was witchcraft work of the saint and challenged him to a contest and vowed that they would leave Madurai if defeated. The contest was that both will write a verse and place it on the floods of Vaigai River. The victor will be the one whose song leaf swims against the current and reaches the banks. If lost in the current, they will be the loser. Jains wrote the verse beginning with the lines Athi Nathi. Sambandars’ verse began with “Vazhga Andanar, Vanavar Aaninam”. Jains leaf was washed away. Sambandar continued his song Vanniyum Mathamum and the verse leaf reached the shores establishing the Might and Glory of Lord Shiva.
Yedu in Tamil means the palm leaf used for writing in those days. The place where the Yedu reached the shore came to be known as Thiruvedagam. Vaaduvenra Vinayakar here is said to have stopped the movement of the palm leaf in the guise of a fish, in response to Sambandar’s patikam. The palmyra leaf which the Samanars left was swept away by the river and reached ‘Thirupasethi’ (Thiru + pa + Serthal) later to be known as Thirupachetty.
Sattainathar Adhishtanam:
There is still a controversy about the place where Sattainathar Siddha attained Samadhi. Seven places claim this honour. During his visit to Thiruvedagam, he saw Shivalingas scattered on the way and was afraid to tread on the way. Boys in the place use to simply carry him to the temple. He changed the river sands into some useful things and offered them to the boys. Sattainathar and his followers used to put the sacred ash in the water soaked rice (Neeraharam in Tamil) and cured stomach aches. Following this example, even today people use to bring the water soaked Neeraharam to the Sattainathar Adhishtana (Samadhi), place it on the Linga there and consume it for stomach problems. On the new moon day in the month of Aadi – Aadi Amavasya in July – August, Guru Puja is dedicated to Siddha.
Seshanur:
As per local legend, the place was called Seshanur as Adisesha, the serpent snake of Vishnu worshipped Shiva and later went on the become Edakam.
People worshipped Lord Shiva here:
Shiva here is believed to have been worshipped by Garuda, Adhiseshan and Vishnu.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th–9th centuries AD. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines uphills. The temple has a five-tiered rajagopuram at the top of hill, while the temple tank is located opposite to the temple, outside the main entrance in the foothills. As the presiding deity, here is Lord Narasimha the place could have been known as Simhapuram and as it was in the Chozha country it might have got the name of Chozhasimhapuram.
One who visits this temple and stays here for 24 minutes is said to attain moksham. The temple follows Thenkalai tradition of worship. Six daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Karthikai festival during November – December, Brahmotsavam during the Tamil month of Chittirai (March – April), and Narasimha Jayanti during Vaikasi (May – June) being the most prominent.

Dodda Acharya and the Sholinghur – Kanchi connection:
The Sholinghur Narasimha Koil has been managed and taken care of by the descendants of Dodda Acharya for the last several centuries. Dodda Acharya was the grandson of Muthalai Andaan and to him, it is said, goes the credit of creating this beautiful temple town of Sholinghur in the Arcot region of Tamil Nadu. Dodda Acharya used to visit the Garuda Sevai of Varadaraja Perumal at Kanchipuram every year. However, once he could not make his annual trip to Kanchi as he fell ill. Saddened by this, he bathed at the temple tank at Sholinghur, invoked the blessings of Varadar of Kanchi and sang 5 songs in praise of Lord Varadaraja Perumal.
So, pleased was the Lord with his devotion that he is believed to have provided darshan to Sholinghur Dodda Acharya from his Garuda Vahanam. In memory of this event, every year on the third morning of Brahmotsavam at Kanchi, the temple door is closed for a few minutes and Lord Varadaraja Perumal, in his Garuda Vahanam, says ‘I am now going to give darshan to Dodda Acharya of Sholinghur. The Lord waits at the entrance of the temple, faces the direction of Sholinghur and provides darshan to Dodda Acharya. This is called the Dodda Acharya Sevai in Kanchipuram.
Prarthana Sthalam:

If one takes a dip in the holy tanks here and goes around the two hills they can achieve many things in life. The circumambulation of the two hills has been classified under two heads.

The temple is open from 6.00 a.m. to 12.00 a.m. and from 4.30 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.
Vaikasi Thiruvadirai in May-June, 13 day Rajarajan festival and Vinayaka Chaturthi are the festivals celebrated in the temple. The Nambiyandar Nambi (Vaikasi) festival, sponsored by the Thiruppanandal Matham witnesses the chanting of the Thirumurais. Other festivals include Navaratri and Skanda Sashti.
Lord grants all that the devotees wish. Devotees perform abishek to Lord and Mother offering new vastras.
Polla Pillaiyar:
Nambi Andar Nambi, who collected and saved the sacred Thevaram hymns from pests and edited them, while young, was watching his father offering Nivedhanas to Polla Pillayar – Vinayaka. He wanted to know whether the Lord would accept only the nivedhana offered by his father and not his. The time came to Nambi to take charge of the priesthood of the temple. He offered Nivedhana to Pillayar and insisted him to consume the offer. But Pillayar was silent and Nambi began to weep. He dashed his head at the feet of Vinayaka and cried. Pleased with his Bhakti, Vinayaka accepted the Nivedhana of Nambi and consumed it.
King Rajaraja Cholan did not believe this miracle and came with different Nivedhana and asked Nambi to offer it to Lord Vinayaka. Pillayar was smilingly silent. Nambi sang the Irattai Mani Malai hymns with a touching prayer. Polla Pillayar ate the Nivedhana in the presence of all. The indebtedness to Nambi by the Saivite devotees is endless as we would have lost the treasure of our Thevaram Bhakti literature to pests but for the painstaking efforts of Nambi. The idol of Nambi and king Rajaraja also are in the temple.
Thirunaraiyur:
Sage Durvasa known for his temperament was on an intense penance to have the darshan of Lord Shiva. A Gandharva from the celestial world caused hindrance to Rishi’s penance. The Rishi cursed him to become a Narai-crane. He also refused to accept his apology and suggest a relief. The Gandharva appealed to Lord Shiva for relief. Lord said that he would be relieved of the curse if he performed abishek to him with Ganga water fetched each day from Kasi. As a bird, he flew to Kasi each day as fast as he could, fetched Ganga Water in his mouth, performed abishek and got the relief. As Narai the crane bird was granted salvation here, the place is named Narayur – Thirunaraiyur.
Nambiyandar Nambi:
This Shivasthalam is famous for the shrine of Polla Pillaiyar who blessed a small boy by name Nambiyandar Nambi with divine knowledge. According to legend, the Chola King First Rajarajan was informed by Polla Pillaiyar the whereabouts of Thevara Paadal. Even though Thirunavukkarasar, Sambandar and Sundarar composed the Thevara Pathigams during 7th to 9th Century AD, the inscriptions of the same were lying buried inside Chidambaram Temple. Chola King First Rajarajan with the help of the blessed boy Nambiyandar Nambi saw to it that the Thevara Paadal were recovered and preserved. Apart from what were destroyed by white ants, the remaining Thevara Paadal (Pathigams) were indexed and arranged in proper order and what we know today of Thevara Paadal were thus recovered from destruction by the blessings of Polla Pillaiyar, whose shrine inside Tirunaraiyur Shiva Temple is well known.
The credit of compiling and classifying this colossal collection of Tamil Thirumurais. He compiled the works of the 3 saints into the 1st through 7th Thirumurais; Manikkavacakar’s Tiruvasagam & Thirukkovayar into the 8th. He included Thiruvisaippa and Tiruppallaandu in the 9th & Tirumular’s Thirumanthiram in the 10th. Tirumukhappaasurm and other works were included in the 11th Thirumurai. With the aid of a descendant of the musical Nilakanta Yaazhpaanar he assigned and fitted Panns to the Thevaram Hymns, (after worshipping Shiva at Erukkattampuliyur). Nambi is also credited with several other literary and devotional works.

This temple remains open from 6.00 AM to 11.00 AM in the morning and 5.00 PM to 7.30 PM in the evenings.
Amongst others, Surya Pooja in the Tamil month of Chithirai, Brahmotsavam in the Tamil month of Chithirai, Maha Shivarathri in the Tamil month of Masi, Thiruvathirai in the Tamil month of Margazhi and Annabishekam in the Tamil month of Aippasi are celebrated in a grand manner. 
This temple is a Parihara Sthalam for people suffering from problems relating to eyesight. Sincere prayers have seen many a devotee have his/her eyesight improved or restored, even in recent times. Devotees also pray to Lord Shiva here for the removal of hurdles from marriage proposals, to attain knowledge and wisdom. After the fulfillment of their prayers, the devotees perform Abhishekam to the Lord and offer new clothes. They also donate their munificence to the temple renovation.
Surya penance on Lord Shiva:
The legend is that Dakshan (father of Goddess Parvathi) once performed a yagna where he invited all the devas (celestial gods) but intentionally left out Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva was angered by this slight and all the devas who attended the yagna and consumed the yagna-food (avirbhaagam), became the object of his fury. Lord Shiva instructed Aghora Veerabhadrar to go to Dakshan’s yagna-hall and punish all the devas.
Agora Veerabhadrar carried out the lord’s instruction and as a result the Sun God (Suryan) who was one of the attendee lost his eye sight and lustre. To seek Lord Shiva’s forgiveness, Suryan went to several holy places and offered his prayers. It was finally at this place (Puravaar Panangkattur) that Suryan’s eye sight and his brightness were restored. Hence, Lord Shiva is also praised here as “Kan parithu aruliya kadavul” (the God who took and later restored the eye sight).
As Suryan got back his brightness at this temple, it is believed that every year, he worships Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvathi for a period of seven days from the 1st day of the Tamil New year by illuminating the idols in the two sanctums i.e directly on the lord as well as the Ambal bathing them from top to bottom as he transits from morning to evening. So, all sannidhis of the temple face east.
King Sibi’s sacrifice:
One day, Indra and Agni wanted to test him and appeared before him in the form of a vulture and dove. When the vulture chased down its prey to eat it, the dove sought refuge in the lap of King Sibi. Sibi requested the vulture to let go of the dove. The vulture refused as he was hungry and asked the King to let go of his rightful meal. The King asked the vulture if he would be satisfied with flesh equal to the weight of the dove to let go of it. The vulture accepted. The King asked for a pair of scales, and without hesitation, sliced a portion of his thigh and placed it on the scales to equal the weight of the dove.
It is believed that Goddess Parvati (Satyambigai) was pleased with King Sibi’s sacrifice and righteousness and gave him moksha at this palm grove (Panangadu in Tamil) which is why it was called ” Puravar Panangattur” in ancient times. The later Cholas are said to be descendants of King Sibi which was why they assumed the title of “Sembian” and rightfully they have built a beautiful temple at the spot associated with King Sibi.
Puravaar Panangaatoor:
To distinguish it from the other holy places, this was named ‘Puravaar Panangattur’ since it was surrounded by thick woods (puravu: grove, wood / forest). As this holy place was enclosed by the woods of Mullai region, the place is called ‘Puravaar Panangaatoor’.

Kalikamba Nayanar:
Kalikamba Nayanar is a Nayanar saint, venerated in the Hindu sect of Shaivism. He is generally counted as the forty-third in the list of 63 Nayanmars. His hagiography speaks about how he cut the hand of his wife, who did not help in serving a Shaiva, devotee of the god Shiva. The primary account of Kalikamba Nayanar’s life comes from the Tamil Periya Puranam by Sekkizhar(12th century), which is a hagiography of the 63 Nayanmars. Kalikamba Nayanar was born and lived in Pennagadam also known as Tirupennagadam. In Kalikamba Nayanar’s times, Pennagadam was part of the Chola kingdom.
Kalikamba was a Vaishya, the merchant caste that flourished in Pennagadam. He was a devotee of Shiva and used to serve the devotees of Shiva (Shaiva’s). Every day, he welcomed them, washed their feet, and worshipped them. He also served lunch to the devotees and offered them money and gifts. Once, when the devotees gathered for lunch at Kalikamba’s house, he started with his daily ritual of pada-puja (washing of feet to show respect) of the devotees. His wife helped him in the service. The wife would pour water from the pot, as Kalikamba washed the feet. When Kalikamba was about to wash the feet of a devotee, she recognized the devotee as their former servant and hesitated from pouring water from the pot.
Kalikamba felt that the wife has desecrated the sacred service. He took the pot from her hand and cut off the hand by his sword. He continued to wash the feet of the devotees and served them food, a duty generally performed by his wife. For his act of devotion, he attained the grace of Shiva. The tale of Kalikamba Nayanar is also recalled in the 13th Century Telugu Basava Purana of Palkuriki Somanatha with some variation. The devotee is recognized the son of their servant Mallandu or Malla. He had refused to serve Kalikamba and left Kalikamba’s house and become a Shaiva mendicant.
The wife refuses to serve a son of a slave and advises her husband not to do so, however Kalikamba considers every Shaiva as a manifestation of Shiva and refuses to pour water to wash his feet. Kalikamba considers this as an insult of Shiva and cuts both her hands as a punishment. Pleased with his dutifulness, Lord Shiva restored his wife’s hands and blessed both of them with salvation. Hence the lord here is also praised as “Sri Kaivazhangeesar” – (in Tamil “Kai” means hand and “Vazhangu” means to give). Kalikamba Nayanar receives collective worship as part of the 63 Nayanmars. Their icons and brief accounts of his deeds are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. Their images are taken out in procession in festivals.
Pralaya Kaleswarar:
The world was once destroyed by Lord Shiva. Barring this place, all parts of the world was submerged in water. Devas rushed to this place and begged the Lord to protect all beings by keeping them here. Lord directed Nandhi to prevent the flood entering here. Nandhi, till then facing Lord Shiva, turned the other side to swallow the waters of the great deluge and saved the place. Hence, Lord of the place is praised as Pralaya Kaleswarar – Lord who protected the world. He destroyed and also protected. Nandhi, which turned the other side to protect the place from the deluge is still in the same position facing the entrance of the temple.
Pennagadam:
Indira, the king of Devas needed flowers form Earth to perform Shiva Puja in his place. He sent two maidens to earth to bring flowers, who found them in plenty but stayed here itself seeing a Shivalinga in the garden and began doing pujas. As they did not return, he sent the Divine cow Kamadenu to bring them back. Kamadenu found the maidens and only joined them in the Shiva puja by pouring its milk on the Lord. As it did not return, he sent his white elephant Iravadham in search of them.
The elephant, seeing them in worship also joined the camp by standing in such a way to create a cool shadow for the Shivalinga. Finally, Indira himself came down, saw the maids, cow and the elephant and also joined them in the worship. All returned together with the blessings of Lord Shiva. Since Virgins (Penn in Tamil), Divine cow (Aa) and Elephant (Gadam) worshipped Lord here, the name of the place was called “Penn- aa- Gadam – Pennagadam” which later became Pennadam.
Thirunavukkarasar appealed to Lord Shiva to inscribe the stamp on him with the symbol of his Trident and Nandhi:
It is in this temple Thirunavukkarasar appealed to Lord Sudarkozhundhu Nathar to inscribe the stamp on him with the symbol of his Trident (Trishul) and Nandhi (Vrushba) if he so considered him deserved for the honour. Lord honoured the saint with his own hands in all his mercy. This episode is described by divine poet Sekkizhar in his magnum opus Peria Puranam in touching devotional lines.
Lord Shiva raised the ground level to help a Chola King to worship him:
Version 1:
A Chola King had to worship the Lord from the other side of the bank of the river due to heavy floods. Lord acknowledged his worship by raising the ground level.  There is a temple within the temple, 30 meters above the ground level remembering the event. The place is referred to as Tunngaanai Maadam in scriptures.
Version 2:
Another legend associated with this temple is that of Anandvalli Ammaiyar, an ardent Shiva devotee, who used to worship the lord here regularly. Once there was a heavy flood in the river Vellaru that prevented her from reaching the temple. She decided to perform her daily worship from the other bank of the river itself. Although she completed her worship, she could not see the lord. Lord Shiva realized this and as a token of his appreciation for her devotion, he raised the ground level by about 40 to 50 feet. Even today, the shrine is an elevated position and one has to climb up some steps to enter it.
Birthplace of Kalikamba Nayanar and Meikandar:
This is the birth place of celebrated saints Kalikamba Nayanar and Meikandar, the pioneer of Saiva philosophy.
Marai Gnana Sambandar lived in this place:
Also, Saint Marai Gnana Sambandar in the Saivite Guru tradition lived here.

Thiru Manikkuzhi:
The legend of this temple involves Lord Mahavishnu and Mahabali Chakravarthy – the grandson of the celebrated Vishnu devotee Prahladha. It is believed that Mahabali was a rat in his previous birth. While eating the ghee from a lamp in this temple’s sanctum, it incidentally raised the lamp’s wicks which was about to burn out. Pleased that the rat had lit a lamp in the temple, Lord Shiva granted the rat a boon that it will be reborn in a family of asura (demon) kings. This is how Mahabali Chakravarthy came into existence. Mahabali was very charitable by nature. He would be ready to offer assistance to anyone in need of help.
The celestial gods were very jealous of him and they sought the help of Lord Mahavishnu to bring about his downfall. Lord Mahavishnu took the avatar of “Vamana Brahmmachari” to destroy Mahabali. Vamana approached Mahabali seeking three feet of land which he readily offered. Lord Mahavishnu then took his Thiruvikrama avatar and measured the entire earth with a single step of his feet. His second step covered the entire space. He then asked Mahabali what he had to offer for the third feet. Left with no other option, Mahabali politely offered his head. Pleased with his devotion, Lord Mahavishnu pushed him down towards the underworld (“Paadhalam”) and made him one of the “Chiranjeevis” – the immortals.
It is believed that Lord Mahavishnu came to this place as a bachelor (Brahmmachari), and worshiped Lord Shiva at the end of his “Vaamana Avathaar”, to seek respite from his “Brahmahatti Dosham”. Since Vaamana was of small stature and he would not have been able to see Lord Shiva face, Lord Shiva took a smaller form and appeared inside a pit (pit is called “Kuzhi” in Tamil) to enable Mahavishnu to worship him. Since Lord Mahavishnu worshipped the lord here as a bachelor (bachelor means “Maani” in Tamil) and since the lord appeared inside a pit (Kuzhi), this place is called “Thiru Manikkuzhi” (“Thiru” is a respectful prefix). The lord here is praised as “Sri Manikkavarathar”.
It is believed that Lord Mahavishnu is always worshiping Lord Shiva here. He also requested Lord Shiva that there should not be any disturbances to his worship. Lord Shiva asked one of his “Sivaganams” (guards) –  Kubera Bheema Rudra, to stay back at this place, form a protective screen and protect Mahavishnu any interference. Lord Shiva also absolved Lord Mahavishnu of his sins. It is to be noted that Pooja is first offered to Kubera Bheema Rudra to get his permission and then offered to Lord Shiva. Kubera Bheema Rudra’s image can be seen on the screen in front of Lord Shiva. This screen is closed after every Aarathi. This procedure is unique to this temple.
Lord Dakshinamurthy worshiped by the Naga Devars here:
The Sthala Puranam also says that Lord Dakshinamurthy here was worshiped by the Naga Devars and they were blessed with his discourses.
Markandeya worshiped Lord Shiva here:
It is also believed that Markandeya visited and worshiped the lord here before visiting Thirukkadaiyur.
Sthala Viruksham:
This temple’s Sthala Viruksham, Kondrai tree is very old and is said to have existed through the previous yugas.
Mythology behind Temple Structure:
The Sthala Puranam says that the four pillars in the hall (mandapam) before Lord Shiva’s shrine represent the four Vedas. In the next hall, the six pillars represent the six shastras. The 28 pillars in the corridors represent the 28 agamas.
Dharisanam of Lord Shiva can be done with the help of Priest:
This is the only Shiva temple where you cannot have dharisanam of the lord without the help of a priest. Devotees can worship the lord for a matter of 2 minutes when the screen is removed. As per the Sthala Puranam, it is believed that this 2 minutes worth of worship is equal to performing Shiva Pooja for 12 days. If this darshan happens on a Pradosham day, it is considered to be equivalent to worshiping 3 times at Chidambaram, 8 times at Thiruvannamalai and 16 times at Banaras (Kasi).
Udhavi Nayakar:
Another legend associated with this place is that Lord Shiva saved a north Indian merchant called Athri from thieves. Hence the lord here is also praised as “Sri Udhavi Nayakar” and the Goddess Parvathy is called “Sri Udhavi Nayagi” (Udhavi means help in Tamil). This place was also earlier known as Udhavi. This has been mentioned in the stone inscriptions present in this temple. Saint Thirugnanasambanthar has referred to this place as “Udhavi Maanikuzhi” in his hymn of this temple.
Surya performed Pooja to Lord Shiva here:
There is another legend which states that this temple was raised by Lord Suryan (Sun God) to perform his poojas to Lord Shiva.
Sangamam:
Gadilam River represents the grace of Goddess Mahalakshmi while Goddess Saraswathi flows in the form of the river Swetha. It is believed that Thirumanikuzhi is the meeting point of both these rivers.
Sanctum as Palliayarai:
It is believed that Shiva is always with Ambal and is guarded by Sivagana Beemaruthrar (also known as Beemangaran printed on the front screen). Hence Aarathi will be shown first to Beemaruthrar to get permission and then to Shiva. After Aarathi screen will be closed. Since Shiva is always with Ambal there is no Palliayarai in this temple.
Place of Worship:
Also, it is believed that by worshiping Shiva in this temple will be equal to worshiping of 16 times Kasi, 3 times Thiruvannamalai and 3 times Chidambaram.

Lord Shiva blessed Arjuna with Pasupatha Asthra:
Arjuna, to win the war in Mahabharata, wanted to get the Pasupathasthiram. So, he went to the forest and did meditation upon the Lord Siva. To spoil this, Duryodhana sent Moohasuran. Moohasuran metamorphosed himself into a Pig and attacked Arjuna. Lord Siva came to his rescue as a hunter and attacked the pig with his arrow and at the same time, Arjuna also did the same. But Arjuna’s bow broke and he beat the hunter with his broken bow on his head and it was felt by all the people of the world. Then Arjuna understood that he was the Lord Siva and Arjuna fell at his feet. Since the Lord Siva came as a hunter to kill the Pig, this Place has got such a name. Lord Shiva blessed Arjuna with Pasupathasthiram (missile of the Lord of the animals).

Lord Vinayaga plan to retain Vishnu Idol in Srirangam:
Vibhishana, was the younger brother of the Asura King Ravana who ruled Lanka. Lord Rama in the epic of Ramayana rescues his wife Sita, who was kidnapped and held by Ravana, with the help of Sugriva and Hanuman defeated him. In this war, the moral and truth-abiding brother of Ravana, Vibishana aids Rama in his battle against his brother. Ultimately Rama wins the war and as a token of love, he gives Vibishana a Vigraham (idol for worship) of Lord Ranganatha, a form of Vishnu.
Vibhishana, though he supported Rama, was basically an Asura, hence the Devas (who are arch rivals to Asuras as per Hindu mythology) wanted to stop this idea of an Asura taking Lord’s supreme form to his Kingdom. They request the help of the Remover of obstacles and God of learning, Lord Vinayaka and the Lord accepts the plan. Vibhishana, while on his back to his Kingdom, goes through Trichy, and wanted to take his bath in the river Kaveri and do his daily rituals.
However, he is perplexed as the deity, once kept in land, can never be removed and has to be in that place forever. As a solution, Vibishana tries to find someone to hold the deity while he was taking bath. He finds the Lord Vinayaka under disguise of a cowherd boy. As per the plan, when Vibishana is fully into water, Vinayaka takes the deity and keeps it firmly in sand, in the banks of Kaveri. On seeing this, the angry Vibhishana chases the boy, to punish him, and boy keeps running and climbs over the rock near the Kaveri bank. Vibhishana finally reaches the boy and hits him on the fore-head.
One can see a pit in the forehead of the idol even today. The little boy then reveals himself to be Vinayaka. Vibishana immediately apologizes and the Lord gives him his blessings, reveals that the idol is destined to remain in Srirangam and sends him off to Lanka. This is similar in many regards to the story of Lord Ganesha in Gokarna with Ravana in the same Ramayana period.
The place in which the Ranganatha deity was kept was later covered in deep forests, due to disuse and after a very long time, it was discovered when a Chola king chasing a parrot found the deity accidentally. He then established the Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam as the largest temple complexes in the world. Meanwhile, the Pallavas built the Vinayaka temple and the Thayumanaswami temple, in the rock which Vinayaka used to escape Vibishana.
Association with Manicka Vinayagar:
Uchi Pillayar is always associated with Manicka Vinayagar at the foothills. It is a general worship practice to pray obeisance with Manicka Vinayagar before visiting Uchi Pillayar.
Ancient Names:
This place was also known as Sirappalli, Rishabachalam & Dhakshina Kailasam during ancient days.
Tirishiramalai:
According to Hindu mythology, the city Tiruchirappalli derives its name from legend associated with the Thayumanaswami Temple. Demon Tirishira (demon with three heads) was on penance on Lord Shiva. Though many years passed, Lord Shiva delayed his darshan to test his purity. He threw two of his heads in fire and was about to throw the third, Lord appeared before him and restored his two heads. As requested by him, Lord Shiva agreed to stay here in the name of Thirisira Nathar (based on demon Tirishira story). The place came to be known as Tirishiramalai, now changed as Trichy.
Thiri Sikarapuram:
There are also stories that since there are three peaks on Rock Fort, occupied by three Gods Shiva, Parvathi & Vinayakar (Uchi Pillaiyar), the place was called Thiri-sikarapuram and later called Tirisirapuram.
Contest between Adisesha and Vayu:
A furious contest arose between Adisesha and Vayu to decide the supremacy of their prowess. The condition was to shake violently Mount Kailash.  Defeating Adisesha, when Vayu broke the mount, the top of the Kailasam was disturbed by Vayu (air) and thrown in three places and this is considered one among them and that is why this is called Dakshina Kailasam. The other two places are Kalahasthi and Tirikonamalai (Srilanka).

The Rockfort is a fortress which stands atop a 273-foot-high rock, consisting of a set of monolithic rocks accommodating many rock-cut cave temples. Originally built by the Pallavas, it was later reconstructed by the Madurai Nayaks and Vijayanagara rulers. The major complex in the temple are believed to be built during the 8th century by the Pandyan Empire. According to geologists, this Rocky Mountains dates back to 3500 billion years old. This place was also known as Sirappalli, Rishabachalam & Dhakshina Kailasam during ancient days.
Thirugnana Sambandar, a 7th century Tamil Saivite poet, venerated Thayumanavar in eleven verses in Thevaram, compiled as the First Thirumurai. Appar, a contemporary of Sambandar, also venerated Thayumanavar in 10 verses in Thevaram, compiled as the Fifth Thirumurai. As the temple is revered in Thevaram, it is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam, one of the 276 temples that find mention in the Saiva canon. Muthukumaraswamy in the temple is revered in Thirupugazh, the hymns of Arunagirinathar, a 15th-century saint. This is the 123rd Devaram Paadal Petra Shiva Sthalams and 6th Shiva Sthalam located on the southern bank of River Cauvery in Chozha Naadu.

The worship is held amidst music with nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument), religious instructions in the Vedas read by priests and prostration by worshippers in front of the temple mast. There are weekly rituals like somavaram and sukravaram, fortnightly rituals like Pradosham and monthly festivals like Ammavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai, Pournami (full moon day) and Sathurthi.

The event of Lord Shiva servicing Rathnavathi during her labour moments is celebrated on the 5th day of Chithirai Brahmmotsavam in April-May. Curtain is downed during this event. They decorate Rathnavathi with child on her lap. The curtain is then lifted for darshan offering light puja- Deepa Aaradhana. After the puja, the oil and the maternity medicine given to mothers after delivery are given to the devotees as Prasad. It is believed that pregnant women consuming this will be blessed with safe delivery.
The Karthigai festival is celebrated during the Tamil month of Karthikai, between November and December, concluding with the celebration of Karthikai Deepam. A huge lamp is lit in a cauldron, containing three tons of ghee, at the top of the Malai Kottai hills during the Deepam. To mark the occasion, the festival deity of Thayumanaswami circumambulates the mountain.
Every full moon, tens of thousands of pilgrims worship Thayumanaswami by circumambulating the Tiruchirappalli hill barefoot. The circumambulation covers the circumference around the hill, and is referred as Girivalam. On the day of yearly Chitra Pournami, the full moon of the Tamil calendar, hundreds of thousands of pilgrims come from across the world to worship Thayumanaswami.
Thayumanavar Guru Puja is celebrated in the month of Thai (January-February) on the day that the star Visakam reigns. Lord Shiva is brought in a procession on the first day of every Tamil month and on new moon days. Lord Shiva as a Swayambulinga graces devotees facing west. The rays of the sun fall on the Lord for three days in the evenings in the month of Panguni (March-April). The float festival also takes place during this period. Pujas are conducted under two codes – Shivagama and Kameekam.
Chithirai Brahmmotsavam in April-May; Panguni float festival in March-April; Aadi Pooram in July-August; Aipasi Annabishekam in October-November; Tirukarthikai in November-December; Panchamurthy procession on Makar Sankranti (Thai Pongal) falling almost on January 14 and Maha Shivarathri in February-March are the festivals celebrated in the temple.
Thayumanavar:
According to Hindu legend, a pregnant woman named Rathnavathi was an ardent devotee of Shiva. While nearing labor, she requested her mother to come over. Her mom could not reach on account of heavy floods in river Cauvery. As delivery time came closer, Rathnavathi prayed to Shiva. Shiva, moved by the devotion of Rathnavathi, took the form of Rathnavathi’s mother and helped with her smooth delivery. After the delivery, Shiva vanished and Rathnavathi’s mother who arrived later. The family came to know that it was Shiva who attended to the delivery.
Henceforth, Shiva in the temple came to known as Thayumanaswami, meaning the Lord who could act like a Mother. The temple obtained the name from the presiding deity, Thayumanaswami. Shiva disguised himself as a mother for a pregnant lady, leading to the name Thayumanavar, meaning the one who became a mother. This incident is also celebrated as a special event called “Chettipenn Maruthuvam” on the fifth day of the Chithirai Festival at the temple.
Tirishiramalai:
According to Hindu mythology, the city Tiruchirappalli derives its name from legend associated with the Thayumanaswami Temple. Demon Tirishira (demon with three heads) was on penance on Lord Shiva. Though many years passed, Lord Shiva delayed his darshan to test his purity. He threw two of his heads in fire and was about to throw the third, Lord appeared before him and restored his two heads. As requested by him, Lord Shiva agreed to stay here in the name of Thirisira Nathar (based on demon Tirishira story). The place came to be known as Tirishiramalai, now changed as Trichy.
Lord Shiva caused Sand Rain to punish Chola King:
The region was ruled by a Chola king having Woraiyur as his capital. During this time, Sarama Munivar created a flower garden here and was worshipping Lord with Sevvanthi flowers. A trader stole the flowers from this garden and gave them to the king. As the king became very fond of these flowers, he asked the trader to supply them to him daily. The trader continued his theft business. This caused disturbance to the Shiva Puja of Sarama Munivar. His appeal to the king was in vain. Munivar appealed to Lord Shiva who looked at the direction of the court of the king and caused sand rain in the place. The king realized his wrong doing, prayed to Lord Shiva and was pardoned.
Contest between Adisesha and Vayu:
A furious contest arose between Adisesha and Vayu to decide the supremacy of their prowess. The condition was to shake violently Mount Kailash.  Defeating Adisesha, when Vayu broke the mount, the top of the Kailasam was disturbed by Vayu (air) and thrown in three places and this is considered one among them and that is why this is called Dakshina Kailasam. The other two places are Kalahasthi and Tirikonamalai (Srilanka).
Shrine turned west from east:
The shrine was previously facing east. As Lord turned west to punish the king who stole the Sevvanthi flowers and caused disturbance to the puja of Sarama Munivar, the shrine stood permanently facing west leaving the flag post behind. During the puja times, the music and Thevaram recitals are followed only from eastern side behind the shrine.
Kediliappa Pillai named his son after the Lord:
One Kediliappa Pillai was the treasurer – accountant of King Vijaya Raghunatha Chokkar during his rule of the region. Pillai was a staunch Shiva devotee and was gifted with a handsome son. Pillai named him Thayumanavar after the name of the Lord. The boy showed all signs of brilliance in education and characters. The king retained him in his services. He served the king for a long time, while his heart was with the Lord.
People worshipped Lord Shiva here:
Sage Agasthya, Arjuna, Hanuman, Rathnavathi, Rama, Saptha Kanniar (seven virgins) and Saptha Rishis (seven sages) are supposed to have worshipped Shiva in this place.
Sevvanthi Nathar:
Sarama muni (sage) worshipped Shiva with Sevvanthi flowers (chrysanthemums) brought from Nagaloka, the abode of the Nagas or serpents. So, the Lord is called Sevvanthi Nathar.
Thiri Sikarapuram:
There are also stories that since there are three peaks on Rock Fort, occupied by three Gods Shiva, Parvathi & Vinayakar (Uchi Pillaiyar), the place was called Thiri-sikarapuram and later called Tirisirapuram.

Anjanam Thadavia Kandan:
In days of yore, the devotees of the place worshipped Sastha as their family deity. They made a small idol of Sastha, built a small temple and installed the idol. Later, a person with impaired vision was lying in the temple and was worshipping the Lord seeing him with the eye of the mind. He felt as if somebody was sitting by applying Kajal in his eyes. He regained his vision. Based on this event, the Lord is also known as Anjanam (Kajal) Thadavia (applying) Kandan. Kandan is the short form of Manikandan, another name of Sastha.
Yaga Gunda Theertham:
Yaga Gunda Theertham has special significance in the temple. Maharshi Athri stayed in his hermitage here with his wife Anusuya. With a view to show her chastity to her Rishi husband, the three Lords – Brahmma, Vishnu and Shiva – visited the hermitage in the guise of ascetics. When invited for lunch, the three said that they will accept her hospitality only if she serves them nude. Anusuya had no hesitation. She immediately took the water from the plate with which she performed the pada puja for her husband (washing the feet of the husband), spilled on the ascetics. The ascetic became simply infants. Stunned by her instant action, the Lords appeared before Anusuya with their respective consorts. As Maharshi Athri had his Ashram here, the place was first known as Asramam and later Asraamam. The spring created by Maharshi Athri is outside the temple, known as Yaga Gunda Theertha.
Presiding Deity is called as Adhisaya Sastha. Lord Sastha graces in the temple in quite a different form against the traditional style, keeping his right leg bent and the left toe pressed on the ground. He holds a club in his right hand wearing a necklace and the sacred thread. His curling hair is beautifully dressed. This is a form of Sastha exclusively in this temple only and nowhere in India. There are elephant and horse vahans in front the shrine.
Yaga Gunda Theertham has special significance in the temple. The spring created by Maharshi Athri is outside the temple, known as Yaga Gunda Theertha. Vilwa the sacred tree of the temple, 3 in numbers has its bunches with three, five and nine leaves. The famous Sthanumalayan temple in Suseendram is very near to this temple within a walkable distance. Madan Thambiran, Bhoodathar, Eenan, Vanniar and other deities are in the corridor.
The temple remains open from 7.00 a.m. to a.m. and from 6.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m.
Following Panguni Uthiram in March-April on the 7th and 8th day a festival is celebrated for Sastha when he comes in procession on Horse vahanam.
Those suffering from vision problems are advised to pray in the temple. Devotees perform abishek to the Lord and offer Vastras.

The temple is open from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 8 p.m and has six daily rituals at various times of the day.
We can pray for the opulence of the family and for diminishing enemies’ nuisance. The offering is done by performing the holy bath (Tirumanjanam) to the Lord and Thaayar and donning them with new clothes.
Birthplace of Peyazhwar:
The temple is believed to be the birthplace of Peyazhwar, one of the first three of the twelve Azhwar saints of the 6th-9th century AD. The legendary Azhwar was believed to have come to earth from the 60 ft. (18 m) well called Manikairavam inside the temple premises. One of the weapons of Lord Vishnu Nandakam the Sword, urged Mahalakshmi to preach the mantras. Mahalakshmi accepted on condition that the Sword must be born in the earth, worship Lord Vishnu and then she would teach.  Accordingly, Nandakam was born in the lily flower blossomed in the Manikairavam Theertham.  He was called Mahataahvayar.
He was performing the duty of garlanding the Lord every day and Lakshmi happily preached him. He came to be known as Peyalvar because of his immense bhakti to Perumal.  Pey means an elderly person. It is said that he was called so since he was the senior most Alvar.  Thirumalisai Alvar adopted him as his Guru and received his spiritual teachings (upadesam).  In the front mandapam of the Perumal’s sanctum Peyalvar is in a separate sanctum, seated and facing south.  Even now we can see the Manikairavam well where Peyalvar was born, at a distance near the temple. This was on a Dasami day (Sadayam asterism) of Aippasi in the year Siddharth of the Dwapara Yuga.
Bell Prayer:
Sage Bhrigu was in tapasya at the banks of Manikairavam Pushkarini, praying to beget Mahalakshmi as his daughter. Baby Lakshmi crawled in a flower at the pond, on a Panguni Uthiram day. He brought her up and when she attained marriageable age, the sage got her married to the Lord Himself. As the daughter to sage Bhrigu, she is called Bhargavi. She is in a separate sanctum at the right side of the Lord. Special homam is performed every Friday morning and she is worshipped with Vilva leaves by chanting the Srisuktam.
This is a very propitious time to worship Thaayar. The devotees pray to her with Vilva leaves to get relief of the impediments to marriage, to flourish in studies and remain healthy. They also worship her by placing two bells at her feet and then hang them on the door of the sanctum. The belief is that the bells ring and pray to Thaayar for their pleas. When their prayers are answered, once again they hang two more bells and thus complete their prayer and offering.
Sarva Theertham:
Chandran (Moon) worshipped this Lord to be relieved from a curse. The Lord appeared before him by making all the holy waters flood here. By taking bath in this water and worshipping the Lord Chandran got rid of his curse. The Lord asked all waters to stay back in this place. Since all waters are united and remained in the same place, it came to be known as Sarva Theertham, and because Chandran was eased out of his curse, it also got the name Chandra Pushkarini. Now, it is called Chitrakulam.
Maha Vishnu annihilated Demon Madhu here:
During Tretha Yugam, sages performed Yaagam at the banks of the Kairavini Pushkarini.  The demon Madhu disturbed them from conducting the Yaagam. The sages then, prayed to Lord Vishnu to kill this demon and allow them to perform the Yaagam.  Lord Vishnu appeared before them and promised them that he would kill the demon. He directed them to continue with the Yaagam and so did the sages. The demon came there as usual to impede their work. Lord Mahavishnu appeared from the Yaagam and annihilated the demon. Later, as per the sages request he remained in this holy place. He, in the name of Aadi Kesava Perumal now blesses us all.
People worshipped Lord Vishnu here:
Saint Bhrigu, Adhithyan, Soorya Kula King Sumanagan, Kabali and Chandran (Moon) worshipped Lord Vishnu here.
Mother gave alms to Bikshadana:
When Lord Shiva plucked the fifth head of the contumacious Brahma, the severed head got stuck in his hands. He was known as Kapali (the possessor of Kapala or skull). When Bhargavi offered grains to Brahma Kapala, the head disappeared, thereby relieving Lord Shiva of his distress. He made Mayurapuri his abode and assumed the name Kapaleeshwarar.
Kairavani Neerodai:
There was a rivulet that connected Triplicane and Mylapore several centuries ago. Since the origin of the river was at Kairavini Pushkarini it came to be called Kairavani Neerodai. The rivulet was full of fragrant flowers like lily and lotus. The other end of the rivulet was another holy pond which is now the temple tank of Lord Parthasarathy which is also called Kairavani Pushkarini.
Aadhi Kesavan:
Mention about this hallowed spot is found in Brindaranya Kshetra of Garuda Puranam. Once Mahavishnu mitigated the sufferings of Suryan who is also called Adhithyan. Since Kesavan blessed Adhithyan he is called Aadhi Kesavan. Aadhi also means first in the world. So many say this is the first.

The legendary Azhwar was believed to have come to earth from the 60 ft (18 m) well called Manikairavam to the south-east of the temple, which exists to this day in Arundale Street, though in a neglected condition. The Aalvaar has a separate sanctum in this temple.  10 days’ festival is conducted close to Aippasi Sadayam day.
Sage Bhrigu had set up a hermitage here:
According to Mayurapuri Mahatmiyam in the Brahmanda Puranam, when Sage Vyasa requested the Lord to show him the holiest of places where he could do penance, he pointed out to Madhavapuram (Mylapore) where Sage Bhrigu had earlier set up a hermitage and did penance.
Santhaana Pushkarini:
Amirthavalli Thaayar was born as a baby in the Pushkarini here on a Maasi Magam day.  Hence, the Pushkarini is called “Santhaana Pushkarini”.  It is believed that on the day she was born all the sacred waters united here.  Based on this a festival is conducted on the Maasi Magam day.  On that day alone, Thaayar along with the Lord comes to the Theertha Kulam and graces us. The belief is that by taking bath at the Theertham and worshipping Thaayar, all our sins will be assuaged and we will be blessed.
Thirukkovilur Vaibhavam:
At Thirukkovilur Lord Vishnu made the three Aalvaars – Poigai, Putam and Peyalvar come together and himself revealed to them. Based on this, during the festival the Tirukoyilur Vaibhavam when the three Aalvaars appear together and on the tenth day the celebration of the Aalvaar visiting his birthplace, the Well are performed. In this holy place, Thirumalisai Aalvaar as a disciple to Peyalvar had his spiritual teachings from him. This episode is celebrated on the fourth day of the festival.
Madhavapuram:
It is believed that Lord Vishnu came here from his abode in Vaikuntam as Madhava Perumal to marry Amruthavalli Thaayar. Hence, this place came to be called Madhavapuram.
Prarthana Sthalam:
Santhana Pushkarani, which is now found to the South of the temple was the sacred tank of Sage Bhrigu, who lived in the ashram here. The age-old belief, as referred to in Mayurapuri Mahatmiyam, is that couples who bathe here on the full moon day in the Tamil calendar month of Maasi (mid Feb-mid March) and who offer their prayers to Madhava Perumal and Amruthavalli Thaayar will be immediately blessed with children. This is also a Prarthana Sthalam for unmarried people. Offering prayers to Lord Madhava Perumal who is seen in Kalyana Kolam is said to help one find his or her match immediately.
Best place for liberation from Kali Dosham:
Lord Vishnu directed Veda Vyasa here as the best place for liberation from Kali Dosham in this Kali Yugam.
The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Ushathkalam at 8 a.m., Kalasanthi at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 7:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) & deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Madhava Perumal and his consort Amirthavalli. During the worship, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast.
There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The Theppam or float festival of Madhava Perumal Temple will be held for three days. On the first day, Madhava Perumal and Amirthavalli Thaayar will be taken around the tank. Kothandaramar will be taken around on the second day and Peyalvar on the final day. The sacred tank, also called the Santhana Pushkarini, with an area of 117×100 ft can accommodate only a small float that can carry not more than 10 people. So, only priests were allowed to enter the float. During Maasi Magam, the water from all sacred rivers of India is believed to mingle with the water of the tank of this temple. Taking a dip here on this day is considered holy.
The festival is one of the major festivals of the temple, which was not celebrated for a decade before 2011. It is believed that all the rivers converge in the tank during the auspicious day. The annual festival, Brahmotsavam, of the temple is celebrated during the Tamil month of Chittirai (March – April). In the Tamil calendar month of Aadi, Lord Madhava Perumal is seen in a sleeping posture on the lap of Andal- a special event at this temple.
Special poojas are conducted during all the nine nights of Navarathri in the month of Puratasi (mid-September to mid-October) for Mother. On the tenth day of Navarathri i.e. during Vijayadasami, Lord Perumal is carried in a procession to the main entrance. There after special poojas, the Utsav of firing bow and arrow towards the Vanni tree takes place. The blessed bow and arrow from the hands of Lord Perumal is taken and passed on to a member of the Vedhavyasapaatar Community which in is then passed on to the Locality’s Gowder who after all the necessary pooja will start firing the arrow towards the Vanni tree. After all the ceremonies, Lord Perumal is taken in a procession into the temple from where he provides vision to his devotees.
Odd numbered Saturdays of Puratasi brings prosperity. Therefore, special worships are held on all five Saturdays of the month of Puratasi signifying the austerity of the days. If the month has four Saturdays only, the last Saturday of the month of Aavani or the First Saturday of the month of Aippasi is considered as the 5th Saturday. These days brings prosperity and are treated as special occasions for the devotees who undergo a fast.
The month of Margazhi (December – January) sees a flurry of activities dedicated to Lord Perumal. Every morning during all the ten days of the Vaikunda Ekadasi Lord Perumal is taken on a procession around the temple with verses from Alvar recited invoking his blessings. On the 10th day the Lord appears along with Nachiyar in front of the Devotees. On the eve of Vaikunda Ekadasi Lord Perumal raises up to the golden gates of heaven and from there provides a heavenly vision to his devotees.
The Temple Car Festival is celebrated at the beginning of the birth of the star sign of Lord Perumal. The star sign of Perumal of the temple is Aastha. The signs Aastha and Rohini have similar facets. Therefore, at the beginning of the Star Sign Rohini the Car festival is commenced and its ends during the birth of the star sign Aastha. The festival is commenced with hoisting the Holy Flag on the first day followed by the Holy Car processions on subsequent days. Shimmavaganam, Anumandha Vaganam, Karuda Sevai, Thiru Kalyana Pushpa Vimana Utsav are the Holy Cars which are taken in a procession for four subsequent days after the Holy Flag Hoisting.
Tamil New Year, Sri Rama Navami & Sri Ramanuja Jayanthi during Chithirai Month, Nammalvar Thiru Natchatram, Narasimha Jayanthi and Pattar Thiru Natchatram during Vaikasi Month, Chakkarathalwar Thiru Natchatram during Aani Month, Thakshinaayanapunya Kaalam and Andal Thiruvaadipooram during Aadi Month, Senai Mudalvar Thiru Natchatram, Manavaala Mamunigal Thiru Natchatram and Deepavali during Aipasi Month, Thirumangai Alvar Thiru Natchatram and Thiru Karthigai Deepam during Karthigai Month, Pagal Pathu and Ra Pathu during Margazhi Month, Pongal and Kurathaalvar Thiru Natchatram during Thai Month and Ranga Naachiyaar Panguni Uthram in Panguni Month are the other festivals celebrated in this temple with much fanfare.

Shirdi Sai Baba Temple is a Hindu Temple dedicated to Indian Saint Sai Baba of Shirdi located in the Mylapore in Chennai City in Tamilnadu. The Sai Baba Temple located at Venkatesa Agraharam Street in Mylapore is also known as All India Sai Baba Samaj. The temple was built in commemoration of Saint Shirdi Sai Baba who became a proponent of Sufism and used to perform miracles. To the present day, the light lit by Sai Baba is still here. The Temple is one of the oldest temples dedicated to Sai Baba in South India.
It is the first Sai Baba Temple in the entire Chennai. Sri Narasimha Swamy was the founder member of this temple. The temple, also known as ‘Shirdi of the South’, it sees many devotees from all over the country paying a visit to the temple. The temple is administered by All India Sai Baba Samaj. The temple allows people from all walks of life irrespective of their religion. The large hall inside the temple is suitable for meditation as well.
Sri Shirdi Sai Baba Temple in Chennai was built to commemorate the memory of Shirdi Sai Baba who was born in Shirdi as a Hindu and was brought by a Muslim Fakir. He later became an exponent of Sufism. He too performed “Sithu” (Miracles) like his mentor. The temple was built in 1952 by Narasimhaswami, Sai Baba devotee from Salem, out of money donated by a Chettiar merchant. In the beginning, he worshipped a picture of Baba under a tamarind tree on the street where the temple is now located.
Later, he moved the picture to a small house in Nanjunda Rao Colony in Mylapore. Swamiji constructed the present temple with help from his friend J.D. Pannalal, and performed the first consecration. This is considered the most trusted temple in India. The temple is the headquarters of the All India Sai Samaj. Its main object being propagation of the life and teachings of Sri Sai Baba of Shirdi. Through two decades of tireless preaching, during which he travelled almost the entire Bharat, Sri Swamiji made the name of Sri Sai Baba as familiar as that of Siva, Rama and Krishna.
Sri Swamiji authored many books highlighting that Sri Sai Baba’s mission was to bring together two communities opposed to each other – the Hindus and Muslims – within a common fold, that Baba promoted a religion of love with peace and harmony, and that Baba belonged to no particular religion or faith, that he was neither Hindu nor Muslim, with his birth and early life shrouded in mystery.
On Thursdays, the temple is open from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m., and on other days it is open from 5 a.m. to noon and 5 p.m. to 9 p.m.
Many festivals are organised here, the most important one being the 10-day Navarathri celebration, which ends on Mahasamadhi day, which falls on Vijayadasami.

The temple is open from 6.30 am to 11. am in the mornings and 4.00 pm to 9.00 pm in the evenings.
This is a very active and vibrant temple with Urchavams all through the year like Thiru Aadi Pooram & Neerattu Uthsavam (10 days) for Andal; Utsavams commemorating the Thiru Nakshatrams of Azhwars and Acharyas; Sri Bhashayakarar Uthsavam (10 days) culminating in the Satrumurai on Chithirai Thiruvadirai; 10-day Uthsavam for Peyazhwar concluding on Aippasi Sathayam, the Azhwar’s Avathara day; Sri Rama Navami Uthsavam for 10 days etc., Hayagriva Aradhanai celebrated in a grand manner on the seventh day of Desikan Uthsavam is very special.
Although the age of the temple is not clear the Idols of Vedanta Desikar and Lakshmi Hayagriva has been in existence here for more than 350 years. Idols of Lord Srinivasa and Goddess Alarmelmangai were installed much later in 1924. The temple, however, continues to be known by the name of the acharya. The temple has been notified as one of historic importance by the Government of India in the year 1973.
Vedanta Desikar, Incarnation of the Thirupathi Divine Bell: 
Vedanta Desikar, one of the most important Acharyas of the Vaishnava tradition was born to the devout couple Ananthasuri and Thotharamba. Instructed by the Venkatamudayan, the couple went on a pilgrimage to Thirumalai. The Lord appeared in the couple’s dream as a Vaishnava youth and handed over a golden bell which Thotharamba swallowed. The following morning, they were astonished to find that both of them had dreamt the same sequence of events.
When the Archaka opened the doors of the Sanctum Sanctorum, he found the bell missing. During an investigation ordered into the loss of the bell, the Lord appeared by Avesa (spiritual trance) on Tirumalai Nambi and told that he had himself presented the bell to the Ananthasuri couple and thereafter, the small hand-bell need not be used in the Tiruvaradhana in the temple. Hence, Swami Vedanta Desikar is considered as the incarnation of the Divine Bell.
Vedanta Desikar as prime deity here:
Azhwars and Acharyas travelled throughout the country extolling the beauty and grace of Narayana. However, in the case of Mylapore, the Supreme Lord and the Acharyan switched roles. Lord Srinivasa and Alarmel Mangai Thayar willed to grace the abode of the Acharyan (Swami Desikan) and relish his company.

https://www.bharattemples.com/thiruvalluvar-temple-mylapore-chennai/,"Thiruvalluvar Temple, Mylapore, Chennai
This is a memorial believed to have been constructed in the early 16th century, the temple was extensively renovated in the 1970s. As a book on Mylapore temples published in 1929 refers this temple as Thiruvalluvar temple, we could safely assume that this temple is older than 1929 CE. But people considered Thiruvalluvar as God and performed poojas and changed the memorial in to a temple. Hence, it is called Thiruvalluvar Temple. In his book called Thirumayilayin Thirukoilgal, published in 1989, Dr. S. Rajendran believes that the temple was built in the early part of the 16th Century. This is not evident, as the temple was extensively renovated in the early 1970s and most of the stone structures were replaced by concrete.
This Temple is a simple, two-roomed shrine enclosed by an open-pillared portico. The east facing sanctum enshrines big idol for Thiruvalluvar. The stone idol appears to be old. It’s interesting to find the stucco idols of Valluvar on his own vimana. The bronze idols of Valluvar and his wife Vasuki are also located in the sanctum. As part of the grand Mylapore annual festival (of the famous Kapaleeshwarar temple), on the 8th day of the festival, the bronze idol of Valluvar is also taken into procession along with 63 Nayanmars.
Vasuki is found in a separate east facing shrine, which is found on the left side of the sanctum. A holy tree with a lot of snake stones and a stucco image of Mari Amman is found. There is a larger than life marble statue of Thiruvalluvar in sitting posture and of his parents Sri Adi and Sri Bhagavan, with Sri Adi holding him as a child in her arms and kneeling before her husband. A cylinder with an inscription (dated 1935 CE) that reads that it was the base of the Iluppai tree where the poet was born, is found on the pedestal.
This Tree is located just by the side of the Maha Mandapam or the Meditation Hall This Iluppai Tree is more than 2000 years old Iluppai tree under which Thiruvalluvar is said to have born got damaged in 1935 and the base of the tree is being protected with a cover. There is a separate shrine for Ekambareswarar Shiva Linga. The sub-shrine of Kamakshi is located near this shrine. The koshta images of Dakshina Murti, Lingodhbava, Brahma and Durga are found on the wall of the shrine.
The niche images of Ganesh and Subramanya-Valli-Devasena are found at the entrance. The stucco image depicting Valluvar worshiping Shiva and Parvati on the lintel is interesting. Valluvar is treated on par with the other Saivite saints. The small sub-shrines of Hanuman, Ganesh, Chandikeswara, Bhairava, Saneeswara and Navagraha are also found in this temple. The Ekambareswarar shrine is considered as the birth place of Thiruvalluvar by some researchers and as the Samadhi by others. This temple is completely dedicated to his contribution to Tamil literature. Classes on the Thirukural are also held in the evenings for children.
To the rear, near a neem tree surrounded by naga statues, was a shrine for Amman. All these suggest that the temple was originally a village temple that slowly gained prominence as a Shiva temple and then became the shrine for Thiruval­luvar. Except for the stone idols, there are no traces of the structure of the original temple after the renovation by the Government. The processional deity of Ekambareswarar is stored in a temple vault and the ones of Thiruvalluvar and Vasuki are clearly a century or two old.
There is a famous incident in Thiruvalluvar-Vasuki life in which, while Vasuki was fetching water in a pot from a well, Thiruvalluvar called her and she went leaving the pot as it was but incidentally the pot remained half way as it was. This historical well can be seen here, but there is no water now and is closed with sand. It is also covered with a steel grill for safety reasons.
When death separated his wife, Vasuki Ammaiyar from Thiruvalluvar, the saint, laments like all other commoners, unable to bear the grief of her separation. The poet, noted for his unique style of the couplets in Tamil, changes to quatrain, which he did only once, and dedicates this verse, to his bereaved wife.
 
The Temple is situated at about 700 meters East of the statue of Thiruvalluvar on the Royapettah High road near Luz Anjaneyar Temple. The access to this temple is through narrow roads after crossing the Buckingham canal bridge towards Nattu Subburaya Mudali Street. Then the road branches off to North, leading to an arch way into the temple. This Temple is also located very near Mundaga Kanni Amman Temple.

According to Hindu mythology, Veerabhadra is a God, who was born out of Lord Shiva’s wrath to destroy Daksha. In all ancient South Indian Shiva temples, you can find the idol of Veerabhadra. However, it is very rare to find the temples with Veerabhadra as the presiding deity. There is one such rare temple dedicated to Veerabhadra in Mylapore area of Chennai in South India.
The north facing temple does not have a tower but just an arch at the entrance. The north facing sanctum enshrines the big idol of the presiding deity, Veerabhadra who is found along with the small image of goat headed Daksha. In Maha Mandapam, the shorter flag staff, bali peetha and Nandi are found facing towards the sanctum. Small shrines of Bala Vinayaka and Subramanya are located on either side of the main shrine. The Goddess of the temple is Abhayambikai who is found in a separate shrine adjacent to the sanctum.
There are so many small sub-shrines located on either side of the sanctum. Some of the other shrines that are found near the sanctum include Virupaksha-Vishalakshi, Sivasundara Vinayaka, Sarabeswarar, Murugan-Valli-Devasena, Perumal and Adi Shankaracharya. At the entrance of the Maha Mandapam, the idols of Bala Vinayaka and Bala Murugan are located. The prakara around the sanctum has few shrines such as Dyana Anjaneya, Saneeswara, Navagraha, Vishnu Durga, Shiva Durga, Chandikeswara and Dhakshinamoorthi.

Sasti Sura Samharam, Aadi Kirthikai, Vaikasi Visakam and Thai Poosam are the festivals celebrated in this temple with much fanfare. Kerala Tantram is the protocol of worship offered here as with most other temples in Kanyakumari district. As with Vellimalai, the last Friday in every Tamil month is considered to be auspicious and Kanji is offered as prasadam here.
It is believed that not only the devotees who come here for prayer are benefited, but also the people who visit the hill. It is because that the Lord of this hill blesses one and all without any discrimination. Those who make any request at this holy place would get relief from their impediments and attain happiness. The sick people may find much relief if they stay for some days here. Mental depression and worries can be reduced by the holy visit of this hill temple. The poor may find guidance to get relief from their poverty. The depressed may find peace and solace. Austeries and Vratha (restriction afford) taken for six days of Skanda Sasti period with deep prayers are equated with many years of penance and Yoga practices.
The Karthika Vratham, and the visit on that day for the Dharshan of the deity will bring more benediction than the one gets taking baths in several sacred rivers. The devotees get relaxation and mental peace when they sit before the deity and pray earnestly. Annadhanam and other charities bring prosperity in one’s life.  This place attracts the great and noble persons with spiritual turn of mind. Local belief has it that barren women go on to deliver healthy children upon worshipping at this temple.
 
Temple Construction:
Nearly 1200 years back the village Vellimalai was covered with thick forest. At that time, there lived a saintly person on the hill. He had the divine power of healing chronic diseases. So, the surrounding people visited this noble soul for getting his blessings and got their diseases cured. He was known as a great ‘Siddhar’. He lived in a cave which was at the foot of the present steps on the eastern side of the shrine. One day, a small crowd of the people came to see the Siddhar. He came out of the fire cave and reached the top of the hill where the sanctity of Sanatorium of the present Muruga Temple is situated. He then miraculously disappeared.
From that incidence, the people believed that the holy person was none other than the God himself. From that time onwards, people came there on every Friday to worship the God by lighting lamps there and a small temple was built. In due course, it developed as a pilgrimage centre of Lord Muruga. A small temple was built by erecting a thatched shed on the hill top.
The devotees felt the need of improving the thatched shed temple. With their service of enthusiasm, they erected a tile structure for the temple. People of all communities namely Nadars, Brahmins, Washermen, Parayas, came on every Friday and worshipped the idol of Muruga.
Till 1937, the people worshipped the God in the tiled building. After that, the devotees revealed their intention of building a full structured temple in this place. At that time, there was no facility for the devotees either to take rest or to eat food. There was hardly a place to sit for some time. There was no road or path to reach the temple. A strong plan was developed then in the minds of the surrounding villagers to improve this place. The credit of the development of the Vellimalai Temple goes to Mr. A. Palaniyandi Pillai of Thalakulam who was a staunch Muruga devotee.
With his earnest effort, he collected Rs. 100/- as contribution from the people of the surrounding places and handed over the amount to Mr. Unnithon, Chairman of Kochi Devasom Board, as caution money and requested him to erect a new temple by replacing the tiled building. Mr. Swaminathan Pillai became the Chairman of the Temple Endowment Committee and Mr. Brammananda Swamy Nadar became its Secretary. With the help and interest of these members who hailed from South Travancore, a new mandapam was built for the temple.
As a matter of fact, there was no road or path-ways then to reach this temple. With the efforts of the local people and by the grace of Lord Muruga, two roads were laid, one through Kalpadi and another from Manavilai to reach the base of the hill. There was a great hurdle to construct the eastern side road. The lands spread on the eastern side of the hill belonged to Dr. Chellakkan from Nagercoil. The eastern road from Manavilai was laid up to the boundary of Dr. Chellakkan.
Mr. Palani Appan, son of Arumughan, who was a staunch believer of Muruga led a delegation to Nagercoil, met the doctor and explained to him that a road had already been constructed up to his plot. They requested him to part with some area of his plot so that the already constructed road could be extended up to the Sannidhanam of the temple. He did not accept their request. Again Mr. Gnayam Pillai Nadar, a pious teacher from Manavilai, personally requested Dr. Chellakkan to donate a piece of his land stating the social, cultural and religious need of the public.
Though he was a rich man having several acres of land there, he flatly denied their request and the delegation and the teacher returned with broken hearts. On the same night, the doctor had a miraculous dream in which Lord Muruga appeared before him and instructed to donate the land for the extension of the road to reach the temple. He summoned the members next day and narrated them the dream that he had seen the previous day. He came forward to give his land for the road purpose. Thus, the first road was formed to reach the Temple of Muruga at Vellimalai.
Birthplace of Valli:
It is popularly believed that Valli was born here, and raised by a tribal king and she got married to Lord Murugan in a Love marriage. Nonetheless, similar story is associated with another namesake place, Vallimalai in Vellore district and Thiruthani of Tiruvallur district in the far north of Tamil Nadu.

https://www.bharattemples.com/raghaveswarar-temple-derisanamcope-kanyakumari/,"Raghaveswarar Temple, Derisanamcope, Kanyakumari
It has its history related to Ramayana (The Epic of India). When Lord Ram had killed Thadagai (Demoness), he worshiped Lord Shiva at this place in order to get relief from the sin of killing a woman. Thus, the Lord Shiva here was consecrated by Lord Ram before he had worshipped at the more famous Rameswaram. So, this place is also called Adi Rameswaram and the Lord is known as Raghaveswarar.
Derisanamcope is so called because Lord Ram had shot three arrows at the Thadaka which together had stitched up her body. Thus, Trisharam (Three arrows) Korpu (stich) has become today’s Derisanamcope.
It is believed that Rajaraja Chola build this temple with the same structure of Thanjavur Brihadeeswarar Temple.
Presiding Deity is called as Raghaveswarar and Mother is called as Ulaga Nayaki Ammai. Lord Shiva and the Mother shrines are seen facing the east. In between the two is the shrine of Lord Subramanyar along with his consorts Valli and Deivayanai. Hence, the place is also referred to as Somaskanda Sthalam. The roof above the Lord is in the shape of Meru. The main shrine is at a height above the prakaram due to which devotees have to climb up a few stairs to reach it.
Ulaga Nayaki Ammai is seen holding the flower Neelotpalam in her right hand. It is believed that this idol, about 5 feet high, was obtained in the Ganga river and brought here. Locals believe that by worshipping the Goddess here the devotees derive the benefit of worshipping the Goddess Ulaga Nayaki at Papanasam. On the right side of the shrine, stairs leading into a tunnel underground is visible. It is believed that this was created to hide temple properties etc. during times of enemy attacks.
Shrine of Lord Vinayakar is in front of Lord Shiva. On the left side of the Lord Shiva, bronze idols of Aadalvallan, Sivagami, Chandrasekhara Murti, Karaikkal Ammaiyar, Rama, Lakshmana and Hanuman are seen. In a corner of the inner prakaram, Lord Dakshina Murti is seen. Shrine of Lord Chandeswara is also seen. The Holy tree of the temple is Vilvam. The shrine of Swarna Akarshana Bhairavar faces east. Worshipping here is believed to bestow prosperity and wealth on the devotees.
A sculpture of Lord Ram killing Thadaka is seen inside the Mahamandapam on the west Prakaram. Inscriptions are seen in some stones which were written during the eighth and tenth years of the reign of the King Rajaraja Chola. In these inscriptions, the Lord is referred to as Cheeraghavan Iswaramudai Nayanar. In a pillar, the figure of Adi Shankaracharya is inscribed from which it is inferred that the saint had visited this temple.
As at Rameswaram, there are two Theerthams (ponds) are located in the front and back of the temple. The pond in the front is called Theerthavari Kulam and the pond at the back is called Godavari Theertham. A small rivulet case Nanjil Nattu Gangai flows in front of the temple. Outside the temple, on the way to the rivulet, there is the Vadakku Vazh Selvi temple. The Goddess, Munnootru Nangai is worshipped as the guardian deity of this village.
The Temple is located at about 3 Kms from Azhagiapandipuram, 4 Kms from Boothapandi, 2 Kms from Thittu Vilai, 15 Kms from Aralvaimozhi, 8 Kms from Thazhakudy, 15 Kms from Nagercoil, 16 Kms from Thovalai, 20 Kms from Suchindram, 34 Kms from Kanyakumari and 80 Kms from Thiruvananthapuram.

Pakshirajapuram:
According to a legend, a sculptor who was an ardent devotee of the Lord etched an image of Garuda in wood while in Kanchipuram and as the bird was made according to Shilpa Shastras, it came to life and flew Southwards. After arriving at the Parakkai village, Garuda, it is said, had a dip in the tank in front of the temple and exclaimed “kandaen kulam”, with joy. Immediately after, he hovered around the deity as though he was making a Pradikshina and began to fly away.
An artisan, who was renovating a pillar at the temple, saw the bird and hurled a chisel at it. The bird fell down crying `Madhusudhana’, much to the shock and disbelief of the man. As a result, its right wing suffered a wound. A stone image was later carved at the spot where he fell. The village came to be known as Pakshirajapuram as per this legend.
Other Names:

The Sthala Puranam (history of the temple) is very interesting. While fighting the demon Ravana to take back the abducted Sita, Lakshmana, brother of Rama is injured in the battle hurt by a missile from Ravana’s son. Jambavan, the bear Advisor, says that he can be rescued by an herb called Sanjeevini. Hanuman is sent back to India to bring the herb. Hanuman sets out to the Himalayas, finds the hill where the herb grows but cannot recognize it. He uproots the entire mountains and returns.
Meanwhile, Sukracharya, Ravana’s Guru and the preceptor for all Rakshasas (demons) says that he needs to be stopped from returning. Ravana, sends Saturn one of the nine enslaved planets who form the nine steps to his throne to stop Hanuman. Sani (Saturn) accosts Hanuman. Hanuman asks Sani the reason for stopping him from returning. Sani says that he is now under the rule of Ravana and has come to stop Hanuman from proceeding to Sri Lanka. Hanuman places the entire mountain on Sani who is unable to bear the weight. Sani surrenders.
Hanuman then lifts the mountain and crushes Sani under his foot. Sani requests for forgiveness. Hanuman does so under the conditions that Sani is not to impede anyone’s path who chants Rama’s name. Hanuman then returns to Sri Lanka with herb and rest of the story is known. The temple idol of Hanuman here is in the posture of crushing Sani Bhagwan under his foot. This is the history that is told about this temple and a huge sanctum of Hanuman, about 11 feet height with Shani being stamped under his leg.

4) Sethu Madhava at Rameshwaram in Tamilnadu.
5) Sundara Madhava at Thiruanantapuram or Trivandrum in Kerala
The mythological story related to this Pancha Madhava Kshetras goes like this. Twashta was one of the Prajapatis created by Lord Brahma. He had one son named Vishwarupa. Vishwarupa was very noble. He once started doing great tapas. Indra became afraid that Vishwarupa might take his kingdom so resorted to all kind of tricks to destroy and disturb his tapasya but all in vain. Then Indra chopped Vishwarupa’s head with his Vajrayudha. Indra also lured Taksha to help him in chopping heads of Vishwarupa. Vishwarupa is said to have three heads.
On hearing the sad end of his beloved son Twashta got enraged and started Homa to create a massive Asura from his krodhagni. Twashta named him viratasura and ordered him to defeat Indra to avenge the death of his elder brother. Viratasura defeated Indra. Later, the treacherous Indra befriended him and killed him. Thus, Indra acquired the sin of Brahmahatti, which is considered to be worst kind of sin. To absolve himself of this great sin Indra consecrated these Pancha Madhava Temples. So, it is believed that a pilgrimage to these Pancha Madhava Kshetras has a power to absolve one off all one’s sins.

Margazhi Thiruvizha in the months of Dec and Jan and 11 days Vaikasi Visakam Utsavam are the festivals celebrated here.
Worshipping Lord Vinayaga of this Sthala helps cure aliments related to stomach. Those who have huge debts, worship goddess Ananthavalli for six weeks by lighting a deepam with lemon shell, will get their debts cleared. Since Sage Agastya got to witness the wedding of Lord Shiva, worshipping the deities of the temple removes obstacles to marriages. This is a parihara Sthalam for delay in marriage.
Lord Brihaspathi (Guru) present in the outer sannidhi, when worshipped every Thursday by lighting a ghee deepam, facilitates timely marriage, when there are marriage obstacles. It is a general practice in villages that the panchayat decisions or people’s issues will be addressed amidst large village gathering. Before such important decisions/verdicts are to be made, people promise in front of lord Poi Solla Pillaiyar and then decide.
Inscriptions found in Koovam and Thakkolam temples talk about the glory of this temple. Manavur, dates back to the 7th century AD when the Kurumbas ruled the ancient Thondai Mandalam. They divided it into 24 divisions of which Manavur happened to be the 4th division. True to its legacy, this small village boasts of several inscriptions and sculptures found in the sanctum sanctorum of the 1200-year old Thirunandeeswarar, Kandaswamy and Vinayagar temples. Of the three, the villagers have embarked on a mission to renovate the Thirunandeeswarar temple, which is in a dilapidated state.
Thirunandheeswarar & Nandhi Theertham:
Nandhi Bhagavan, initiated a sacred water source, which is now serving as the temple tank, took holy dip in the beautiful temple pond, worshipped lord Shiva and got his curse relieved. Hence the temple tank has the name Nandi Theertham and the Lord is called Thirunandeeswarar. It is also believed that Ganga Devi who captivated in Lord Shiva’s Head, is the source of water flow to this temple tank.
Manavur:
Lord Shiva after his celestial dance performance in Thiruvalangadu, which Karaikal Ammaiyar witnessed, came to Manavur and gave darshan to sage Agasthiar with his consort Ananthavalli. There is a famous saying “ஆடியது ஆலங்காட்டில், அமர்ந்தது திருவூறலில், மணந்தது மணவூரில்”. Which means, Lord Shiva danced in Thiruvalangadu, rested in Thiruvooral (now known as Thakkolam) and married Parvathi at Manavur. Hence the village got the name Manavur.
Temple Door:
It is also being said that when this temple was well maintained, the doors of this temple, when closed, the bell sound will be heard in Chidambaram, only after which the Chidambaram temple will be closed. Also, during mogul invasion, the villagers, in a measure to save such beautiful doors, seem to have hid these doors, by throwing it in the village pond.
Construction of Rajagopuram:
There was story for the construction of Rajagopuram. When they tried to construct the Rajagopuram and do the Kumbabishekam, faced lot of problems and work was moving in a snail space. After prasannam they came to know that the delay was due to neglect of Ganapathy temple in front of Rajagopuram. After Kumbabishekam was performed to Rajaganapathy, they could able to construct the Rajagopuram without any hurdle.

Sage Rishya Shringa, (also called as Kalaikottu Muni by Kambar in his Kamba Ramayana) the son of Sage Vibhandaka and Urvashi (There is another version which says that he was born out of a deer which had swallowed the semen of the sage released in water and hence had the face of a deer with horns) had mystical and magical powers. The place where he lived was blessed with abundant rainfall and fertility. Sage Vashista advised King Dasaratha to perform the Putra Kameshti Yagna, through Sage Rishya Shringa in order to be blessed with sons.
On hearing this, the women of the assembly vowed to go and bring the Sage to Ayodhya. They met him at his hermitage and offered fruits and flowers and won his good will. After a few days, they invited him to go with them. As the sage moved from the hermitage, the rain God followed him, showering good rains and pleasant weather as he went along. King Romapada, of Anga, whose kingdom was suffering from drought and famine, met the Rishi as he passed through his province, and invited him to stay there.
He offered his daughter Shanta, (originally born to King Dasaratha and Kausalya and adopted by King Romapada, and his wife Vershini, who was the elder sister of Kausalya) hand in marriage to the Saint. The saint accepted the invitation and stayed at Anga Desa (today’s Bihar and Jharkhand). On hearing this, King Dasaratha went and met King Romapada and requested his help to bring Sage Rishya Shringa to Ayodhya. The King agreed to help and with his humble request, Sage Rishya Shringa proceeded to Ayodhya with his wife Shanta and performed the Putra Kameshti Yagna for twelve months.
At the end of Yagna, a demon appeared with the Pinda which was shared between the three queens of Dasaratha, Kausalya, Kaikeyi and Sumithra, resulting in the birth of Rama, Bharata, Lakshmana and Shatrugna. Sage Rishya Shringa has installed Shiva Lingas in different parts of the country for rains and fertility. This is one such temple situated on the banks of the Cooum at Thiruvur. Since Lord Shiva was installed by Rishya Shringa, Lord Shiva is called as Sringandeeswarar.

https://www.bharattemples.com/aadhi-mariamman-temple-inam-samayapuram-trichy/,"Aadhi Mariamman Temple, Inam Samayapuram, Trichy
According to a legend, the current deity was initially at the famous Ranganatha Swamy temple in Srirangam. When one of that temple’s chief priests believed that the idol caused illness in him, he is said to have ordered for its removal from the temple. There was a common belief of the people from that in region that such local Gods possess immense powers and so must always be appeased by making appropriate offerings and sacrifices. Thus, the idol was moved out of the Srirangam town, and was later identified by some of the by passers, who is said to have built a temple for this deity called the Kannanur Mariamman temple. Sometime around the 17th century CE, the region surrounding Trichy is said to have been ruled by the Vijayanagar kings who used the area primarily as an army base. It is believed that the Vijayanagara ruler vowed to build a temple for his goddess if they get to win the war. And accordingly, they built this temple on tasting success.
The actual history behind the temple’s origin remains unclear. The present temple structures were constructed during the early 18th century by King Vijayaraya Chakravarthy. The Goddess is believed to have been worshipped by locals even before the construction of this temple, but those details remain unauthenticated.
The temple remains open from 6.00 a.m. to 11.00 a.m. and 4.00 p.m. and 8.30 p.m.
The following are the list of poojas offered at the temple;
Poochoridal (showering of flowers) in the month of Thai (January-February), Masi Thiruvizha in February-March, Vijayadasami in September-October are the festivals very devotionally celebrated in the temple. As a recalling of an earlier festival of S. Kannanore Mariamman invited to Kollidam-Cauvery River, a ritual of inviting Samayapuram Adhi Mariamman here on the first Sunday of Chithirai month (April-May) is being followed now also where the deity stays for a night and return back.
Those awaiting marriages worship Nagakanni and tie the yellow thread submitted to the deity on the Neem tree here. The worship expedites marriage processes. Those seeking child boon tie a small wooden cradle on the tree. Devotees worship the Goddess on New Moon and Full Moon days and stay in the temple to get their ambitions realized. Devotees perform abishek to the Goddess on realizing their boons. Goddess Samayapurathal is believed to grant all the wishes of her devotees. After offering prayers to the goddess, many devotees volunteer to stay and serve the temple, as a thanks giving to the deity for curing them from small pox. People who are disabled and vision impaired, pray the divine Mother for getting relieved from their disabilities. People also offer prayers to the deity seeking good agricultural yields and business development.
Devotees undertake to Tonsure their heads and offer Archanas and Abishek as a way of showing gratitude to the deity. Ear boring ritual is also done here. Devotees also perform the ritual of pulling the golden chariot, carrying fire pots, performing the angapradakshina (rolling over the temple precinct), etc. They also worship the goddess offering sugarcane cradles, alighting lamps made from flour and ghee during Thaipoosam, donating paddy, grains, sheep, cocks as their prayer commitment. They also arrange for ritual of Annadhaana which involves feeding the poor. Mavilakku is a sweet dish which is made from mixing jaggery, rice flour and ghee. This Mavilakku is offered to the goddess as an important offering. Raw salt is also offered to the deity by the natives.

The temple is one of the oldest structures in Chennai. It was originally built by the Pallavas in the 8th century by king Narasimha Varman I. The temple has icons of five forms of Vishnu: Narasimha, Rama, Gajendra Varadaraja, Ranganatha and Krishna. The temple subscribes to Vaikhanasa agama and follows Thenkalai tradition. There are separate entrances for the Krishna and Narasimha temples. The gopuram (towers) and mandapas (pillars) are decorated with elaborate carvings, a standard feature of South Indian Temple Architecture. Swami Vivekananda, Maths genius Ramanujam, politician Sathyamurthy had worshipped Lord Parthasarathy.
The Parthasarathy Swamy temple in Tiruvallikeni is the only Divya Desam among the 108 strictly within Chennai city limits. The other two Divya Desams close to Chennai are the Nithyakalyana Perumal temple in Thiruvidandai and the Ranganatha Swami temple in Thiruneermalai (both in Kanchipuram District). Steeped in mythologies and eulogized by the Azhwars in their sacred hymns in Tamil glorified as Divya Prabhandham the Parthasarathy temple at Tiruvallikeni or Triplicane, as the Britishers called it, happens to be the oldest temple in the city.
The existence of the Tiruvallikeni village is seen in records dating back to the Pallava period and earlier. One of the distinguishing features of Parthasarathy Temple is that it has representations of four incarnations or avatars of Vishnu: Narasimha, Rama, Varaha and Krishna. It also has letters written to the deity by Swami Vivekananda from the USA as he wanted to share his achievements with someone about spreading the message of Hinduism in the World Parliament of Religions that was held in Chicago on September 11, 1893. He chose Parthasarathy.
The temple remains open from 6.00 a.m. to 12.00 a.m. and from 4.00 p.m. and 9.00 p.m.
Lord Vishnu darshan to King Sumathi Rajan:
Vishnu devotee, king Sumathirajan by name had a desire to have the darshan of Lord as the Sarathy of Arjuna in the Kurukshetra battle field. He prayed to God for the darshan which Lord obliged as controlling and managing the Rath of Partha-Arjuna. The king begged the Lord to stay in the place in the same form.  Perumal appears only with his conch and not the discus. Lord absorbed the arrows shot by Bhishma aimed at Arjuna and thus sustained injuries. The scars are visible even now. Parthasarathy is the procession deity. As he grew prominent among the devotees, the temple came to be known as Parthasarathy temple.
Parthasarathy:
As per Mahabharata, Vishnu, in his avatar as Krishna was acting as charioteer for Arjuna, the Pandava prince during the war with Kauravas. Krishna did not take any weapons during the war. During the fight between Arjuna and Bhishma, Krishna was injured by the arrow from Bhishma. The mark in the image in the temple is believed to follow the legend.  These scars are visible in Lord’s face even now. Based on this history, Perumal is praised as Parthasarathy – driver of Partha-Arjuna. The Ghee component in the Nivedhana is more to cure these wounds, it is said. No spices are used in the Nivedhanas to Lord.  Praying to Lord Parthasarathy, people of unattractive complexion will understand the truth that beauty is not a constant one but may or will vanish one day due to age, illness or any other incidents in life.
Mother Vedavalli married Lord Ranganatha here:
In days of yore, Sage Brugu performed penance here to have Lord as his son-in-law. He found a female child in the Alli flower in the Pushkarini here.

The Lord obliged appearing with Sita Devi and his brothers Bharata, Shatrugna and Lakshmana. Unlike the Ranganatha in Srirangam, the Ranganatha in Tiruvallikeni does not face south, but east. But Rama here faces south probably to reassure Vibhishana that he is watching over him.
Saptharoma Maharishi got darshan of Gajendra Varadhar here:
Gajendra Varadhar is said to have been worshipped by Saptharoma Maharishi in accordance with the Vaikhanasa Agamam. The Moolavar is worshipped as Sri Gajendra Varadaraja Swamy as he has given Moksha to Gajendra after saving him from the jaws of a crocodile. The Lord in heaven heard the appealing tone of his Bhakta Gajendra who was dragged into the waters by the crocodile and he rushed to the spot seating on Garuda, the king of birds, holding discuss in one hand and conch in another to save his Bhakta and threw the discus at the crocodile and saved him from death.
Scars in Lord’s face:
In olden days, though the idol of the Lord was cast three times, the face of the Lord continues to have pimples. As the sculptor was worried about it, Venkatakrishnar appeared in his dream and convinced him that he (Krishna) has received injuries on the face by the arrows shot at him, at the Mahabharata war, he appeared so to remind them. The idol of Lord Parthasarathy is fine with all the other parts smooth except the face with its marks. Not only that; the toe next to the big toe in the left leg is without nail. The arrow shot by Bhishma to mark his surrender hit the nail of Krishna. At the hip of Parthasarathy there is a scar, it is said, which was formed as Yasodha tied a rope around the hip.
Sage Atreya installed Lord Vishnu here:
Sage Atreya requested Vedavyasa to mention to him a place fit for tapas. Vedavyasa directed Sage Atreya to go to Brindaranya, on the banks of the Kairavani Theertham, where King Sumathi was doing tapas.

The seven-day event attracts many devotees and onlookers from different parts of Chennai and Tamil Nadu. A floating structure made up of drums, timber would be constructed and would be beautifully decorated with lights, flowers, religious paintings, silken buntings, etc. which serves as a visual delight. For better ambience, lights were also installed in the garden around the tank and additionally, focus lights were placed on the corners of the Neerazhi Mandapam (the mandapam (structure) in the center of the temple tank).
Perumal (God) would come to the temple tank in Purapadu (departure) and be placed majestically inside the float. On all the days, the float completed five rounds around the Neerazhi Mandapam. After this, the deities were taken in a procession around the four Mada Streets. Devotees in hundreds would converge and sit on the steps of the temple tank to have darshan of the Lord on Theppam. The specialty of the third day function is the ‘Thirumanjanam’, performed to the deity inside the float. Other than the bhattachariars (temple priests), no one is allowed inside the float. A Rescue team of about 10 swimmers is usually provided by the Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services.

Velleeswarar Temple is a Hindu Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva located at Mylapore in Chennai City in Tamilnadu. The presiding deity is Shiva in the form of Velleeswarar. Mother is called as Kamakshi. The temple is located at the South Mada street and is very close to the famous landmark of Chennai – Kapaleeshwarar Temple. This Temple is managed by the HR&CE Dept. of the Government of Tamil Nadu.
The temple remains open from 06.00 AM to 11.00 AM and 05.00 PM to 08.30 PM.
The prominent festival of this temple conducted on the 8th day of the Tamil month Vaikasi (between May 15th to June 15th), is the Brahmotsavam, during which the restoration of eyesight of Sukracharya would be enacted. The idols of Trimurtis (Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu as Vamana) along with idols of King Mahabali and Sukracharya would be brought as procession. In a place near the temple, a stage would be set where Guru Sukracharya would be meditating. An Oduvar (person, nominated by the temple for singing Gods songs), recites the Thirumurai verses related to the restoration of eyesight of Sukracharya. Deeparadhana is performed indicating the conclusion of the event.
The temple must have been built over 300 years. One of the carvings at the temple shows the people in charge of the temple between 1875 – 1995.  It is believed that initially only the Ganesha statue was installed and later all the other primary deities moved in. This appears to be true as the foremost deity as soon as we enter the temple is Selva Vinayakar, i.e Ganesha along with his wives Siddhi and Buddhi. It is also claimed that this temple is as old as Kapaleeshwarar temple. There is no record on the builder or the construction year.

Tirunandeeswaram:
A bull in the region was threatening the residents. All prayed to Lord Shiva to contain its violence and the Lord obliged. While pulling, the bull fell in a pit and could not come out. It became the Nandhi of the temple. The installation is designed as if it is in the pit. As the Lord Himself installed it, the place is called Tirunandeeswaram. The symbols of the bull foot and the rope are still visible in the temple.
Nandhi growing in Size:
There is a statue of Nandi which is placed in front Lord Siva. Local fables describe that the bull came from the rock near the temple and took place in front of the Lord. They believe that the bull is growing as the years pass.
Sage Vyakarapadhar worshipped Lord Shiva here:
Sage Vyakarapadhar visited this place and worshipped Lord Shiva here.
Sage Parasurama got relieved of his sin of killing his mother here:
Sage Parasurama sought relief from the sin of killing his own mother by worshipping Lord Nandeeswarar.
The temple is believed to have been built by King Rajaraja Chola. The place is called Thirunanthikarai in honour of an ascetic named Veeranandi, who carved the rock cut cave temple.
The significance of the temple lies in its Nakshatra Mandapam (hall of stars). There are 27 holes called Ganadwaras representing the 27 star regions. Though the temple is the abode of the Lord Shiva, a shrine of Lord Vishnu is also present in the temple facing Lord Shiva. There are shrines for Ganapathy, Vishnu, Sastha and Nagar in the corridor (prakara) of the temple. The temple is built based on Kerala architectural style.
The Vimanam(roof) of the sanctum is conical and tiled. There is pond near by the temple and a garden with varieties of vegetation. There is an ancient rock-cut cave temple situated towards the northern side of this temple. The ancient rock cut cave temple belonging to Jains, where later a Shivalingam was installed is next to this shrine. This temple has inscriptions of the king Varaguna Pandiya (9th century ACE) and Rajaraja Chozhan (11th century ACE).
The temple remains open from 6.00 a.m. to 11.00 a.m. and 4.00 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.
Tiruvadhirai in Margazhi (December-January) and Mahasivarathri in Masi (February-March) are the important festivals celebrated in the temple besides special pujas on Mondays (Somavaram) and Pradosha days. The temple is a part of the famed Shivalaya Ottam conducted during Mahasivarathri. On the Mahasivarathri day, devotees run from one Shiva temple to the other. The distance between the temples is 100 km. Even today, this practice is followed by the people in Thirunanthikarai.
As the Nandhi in the temple had been installed by Lord Shiva Himself, it is said that this is choice temple for worship on Pradosha days (the 13th day either from New Moon or full moon days). This is an ideal temple for those seeking to mend their wicked mind with sins of serious crimes as murder committed knowingly or unknowingly. Devotees pay their gratitude to the Lord and Mother by performing abishek and offering vastras – clothes. Generally, devotees go around the Prakaras thrice in the temples. But it is said that even a single round blesses the devotee in this temple with the huge benefit of doing so throughout the year.

The king, who ruled Keralapuram, went for a pilgrimage to Rameshwaram, a famous Shaivite temple facing Bay of Bengal. A Ganesh idol is washed over while the king and his men were washing their legs at the Rameshwaram beach. The king then gifts it to his Rameshwaram counterpart ‘’Sethu Mannan’’. Sethu Mannan was overwhelmed by the love and affection, however he returns the gift back to the Keralapuram King. It was his opinion and belief that the finder should have it and it was the right thing to do. Along with the idol, the Rameshwaram King gifts another Huge Emerald Idol. However, the Mogul later looted the emerald idol during their invasion. They could not take the idol with them, it was stuck to the ground. So, the idol was left behind.
There are two temples inside the temple complex one for lord Shiva and another is for lord Ganesha. Lord Shiva here is known as Mahadevar. It is believed that the temple was built in 1317. The idols were established long before the temple was built. Although, it is primarily a Shiva temple, one can clearly see the Vaishnava’s influence in this temple. Those days Vaishnava’s dominance was high and it reflects through Vaishnava signs throughout the temple.
This temple was renovated many times over the centuries and this information is available in the temples scriptures. There are beautiful paintings drawn on the walls inside the temple. There was a huge tree under it is a snake carved out of granite stone. Adhisaya Vinayakar Temple has a long passage and walls are adorned with magnificent paintings. The sacred sanctum has an iron grid sliding door. The sacred sanctum is not an enclosed chamber, as the lord is placed outside, and under the huge banyan tree.
The idol here changes its color every six months. Lord Vinayakar’s idol changes its color to black and white once in every six months. During Utharayana (March-June), the idol is black, and in Dakshiyana (July-Feb) idol turns to white. Because of this Vinayaga Idol, this temple came to be known as Adhisaya Vinayagar Temple (Miracle Ganesh Temple). Many devotees will visit here just see the color change.
There is a well inside the temple complex and the color of the water too changes every six months. When the idol is white, the water changes to black and vice versa. Though, there is no ‘’fall season’’ in the tropical states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, however the key temple tree has a unique characteristic where leaves start to fall during Dakshiyana, and new leaves starts to sprout from march. This is not a typical behavior of a Banyan tree.
Though, the temple was built in the 12th century idols here are quite older than the temple. According to the temple priest, the idol is at least 2,300 years old.  The idol was not installed according to the Agama shastra; it is simply kept on the elevated platform. People offer their prayers every morning and in the evening. Abhishekam to the lord takes place every morning and in the evening. Hence the idol found at the Rameshwaram beach is worshiped here.
It is believed that those who are looking for their soul mates, married couple wishing to have kids throng this temple. By breaking coconut, and offering rice dumplings to the lord, devotees believe their wishes will come true.
The Temple is located at about 700 meters from Mettukadai Bus Stop, 1.5 Kms from Thuckalay, 1 Km from Thuckalay Bus Stand, 4 Kms from Padmanabhapuram, 1 Km from Thiruvithamcode, 12 Kms from Colachel, 14 Kms from Nagercoil, 6 Kms from Eraniel, 40 Kms from Kanyakumari and 58 Kms from Thiruvananthapuram.

Prasanna Venkatachalapathy Temple is a Hindu Temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu located at Gunaseelam in Trichy District of Tamilnadu. It is located on the banks of river Kollidam. This Temple is one of the Abhimana Kshetrams of Lord Vishnu located on the banks of River Cauvery. It is believed that visit to this temple (South Thirupathi) brings abundance of pieties equivalent to Thirupathi Balaji of Andhra Pradesh. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 6:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and three yearly festivals on its calendar. The annual Brahmotsavam (prime festival) is an eleven-day festival attended by thousands of devotees from far and near.
A visit to the temple is believed to be a curative to the mentally challenged people, who are taken to the temple and kept in the temple premises for 48 days. At the end of the 48 days it is believed that their illness is cured by the grace of the presiding deity, Prasanna Venkatachalapathy. The temple has set up a mental health rehabilitation centre that has the official stamp of the Tamil Nadu Government license, the first of its kind in Tamil Nadu. The temple is maintained by a hereditary executive trustee.
This temple remains open from 6.30 AM to 1.00 PM in the morning and 4.00 PM to 8.30 PM in the evenings.
Those suffering from impaired vision, physical disabilities, depression and mental problems pray for remedy in the temple. People also seek mental peace. Devotees perform Tirumanjanam to Lord. Pilgrims with mental illnesses, stay here for 48 days, worship the deity and partake of the prasadam (holy offering) from the temple. They believe that this will cure them. The Thirumanjanam (ablution) ceremony is performed every day in the Gunaseelam Temple and the water is distributed to devotees as a curative elixir.
The temple rituals are performed six times a day; Ushathkalam at 6:30 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:30 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:30 p.m., Thirumalvadai at 5:30 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 8:30 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhisheka (sacred bath), alangaram (decoration), naivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai. Since Tirupathi Lord himself appeared before Gunaseela Maharishi, it is believed that those who are not able to go to Tirupathi can visit Gunaseelam and all their wishes are said to be fulfilled here. During the Uchikalam and Arthajamam, water is sprinkled on devotees, which is believed to expel evil diseases and mental diseases.
The major festival of the temple, Brahmotsavam, is celebrated in the Tamil month of Puratasi (September – October) for 11 days that includes a nine-day chariot festival. The Chitrai Theppotsavam festival is the float festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Chittirai (March – April). The Pavitrotsavam is a three-day festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Aavani, Srirama Navami (Rama’s birthday) in Panguni (March-April) and Gokulastami (Krishna’s birthday) in Aavani (August-September). Unlike other Vishnu temples where Thirumanjanam (ablution) is performed one in a week, the temple has Thirumanjanam performed daily to the central deity.
The Lord appears on his eagle vehicle Garuda on each Tiruvonam star day. Special pujas are performed on Vaikasi Visakam day. Mentally ill people stay here to become normal. During the Uchi Kala Pooja (11:30 AM to 12:30 PM) and Artha Jama Pooja (8:30 PM) the holy water is sprinkled on the devotees which is said to be expiating all kinds of evils effects and mind diseases like depression. This is a Prarthana Sthalam and people wanting to get good marriage and childhood come here and get their wishes sanctioned. The temple is maintained by a hereditary executive trustee.
Etymology:
The name of the place Gunaseelam derives from “Gunam” (meaning cure) and “Seelam” (meaning place), meaning the place in which illness is cured. “Gunam” also means qualities and “Seelam” also means “Assuming a lower position”. Hence Gunaseelam is the place where Vishnu comes down and addresses the devotees problems from his heavenly position.
Greatness of Gunaseelam Temple:
In Bhavishyotra Puranam, one finds reference to the significance of this temple in Gunaseela Mahatmiyam. Thaalpiya Maharishi along with his disciple Gunaseela Rishi once went to the Himalayas. On his way back, Gunaseela Rishi stayed back at Tirupathi and was so attracted to Lord Venkatachalapathy that he wanted the Lord to appear in Gunaseelam and bless the devotees. He came back, bathed in the Cauvery and undertook severe penance here in his ashram in Gunaseelam. Impressed with his sincerity, the Lord appeared before him along with Goddess and promised to remain here till the end of Kali Yugam.
Pleased with the darshan of Prasanna Venkatachalapathy, Gunaseela Maharishi continued to offer his daily poojas to the lord from his ashram here. At the end of the Dwapara Yugam, the Gunaseela Maharishi’s Guru wanted him to go to Naimisaranya. Gunaseela Rishi designated his young disciple to continue the daily poojas. However, floods in the Cauvery and dangerous animals in the forest led the disciple to flee the place and thus the poojas ended abruptly. The Lord decided to hide himself in a pit. After several years, Chola king Nyana Varma, who ruled this place with Uraiyur as the capital, used to visit Gunaseelam regularly.
Every day, cowherds would milk the cows from near the pit and carry the milk all the way back to his court. One day, to everyone’s shock, the milk that was filled to the brim of the pot vanished all of a sudden. An invisible voice wanted the king to dissolve the pit by pouring milk. The king brought in his army and used thousands of litres of milk to complete this exercise. Once dissolved, Vaikunta Vasudevan is said to have appeared before the king as Prasanna Venkatesan. As per the king’s wishes, the Lord agreed to remain here till the end of Kali Yugam and help fulfil all the prayers of the devotees, who visit this temple.
Delighted at the darshan of Prasanna Venkatachalapathy, the king shifted from Uraiyur to Kallur, (this place was then called ‘Badra Chakra Pattinam’) near Gunaseelam and built the beautiful Gunaseelam temple and laid down the process of the daily poojas as directed by Prasanna Venkatesan. He also allocated a lot of land for the temple as well as funds to undertake the daily pooja formalities.
People with physical problem pray here for cure:
It is said that Srudadeva, disciple of Sage Bharadhwaja regained his vision. King Bahuviraja was cured of his paralysis in the legs. Prince of Koorjara kingdom not only was cured of his speech disorder but also became a poet and sung in praise of the Lord. People with any physical problem pray here for cure and mental peace.
Destination for mentally ill people:
This temple is a destination for those mentally ill. Saint Gunaseela was the disciple of Saint Sreethalpya. He was such an adept at serving his Guru that he was bestowed with all the superior knowledge that the Guru possessed. Once Gunaseelar went on a pilgrimage to the Seven Hills and had darshan of Lord Venkateswara. So, moved was he that he pleaded with the Lord to go with him to his Ashram, as he felt that he could not stay away from him anymore.
The Lord who is ever moved by the true love of his devotees spoke to Gunaseelar and told him that as he was in a state of debt, he could not leave Tirumala. He directed Gunaseelar to return to his Ashram on the banks of the Cauvery and do penance. The Lord told the saint that none other than Vaikuntavasa Narayana would appear. Gunaseelar did as the Lord had directed and many years later in Kritha Yuga on Saturday in the month of Purattasi on the day of the star Sravana, Venkatachalapathy appeared in the Ashram of Gunaseelar as a Swayambu.
Gunaseelar was overjoyed and spent his days performing pujas to his Lord. At the time, his guru Sreethalpya wanted to go to Badrinath and perform penance. He however didn’t feel like parting from his dear disciple Gunaseela. Gunaseela could feel the desire of his Guru and also his dilemma. But he was himself in the horns of a dilemma: Whether to go with his Guru and in the process, forsake his dear Lord who came to his abode or to forsake his Guru and stay with his Lord?
The ever-compassionate Narayana was so moved at seeing the predicament of his devotee that when he prayed to Him to clear his mind and make him do the right thing, the Lord blessed his devotee and bade him to serve the guru. Since Venkatachalapathy cleared his mind, Gunaseela made a prayer that all those who pray to win at Gunaseelam should be rid of illusions and delusions and be blessed with clarity of mind. This is why there is a belief that praying at this temple is a cure to insanity and madness.
Equivalent to Thiruppathy:
Since Tirupathi Lord himself appeared before Gunaseela Maharishi, it is believed that those who are not able to go to Tirupathi can visit Gunaseelam and all their wishes are said to be fulfilled here.
Saturday Visit to this Temple:

The Crowd is so much, though the Government made so many arrangements, still it is un-manageable. Luckily for Devotees, nowadays, they are following the traffic rule of left side walking in the road. This helps a lot for the smooth movement, which avoids any complications associated with big crowds.
Still you will find that so many children missing, which is being announced during the festival time in the loud speakers.

Legend has it that Shiva created Kali, out of the poison that he had swallowed, and decreed that he kill Darukasura. Having originated from the Kaalakoota poison, she assumed the name Kaali. Mariamman is believed to be a form of Kaali, and is also known as Mahamayee or Seethala Gowri.
Emperor Dasaratha visited Samayapuram:
There is also a story that Emperor Dasaratha visited Samayapuram to worship Mariamman.
Mariamman: 
Local variations of the worship of Shakti, the mother Goddess are seen throughout the Indian subcontinent. Mariamman is a form of Shakti worshipped in Tamilnadu, and is associated with prosperity and health. Local beliefs associate this deity with cures for diseases such as small pox and chicken pox.
Legendary association with Vikramaditya:
This Temple legend dates back to the period of Vikramaditya. He undertook penance in this Neem Forest and had darshan of kali. It was then that Ambal appeared here as a Swayambu idol.
Headquarters of Amman Temples:
Samayapuram is said to be the headquarters of Amman temples.
Gifts from Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu:
Shiva, Vishnu and Brahmma are believed to have invoked the blessings of Mariamman of Samayapuram. To this day, in memory of this legend, she receives gifts on the day of the Chariot Festival from the Jambukeswarar temple in Thiruvanaikaval. Only after receiving the gifts, does she alight from the Chariot and head back to her sanctum. Similarly, on Thai Poosam day, Amman makes an early morning trip to the Coloroon and stays in the Coloroon in the night and returns the next day only after collecting gifts from her family – Srirangam Lord.
Amman changes Form:
In the middle of the last century, Tamil cinema actors funded the Poochoridal festival. Dhadhyonam was presented to several thousands of devotees who came in from villages across the state. During the Poochoridal festival, one can see the Mariamman in slim and plump forms. During those 28 days true devotees are able to visualize her change from slim to plump form. This was seen as an aakrosham period for her and she is anointed with only Uthiri flowers and not garlands.
Sakthi Peedam:
The reason behind Lord Siva bestowing such powers to cure the dreaded Pox diseases to Devi Samayapuram Mariamman is connected with the Puranic legend in which when Goddess Parvathi committed suicide and her body carried away by Lord Siva. On way wherever parts of her body fell they became Sakthi Peedam. Her eyes reportedly fell in S. Kannanur and when Samayapuram Devi Mariamman manifested as aspect of Goddess Parvathi in S. Kannanur Lord Siva bestowed her with thousand eyes and thus she automatically got the powers to cure the Small Pox and Chicken Pox diseases as the boils of Small Pox and Chicken Pox were likened to smaller eyes of Goddess Parvathi.
Devotees belief and fear on Samayapurathal:
The extent of belief and fear on Goddess Samayapuram Mariamman is so deep that even by mistake if someone casually uttered that they would visit Goddess Samayapuram Mariamman temple to offer prayers for one reason or the other, without fail they would visit the temple at least once in their lifetime to offer prayer to the Goddess even if their prayer had not been fulfilled, lest it will be viewed as insult by the deity and severe problems in many forms will haunt their family or in their own life.
Origin of this Temple:
The origin and history of this temple is unclear and sketchy. Several stories float on its origin, all of which are word of mouth stories only. The deity, believed to have manifested of its own in the form of clay has been reportedly worshipped by the villagers, in the same place which was jungle area several centuries ago. The general belief has been that the then unknown deity, now known as Goddess Samayapuram Mariamman has been worshipped in open area before 1000 years.
The fact that the deity was Goddess Samayapuram Mariamman and manifested there, thousands of years ago as an aspect of Sakthi Devi has been revealed by Devi herself to the devotees through one of the devotees who was possessed by her in the temple festivals. Since the principal deity was of clay, another small deity carved out of stone was has been reportedly made and kept before her to which Abishekam is done and Pooja is performed to ensure the main deity is not damaged.
Deity removed from Srirangam Temple:
The folklore mentions that much before 18th century when the temple did not exist a deity believed to be aspect of Parasakthi (they did not know that it was Goddess Mariamman) was worshipped in the temple of Ranganatha Swamy in Srirangam. But as the Pundit in the temple experienced severe health problems after the idol was installed and he feared that the cause of his problem was due to the deity, he ensured that the deity was removed from there and kept inside the jungle under a tree. The jungle was no other place but Samayapuram then.
The locals in the Village reportedly worshipped Goddess Samayapuram Mariamman as village deity without even knowing the origin, name or other aspect of the female deity they worshipped. Those days out of fear blind belief and worship of self-manifested deities were common. The folklore further mentions that soon when the passersby and travelers felt that the deity in the jungle was protecting them like a guardian deity, they raised a small wall like structure around the idol and converted it into a worship place.
True to their belief ever since the deity began to be prayed, people travelled fear free of robbers and animals. Much beyond protection, the villagers experienced that those who prayed to the deity found their desires getting fulfilled. Those were the days when the local deities in the villages held sway over people.
Vijayanagar Kings built this Temple after winning a War:
As per another lore, the existence of the shrine inside the jungle and the immense power wielded by the deity made people believe that if satisfied with proper offerings and sacrifices she will grant the boons the devotees seek. When this belief spread, the rulers of Vijayanagara emperors who were camping in the district of Tiruchirappalli (which was actually their army base) too reportedly came there to offer prayers and during one of their visits they made commitment to construct a temple if they won the war for which they were camping there and when turned victorious, they constructed the temple in the name of Kannanur Mariamman temple.
Family Deity of Vijayanagara Kings:
There is yet another belief exists. An unnamed female deity was worshipped by the Emperors of Vijayanagara while they were in Trichy, and when they faced defeat in the war that was going on, they began retreating from there and carried the deity too along with them. It was customary for Emperors of Vijayanagara to carry the deity they worshipped wherever they went and camped. On way of retreat, they happened to pass through Samayapuram, which was then a jungle area and rested there for few hours. When they began to move again, the deity could not be lifted from the ground on which it was placed and therefore they had to leave it there after constructing a roofless structure around the deity which later on came to be worshipped by the travelers and passersby seeking her grace and protection. The small roofless structure was converted into a big temple for Goddess Samayapuram Mariamman by the later rulers.
Story behind building this Temple:
One of the legends in many such stories floating state that, once during the invasion of a Muslim ruler, the idol worshipped by the locals was forcibly taken away by the invaders to break it in their land before their King. On way when they reached a Canal, they kept the idol and other belongings on the bank of the Canal and rested for a while to get freshened up. After taking bath in the Canal, they returned back to commence the travel, but found that the idol was missing while all other belongings were safe. Even after searching the entire area they could not find the idol and therefore the frustrated solders went away without further searching for the idol.
Few days after the soldiers moved away, some of the villagers found the deity inside a bush surrounded by Neem trees and fearing that the deity could be powerful, they began worshiping the deity in the same place after cleaning the surroundings. Nobody knew how the idol went and hid into the bush. When one of the rulers named Vijaya Ranga Chokkanathar of Vijayanagar came to know of the greatness of the unknown deity, he constructed a temple for the goddess in Samayapuram and consecrated the idol inside the temple after realizing from his Raja guru that the deity was aspect of Parasakthi. Thus, came the temple of Goddess Samayapuram Mariamman says the devotees.
The Temple is located at about 1.5 kms from Adhi Mariamman Temple, 500 meters from Samayapuram New Bus Stand, 350 meters from Samayapuram Temple Old Bus Stand, 6 Kms from Manachanallur, 12 Kms from Thiruvellarai, 12 Kms from Thiruppainjeeli, 12 Kms from Pachur, 11 Kms from Srirangam, 9 Kms from Thiruvanaikoil and 16 Kms from Trichy.

It is believed that Raja Raja Chola’s sister, Kunthavai, desired to construct a temple for Lord Muruga and while moving the idols in a bullock cart, the cart got stuck in the mud and would not move. A decision was then taken by her to build the temple in this place.
This Temple is an east facing Shiva temple where the beautiful and rare south facing Lord Subramanyaswamy (Muruga) is more popular. The entrance is through an arch gate in the south and Lord Muruga is visible from his shrine as you enter. Lord Subramanya with his six faces is sitting on an elegant peacock. His concerts Valli is seated on his left and Devayani is seated on his right. Both of them are seated in their own separate peacock.
To see Lord Muruga, Valli and Devayani in three different peacocks is a unique sight which you can only witness in Thinniyam.

Resurrection of Manmatha:
This Temple is especially connected with the legend of Manmathan. Shiva had burnt Manmatha to ashes after he tried to divert his attention by aiming arrows of love at him. A grief struck Rathi Devi prays to Shiva to restore her husband back to life. It is here that Rathi Devi got back Manmatha, the God of Love, by praying to Thirumoolanathar. As Manmathan is believed to have sugarcane bow and flower arrow, he is also known as Poovaliyan and this place came to be known as Puvaliur which in due course, became Puvalur or Poovalur.
Place for Salvation:
This is also an ancient temple where Brahma, Indra, Agni and Manmathan attained salvation.
Gnanapureeswarar:

Equivalent to Gaya:
Another legend relates to the river Phalguni flowing near the temple. A rishi wanted to perform rituals for his ancestors. As there was no river at that time, he thought of performing it at Gaya. Before leaving this place, he prayed to Shiva in this temple and the Lord threw his anklet (Silambu in Tamil) and Ganges started flowing. Hence those who are unable to proceed to Gaya for Sraddha ceremony, perform it here. This legend is similar to the legend in Samavedeeswarar temple in Thirumangalam.
Poovalur:
As per the legend, the Devas sought help of Manmatha (Kamadeva) to awaken Shiva, who was in deep meditation. They wanted Shiva to protect them by fighting the Asuras. As they did not have guts to approach the Lord themselves, they persuaded Manmatha to perform this task. Manmatha released flower arrows from his bow aiming at Shiva. The flowers hit Shiva and he turned very furious. He opened his third eye and turned Manmatha into ashes. It is believed that Manmatha released his flower arrows from this village and hence this village is called as Poovalur. The word “Poo” in Tamil language means the flower.
Manmathapuram:
Manmatha’s wife Rathi worshiped Shiva in this village and got him back alive. Hence, this village is also called as Manmathapuram.

Mahabali built this Temple:
When the emperor Mahabali took his army towards Mysore for war, he took rest on the way on a sand dune. At that time, the Lord Perumal appeared in his dream and said that on that spot under the earth there was an idol of the Lord. The Lord instructed the king to unearth the idol and build a temple there. He also blessed the king and said that he would be victorious. After the king got up, he excavated the idol, installed it, built a temple and worshipped there. He established a village there and named it “Tirunarayanapuram”. He granted the lands and the village to the temple’s name and then went to Mysore for war and was very victorious.
Lord appeared as Shantha Swaroopa Moorthy to Prahaladha here:
Lord Vishnu took the Narasimha Avatar to save Prahaladha and to slaughter demon Hiranyakasipu. When Prahaladha requested to the Lord to give him Dharshan in his composed state, Perumal ordered him to come to Thiru Narayanapuram. Accordingly, the Lord appears as Shantha Swaroopa Moorthy and blesses the devotees who come to worship him here. Lord Vishnu also promised a place for Prahalad near his feet – another unique feature seen at this temple is a 3-year-old boy Prahaladha in a standing posture at the feet of the sleeping Lord.
Vedic Initiation to Brahmma:
Brahmma once turned arrogant as he was the only one who could ‘create’ things in this world. Wanting to teach him a lesson, Lord Vishnu created a unique idol that left Brahmma wondering about its creator. When asked, Lord Vishnu feigned ignorance saying that Brahmma was the only one bestowed with the rights of creation. While agreeing to this, Brahmma questioned the Lord as to who could have created this image and how this could have appeared without his knowledge and approval.
Lord Vishnu brought the truth before Brahmma and a message to the people at large saying that we should do what is expected of us. However, we should not become arrogant as a result of the exclusive/ special powers given to us. Realizing his folly, Brahmma requested Lord Narayana for the initiation of the Vedas. Lord Narayana is believed to have appeared before him here at Thiru Narayanapuram and undertaken the Vedic initiation.
As he initiated the Vedic lessons to Brahmma, the Lord is referred to here as ‘Veda Narayanan’. Having played the role of an Acharya and Brahmma having been a student/disciple of Lord Vishnu, this temple is said to be a ‘Guru’ and ‘Budhan’ Sthalam.
Other Names:
This place which is now called as “Thiru Narayanapuram” was known as ‘Chathur Vedhi Mangalam’, ‘Vedapuri’ and ‘Aadhi Rangam’ in the past.
Pillai Thiru Naraiyur Abhimana Kshetram:
Thiru Naraiyur Araiyar came here with his wife and 6 children in the hope of finding Moksham. One night, the leaves from the palm tree at the temple caught fire. Shocked at seeing this, Thiru Naraiyur Araiyar immediately threw his 6 children towards the Lord as a cover for him and to protect him from the raging flames. Unfortunately, the Lord continued to burn. Araiyar then threw himself into the flames and hugged the Lord so the fire would not touch his favourite Lord. Pleased with his devotion, the Lord appeared before him and granted Moksham to the entire family of the Araiyar. Hence, this place came to be called Pillai Thiru Naraiyur Abhimana Kshetram.
Success in Education:
Veda Narayana Perumal of Thiru Narayanapuram is said to help devotees in their education and learning. As Brahmma himself was initiated with Vedic Education, this is a special temple on the education front. Students/ children who visit this temple offering their sincere prayers and place their books at the feet of Veda Narayanan are believed to come out with flying colours in their education.
Sri Ramanuja in saffron: 
When Sri Ramanuja visited the place, Lord advised him to have a dip in Cauvery and come back dressed in saffron. Ramanuja did accordingly. The Acharya comes in procession in saffron on Tiruvadhirai star day in the month of Chithirai, April-May. He is dressed in white on other days.

https://www.bharattemples.com/kurathiyarai-cave-temple-thovalai-kanyakumari/,"Kurathiyarai Cave Temple, Thovalai, Kanyakumari
The worship of Avvaiyar in Thovalai taluk in Kanyakumari district is locally as Avvai Nonbu or Avvai Vratham. The Tuesdays of Tamil month Adi is most auspicious for Avvaiyar worship. Womenfolk offer Kozhukkattai (steam boiled rice ball with sweet stuffing) to Avvaiyaaramman. From inscriptions from Chitharal mountain, there was a Jain cave temple at the top of Chitharal mountain and was known as Thiru Charanathu Malai.  The monks belonging to the Digambara sect established Thiru Charanathu Palli – the abode of Jain monks during 9th century A.D.
Thiru Charanathu Palli was a dynamic center of Jain learning – a monastery and a school. The male teacher was called Kuravar and the female teacher Kurathi. The word Kurathi also denotes a Jain nun. Influence of Jainism in Kurathiyarai is evident from the first syllable Kurathi. The inscription also cites the Ay king Vikramaditya Varaguna (885-925 AD). The scholars assign the date of the cave to 8th century A.D.
The south facing rock cut cave is excavated on the slope of the hillock at the outskirts of the village. The cave cell is excavated 0.95 cm in width and 1.77 m in height and east-west in orientation. The entrance is 80 cm in width and 1.30 m in height. Local people made provision for wooden door and walls coated with cement. The horse shoe shaped cave excavation remains incomplete and the floor, roof and walls of the cave appear coarse. The sanctum is 1.52 m in east-west in length and 1.13 m north- south in width and 2.04 m in height. The niche carved on the rear wall measures 40 cm in height. The niche, flanked by two square pilasters, houses Lord Vishnu.
The pilasters support the angular potika and uttira.  The prastara including vajanam, valabi and kapota are absent. Lord Vishnu image appears in samapatha sthanaka posture on the rear wall and image is dull and smudged with oil. The Lord wears krita makuta, kundala ear-ring, Yagnopavita (sacred cord) runs across his chest, and drapes dhoti as a fivefold tuck in wrap (Pankacha) and the waist cloth (Idaikattu) is tucked with knot. He holds the chanku (conch) in his back-right hand and his back-left hand holds Chakra (disc wheel). His right forearm rests on the hip and the left forehand kept half folded. Scholars assign the date of Vishnu as eighth century A.D.
Two niches are carved outside on the rock slope one on each side of the cave entrance. The niche on the west of the entrance is 89 cm in height and 63 cm in width and houses Vinayagar idol. The Vinayagar is seated in posture described as ‘Lalitasana’ (posture of royal ease) with his right leg drawn up and folded and the left leg resting on the ground. The Lord in Lalitasana represents a calm and relaxed deity and the idol appear with trunk to the right side is known as valampuri Vinayagar. The Lord wears karanda-makutam, sarapali in the neck, armlets, bracelets and short robe around the waist. The right tusk is present while left tusk is absent.
The back-left hand is damaged and the back-right hand shows kapitha mudra. The right fore-hand holds an object which is not unidentifiable and left forehand rests on the lap. The image on eastern niche is left incomplete and sculpting do not show any shape. However, the local people worship this image as Avvaiyar.  Although the presiding deity in this cave is Vishnu, the temple is locally known as Avvaiyaaramman Temple. The image on the left side of Lord Vishnu is believed to be that of Avvai.

The Temple remains open from 5.30 am to10 am and 5 pm to 8 pm.
Annual festival is a 10-day festival in the month of Medam (April /May). Vaikasi Visakam is also an important celebration here. On the 9th day of Vaikasi Visakam festival, Devi is decorated by all Aparana (jewels). She goes around the temple for Palli Vetta (hunting). The idol is taken 7 times around the temple. The bow and arrow after the ritual is gifted to some devotee. There is no Devi Aaraattu. 5 days prior to Tirukarthika day in the Vrischikam month (Nov/Dec), Thiruvonam, Navarathri, Pongala during Pongal (Jan) are the other main festivals here. Kalabha chaarthu is done on all days in Karthikai month is famous here.
Valvachagostam:
It is believed that Parasurama, who had killed his mother Renuka to satisfy the wishes of his father, wanted his sin to be forgiven. So, on the advice of Brahmins he went to Himalayas. He left his sword in his village (Val = sword, Vacha = keeping, Goshtam = temple). There the Chera King is said to have constructed a big temple at this place and dedicated it to the Goddess Bhagavathi.
Srikoil and Marudha Mandapam:
The story goes that Kalisankara Variyar (belonging to the ambalavaasi community – serving the temple) was an ardent Devi devotee and a tantric too. He was working as an accountant to Edathara Potti who was well known in this belt at that time. One-day Variyar was returning home late after work. He found two beautiful ladies crossing him in the night. He could identify that they were not normal ladies, but were divine beings. He gave them a seat beneath the nearby Marutha tree and left the place assuring that he will get a temple for the two beings.
The two were Mahishasura Mardini and her friend Yakshi. He consulted Edathara Potti and with the help of Venadu king, the temple was erected. The main deity was Mahishasura Mardini and the Yakshi was offered a place in the north-east part of the temple, within the naalambalam. The place where Variyar initially made the two to wait is a four pillar mandapam. Twice in a year – during Tirukarthika and during the annual 10-day festival, the Yakshi gets offerings.
On Tirukarthika, Devi is escorted from this mandapam into the temple with an elaborate ritual. This is done by a young girl, less than 12 years old, from the ambalavaasi family who must fast and observe Vratham for 48 days. It is believed that the Devi comes with the girl from the mandapam to the temple. Tulabaram, Nava kalasa puja, and Devi avahana puja (tantric puja) are done in this mandapam. Hence the sanctity of the temple is equally distributed to both the places, the main Srikoil and this Marudha mandapam. This is a very rare phenomenon found in this temple, that we rarely see anywhere else.
The Temple is located at about 2.5 Kms from Samiyar Madam, 2.5 Kms from Samiyarmadam Bus Stop, 3 Kms from Palliyadi, 7 Kms from Marthandam, 8 Kms from Thiruvattaru, 14 Kms from Kulasekharam, 9.5 Kms from Thuckalay, 12 Kms from Padmanabhapuram, 12 Kms from Kuzhithurai, 15 Kms from Colachel, 24 Kms from Nagercoil, 44 Kms from Kanyakumari and 53 Kms from Thiruvananthapuram.

The incident of how Mahaperiyava took over as the 68th Peetathipathi is an interesting legend. The 67th Peetathipathi was the only son of the widowed and destitute sister of Paramacharya’s mother. There was no one in Kalavai at that time to console her on her son assuming the Sanyasa Asrama. So Paramacharya’s mother with 13 years old Swaminathan (the pre Sanyasa name of Paramacharya) and other children started for Kalavai to console her sister. They travelled by train to Kanchipuram and halted at the Sankara Mutt there. A carriage of the Kalavai Mutt came there to buy articles for the Maha Pooja on the 10th day after the passing away of the 66th Acharya.
A hereditary Maistry of Kalavai Mutt, asked Paramacharya to accompany him alone with a separate cart engaged for the rest of the family to follow them.
During the journey, the Maistry started with a hint that Paramacharya might have to spend the rest of his life in the Mutt itself and then gradually began to clarify that the present Acharya, Paramacharya’s cousin, had fever which developed into delirium and that was why Paramacharya was being separated from the family to be quickly taken to Kalavai. T
he Maistry was commissioned to go to Thindivanam, where Paramacharya was studying, but was able to meet Paramacharya at Kanchipuram itself. Paramacharya was stunned and was repeating “Rama Rama” during the rest of the journey. Paramacharya’s mother later only found that instead of her mission of consoling her sister, she herself was placed in the state of having to be consoled by someone else. It is said that Paramacharya once set foot in the Kalavai mutt, the 67th Peetathipathi also attained Siddhi after 7 days of heading the mutt, as if was just waiting for Paramacharya to arrive.
So, the young Swaminathan had no Guru at the time of initiation and sat in between the Adhistanams of the two Gurus to be ordained as the 68th Peetathipathi. Surprisingly, a Tulsi plant is growing in the stone slab on which Paramacharya sat and took initiation. It is said that Paramacharya appeared in the dream of the Mutt Manager not to remove the plant since he Himself is present there.
The Kanchi Mutt is located at about 500 meters from Kalavai Bus Stop, 5 Kms from Kalavai Koot Road Bus Stop, 23 Kms from Arcot, 24 Kms from Ranipet, 25 Kms from Arani, 22 Kms from Cheyyar, 39 Kms from Kanchipuram, 46 Kms from Vellore and 118 Kms from Chennai.

Swarnakadeswarar:
Once the place was very fertile with paddy fields and people were happy and prosperous. Wealth and luxuries made people forget God. Lord directed Varuna the God of rain to pour his power incessantly in the region. Heavy floods began to threaten their safety. Lakes, tanks and all water resources began to breach. People ran to Lord for safety. Lord came as a youth, asked the people to bring all the paddy bags from their homes and built a dam preventing further calamity. Though the people lost their possessions, they praised the youth as their saviour.
He said that God was the giver of prosperity and they should not be ungrateful to the Almighty. The young man gave them pots of gold (Swarna) and advised them to recover the loss by using it and disappeared. When the villagers were wonderstruck, Lord appeared before them as Swayambu. People built the temple then. As the Lord gave them Swarna-gold, He is praised as Swarnakadeswarar.

As the guru of Sri Ram, Vasishtar gave a collection of advices which was written down and codified as the ‘Gnana Vasishtam’. This is similar to the Bhagavad Geeta which contains dialogue between Arjuna and Lord Krishna.

https://www.bharattemples.com/othandeeswarar-temple-thirumazhisai-thiruvallur/,"Othandeeswarar Temple, Thirumazhisai, Thiruvallur
Othandeeswarar Temple is a Hindu Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva located at Thirumazhisai Town near Chennai City in Thiruvallur District of Tamilnadu. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple was built during the 11th century by Chola king Kulothunga Chola II. Shiva is worshipped as Othandeeswarar and his consort Parvathi as Kulirvithanayaki. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple has a five-tiered Rajagopuram, the gateway tower. The Vijayanagar and Nayak kings made further expansion to the temple during the 16th century. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.
The temple has many inscriptions from the Chola period during the 11th century. Kulothunga Chola II is believed to have built the temple and the shrines in the current form. The temple exists before 11th century and Somaskandar believed to be of Pallava Period. Historians believe that the shrine of Vishnu seems to be later addition. The Vijayanagara kings, who ruled the region, have done benevolent endowments to the temple. Sengunda Mudaliyars built many shrines in the temple and refurbished the tank. The samprokshanam was performed in 1995. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.
Kai Thandha Piran:
Chola king Karikal Peruvalathan was proceeding on his elephant to worship Shiva in another place. On the way, one leg of the elephant was caught in a creeper. Despite efforts, it could not pull out from the bush. The king tried his hands to remove the bush but could not. He began cutting the bush with his sword which began to bleed. Shocked king, found a Shiva Linga hidden under the bushes. Realizing that he had offended the Lord, he unhesitatingly cut his hand with the same sword when Lord appeared before him with Mother on his Nandi and fixed the hand as before.
Remembering the event, Lord is praised as Kai Thandha Piran – Lord who gave hands. Lord consoled the king. The presiding deity at the temple is still believed to have a scar on it. Mother narrated to king the stories of Shiva devotees and cooled his mind. Kulirvithal in Tamil in this context means cooling the sorrows of devotees, hence, she is praised as Kulirvitha Nayaki.
Thirumazhisai:
As this place was full of Azhinjal trees, it was called as Azhisai in olden days. Later, after God took abode here, the word ‘Thiru’ was added to it and came to be known as ‘Thiru Azhisai’, which later corrupted to become ‘Thirumazhisai’.
Sage Agasthiyar worshipped Lord Shiva under Azhinjal Tree:
During the Shiva Parvathi wedding ceremony at Kailash, all the Devas, Gods, Rishis and Ganas gathered to witness the holy event. As everyone gathered at the North, that is Kailash, the whole earth tilted to one side towards North, because of the weight. To balance the Bhoomi, Lord Shiva directed Sage Agasthiyar to go to the southern part of the country. As Sage Agasthiyar felt sad that he would miss seeing the holy wedding of Lord Shiva and Parvathi, Lord Shiva granted him a boon that, from wherever Agasthiyar worships him, he would get the Dharshan of God’s complete wedding ceremony.
While traveling in Southern region, Sage Agasthiyar worshipped Lord Shiva at Velankaadu (today’s Thiruverkadu), where he wished to see Sri Shiva Parvathi wedding ceremony. The Lord too gave Dharshan of the whole wedding ceremony to Agasthiyar there. On realizing this, Pulasthiyar, who is the primary disciple of Agasthiyar and all other disciples, requested Agasthiyar that they too wish to see the wedding of the Lord.
Sage Agasthiyar along with his disciples came walking towards south of Thiruverkadu and stayed in this place, which was a forest filled with Azhinjal trees. As Azhinjal tree is considered most sacred, Sage Agasthiyar installed a Shiva Lingam and worshipped Lord Shiva here. God, pleased with Agasthiyar’s prayers again gave Dharshan of His wedding ceremony to Agasthiyar and all his disciples.
Sage Agasthiyar overwhelmed by the mercy of the God, requested God to take abode in this place in Kalyana Kolam (posture as just wed couple). As wished by Agasthiyar, Lord Shiva and Parvathi took abode here as Uma Maheshwara just behind the Shiva Lingam, worshipped by Agasthiyar. There are 3 places of then ‘Thondai Mandalam’, where Sage Agasthiyar had worshipped Lord Shiva under Azhinjal tree. They are Azhisoor near Kanchipuram, Thirumazhisai near Poonamallee and Chinnakkaavanam near Ponneri. The divine coincidence is all the 3 temples lie on a straight line.
The temple remains open from 6.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. and 4.30 p.m. to 9.00 p.m.
It is believed that people who are left helpless in life, when prayed to lord here gets a helping hand from him, for sure. The faith is strong among the devotees that unity among the couple would be closer if they worship Lord Nataraja and Mother Ambica both looking at each other ensuring happiness in life. People pray for mental peace and forgiveness for wrongs committed. Devotees perform special pujas to Lord offering vastras.
The temple follows Saivite tradition. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Shaivite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasanthi at 8:30 a.m., Uchikalam at 11:30 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., and Sayaratchai between 8:00 – 8:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Othandeeswarar and Kulirvithanayaki. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple.

Lord Vishnu slaying of Bhasmasura:
As per Hindu legend, once a demon by name Bhasmasura did penance. Shiva granted him a boon that when he touches anyone’s head, the person would turn to ashes. Bhasmasura wanted to test the boon and wanted to touch the head of Shiva. A bewildered Shiva ran to seek the favour of Vishnu, who took the form of damsel Mohini. She lured Bhasmasura with her dance and made Bhasmasura touch his head with his hand. The demon Bhasmasura was thus defeated. The place where Mohini lured (meaning Moham) came to be known as Thirumohur.
Thirumohur:
According to another legend, there was a fight between the Devas (gods) and Asuras (demons) during the churning of the Ocean of Milk for Amrita (ambrosia). Asuras were able to overpower Devas and the Devas sought Vishnu’s help. Vishnu appeared as Mohini to lure the asuras and gave them empty pot. The word ‘Moham’ in Sanskrit means attraction or desire. As Vishnu took the Mohini form, this place became Thirumohanavur that later was shortened to Thirumohur.
Place for salvation:
The great Vaishnavite saint Nammalwar prayed to all Perumals in the 108 Divyadesas, but Kalamega Perumal of this temple only took the Alwar to salvation.  Hence, once a devotee prays to Kalamega Perumal in this temple, his /her seat in the other world – Vaikunta – is ensued.
Other Names:
It is also known as Mohanapuram and Mohanakshetram.
Thirupaarkadal:
As the legend goes, when the devas were churning the ocean for Amruta, a drop of that Amruta is believed to have fallen into this temple tank and the lord appeared to the south of this tank. Hence it is also known as Periya Thirupaarkadal and Siriya Thirupaarkadal.
People worshipped Lord Vishnu here:
Sage Pulasthya, Brahmma, Indiran and Ajaruthar are said to have had darshan of the lord here.
Birth of Ayyapan:
Lord Shiva too got attracted towards the beauty of Mohini and as a result of this only, Lord Ayyappan was born from the third eye of Lord Shiva.
Mohana Kshetram:
In centuries gone by, this place was identified as being 1 Yojana from Thirumaliruncholai and South of the Elephant rock. The huge Ashta Giri can be seen even today. It is worth stopping on the highway (Madurai-Madras route) to see this elephant shaped rock that runs quite a distance.
Kalamega Perumal:
Lord Vishnu helped recover the Vedic Scriptures from two Asuras – Madhu and Kaidapan who had stolen it from Brahmma. It was at this place that Brahmma performed daily poojas, directed at Lord Vishnu, as a gesture to thank the Lord for fighting the Asuras and securing back the Vedic Scriptures. It is said that Brahmma wanted to see the Lord as ‘Narayana’ and not in his Mohini form. Hence, it is said that Lord Vishnu appeared before Brahmma at this place as Kalamega Perumal.
Marga Bandhu:
Kalamega Perumal is said to be a close friend of the devotees and is said to be one who provides direction and guides the devotees who come to him for Moksham. Hence, he is also referred to as ‘Maarga Bandhu’.
Thirupaarkadal Nathan:
Wanting to see the Lord churning the ocean to secure the nectar, Sage Pulasthiyar undertook penance here. Pleased with his prayers, Lord appeared before him and gave him darshan. Hence there is a separate sannidhi for the Lord as ‘Thirupaarkadal Nathan’.

The Koodal Alagar Temple is one of those two temples to have this unique feature. This temple is very important as the Tiruppallaandu, the first 12 verses of the 4000 Divyapprabhandhams, was sung by Periyalwar here in this temple praising the splendor of Azhagar. The temple is an ancient one and situated near the famous Meenakshi Amman Temple. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.

Thiru Pallandu:
As per Hindu legend, Pandya king Vallabhadeva wanted to know the Lord with the power to show the way to Paramapatha, the heavenly abode. The King hung a Golden Parrot with the announcement that the parrot would automatically fall, once someone informs him of the right Lord to Paramapatha. Several came and went back without success. It is believed that the Koodal Lord appeared in the dreams of Vallabhadeva’s priest Selva Nambi and suggested the name of Periazhwar of Srivilliputhur. Accordingly, Periazhwar was brought to the court of the Pandya King in Madurai.
With several examples from vedic scriptures as well as historical references, Periazhwar showcased to the Pandya King that Lord Vishnu was the Lord who could take one to the heavenly abode. And to every one’s surprise the parrot fell down. The Azhvaar taken on a Street procession in Koodal. A delighted Pandya king praised Periazhwar and took him on an elephant procession through the streets of Madurai. Legend has it that Koodal Azhagar himself came to see this sight on his Garuda Vahanam.
Delighted at the sight of the Koodal Lord, Periazhwar showered praises with his Pallaandu. Hence, Koodal Azhagar is credited with origination of Thiru Pallaandu, which now has come to be sung as the first 12 songs of the Divya Prabhandham. Being the place where Periazhwar sang the now famous Pallaandu, this place is considered equivalent to Paramapatham.

It is said that architect of the Devas (gods), Vishwakarma designed and constructed Koodal Azhagar Koil in Kritha Yugam (Sathya or age of truth), the first of the four epochs in Vedic history. The other three are Tretha Yugam, Dwapara Yugam and the current one called Kali Yugam.
Koodal:
Koodal is the ancient name for Madurai. Azhagar means the beautiful one (male form) in Tamil.
Legend has it that all the Gods and Goddesses got together at the Koodal Azhagar Temple, for Meenakshi Amman’s wedding to Lord Sundareswarar. Hence this place is called as Koodal.
The name Koodal stems from the legend that at the behest of Vishnu, four clouds gathered at Madurai in the form of tall buildings, and prevented a deluge from overpowering the city.
The legend says that 49 Tamil poets joined their hands to form an academy under the order of Pandya king to promote the growth of Tamil language. The academy which was formed by them stood as a center for the welfare of Tamil language for several centuries making numerous valuable works for the growth of Tamil. The academy stands as a monument for today.
It is said that four buildings are joined together to form a fort to prevent the place from intense deluge. Even this was served as a reason for the name “Koodal”, as four building joined to form a fort at this place.
The other mythology was that four clouds are sent by Lord Indra, the god of rain, because of the worship made by a Pandya king pleasing for rain. As a result, the four clouds sent by Lord Indra joined at this place causing rain. Hence, the four clouds joined at this place, it is called as “Koodal”, where Koodal means joining.
Reference in Maduraikkanchi:
In praise of Sri Koodal Azhagar, the Avani Onam festival was celebrated by Pandyan rulers for seven days. This festival is described in Maduraikkanchi, one of the ten epic poems called Pathupattu of the Sangam period.
Reference in Silapathikaram:
Illangovadigal (the Tamil poet who wrote the epic ‘Silapathikaram’) praises Lord Koodal Azhagar as ‘Needu Neer-Vaigai Nedumal’, meaning the Lord who covered the Universe by taking three strides, and then settled down at the bank of the River Vaigai in this temple.
Reference in Brahmanda Purana:
Brahmanda Purana vividly describes this Kshetra in seven chapters.
The Pandya Symbol:
A Pandiyan king by named Sathyaviradhan, devoted to this Koodal Azhagar and had a great belief towards him. One day, when he went to worship Koodal Azhagar. But before going into the temple, he washed his hands in the Kirutha Maala river, where a fish was found in his hand. He thought that the fish might be the Lord Vishnu. Since fish was one of the Avathars of Sri Vishnu. This is stated to be the reason for the Pandyas to have ‘Fish’ as their symbol in their flags.
Vaigai And Kritha Mala:
At Sathya Logam, Brahmma washed the legs of Lord Vishnu, after his Trivikrama Avatharam, the sacred water drops of which fell on Madurai. These sacred drops spread as two rivers, Vaigai and Krithumala. Koodal Azhagar temple is on the banks of Krithumala river.
People worshipped Lord Vishnu here:
Legendary Kings Prithu and Malayadwaja Pandya Koodal Alagar, who bestowed them with prosperity and attainment of moksha at the end.
Koodal Azhagar Temple is situated in the heart of the city. The Temple is located at about 450 meters from Complex Bus Stand, 1 Km from Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple, 400 meters from Periyar Bus Stand, 7 Kms from Mattuthavani Integrated Bus Terminus, 7 Kms from Thiruparankundram, 1 Km from Madurai Railway Junction, 20 Kms from Thirumangalam and 10 Kms from Madurai International Airport.

The temple follows the traditions of the Thenkalai sect of Vaishnavite tradition and follows Vaikasana Aagama. In modern times, the temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. Seven poojas or services are performed every day. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Koodal Azhagar and Maragathavalli.
During the last step of worship, nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple celebrates festivals on 253 days of the year. The fourteen-day annual Brahmotsavam during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May – June) is the most prominent festival of the temple. The festive images of the temple are brought in chariot round the streets of the temple in various mounts during all the fourteen days. The Dasavatharam, the ten reincarnation stories are enacted.

Ten days are celebrated as Karthikai Utsavam (festivities in the month of Karthika), in honour of Thirumangai Alwar, who performed the Mangala Sasanam (or sang the poems in praise of the Lord) of the temple. The Vaikunta Vaasal, the symbolic gateway to the spiritual world, is kept open every year on the 24th morning of the month of Karthikai. “Ra Paththu” is a ten-day celebration that begins on the night of Ekadashi, when a hundred of the four thousand Pasurams (verses of poems composed by Alwars) are sung, every night. Two hundred Pasurams are sung every day for the next ten days and this is known as Pagal Paththu, the rest of the thousand songs are sung on the final day of the celebration. Female energy is harnessed on this night, as the Lord is adorned in the Nachiyar Thirukolam. (Where the Lord puts on the attire of Mahalakshmi). Another unique festival is the Vedu Pari Utsavam during which accounts of the temple are submitted to the Lord Himself.

Andarkuppam:
As he came to this place as a poor little boy (Aandi), the place was called Aandiarkuppam which later changed as Andarkuppam. As Andar means ruler, the name Andarkuppam appears to be an appropriate name.
Lord Murugan taught Pranava to Brahmma:
Subramanya Swamy asked the meaning of Pranava which Brahma was not able to answer and Lord Muruga taught Brahmma about Pranava. We see a small stone outside the sanctum in front of Subramanya Swamy temple which is considered as Brahma. We can see the carving of the story in one of the pillars here in the temple.
Murugan created a spring with his Vel here:
In the past some poor people (Aandi) were worshipping him. A devotee on his pilgrimage stayed here and wanted to have a bath and worship the Lord and asked the Aandis for a river or well. They said there is none such nearby. A little boy came there, took the traveler to a place and punched the earth with Vel at a place. A spring came up and the traveler’s joy knew no bounds. Lord Muruga granted darshan to him and stayed as Lord Balasubramanya.

Kasi Viswanathar Temple is a Hindu Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva located at Palaiyur Village in Tirupattur near Siruganur in Trichy District of Tamilnadu. This temple is very close to Thirupattur Brahma Temple. This temple with a sacred tank was constructed by Cholas. The Jeeva samadhi of Sage Vyagrapada (Pulikkal Siddhar) is located within the temple.
Temple Pond created by Saint Vyagrapada:
Vyagrapathar, who had feet of a tiger, was said to have lived here for some time tending to the lord. Once during a drought when he could not get water to bath the Lingam he asked Indra on his white elephant, who used to pass overhead with water from Mount Kailash every day for the lord at Thiruvanaikaval to spare some. This was refused and the sage in anger dug the ground with his clawed feet to bring forth the Theertham of Ganges here – Pulipaichi Theertham. When Indra and his mount reached Thiruvanaikaval late after this episode the lord asked for the reason. When appraised he immediately directed them to provide the water to the sage which was duly rejected by him now. The elephant then performed the ablution to the deity itself. This scene is depicted in the Gopuram.
Curse of Ayyanar:
As per local legend, Ayyanar cursed all the Brahmins in this village many hundred years ago that their livelihood will be stopped. Slowly all the temples died due to want of maintenance and the priests all migrated. Since the temples have now been redone and the Kumbabishekam of the Ayyanar also arranged hoping for better days.
Jeeva Samadhi:
Vyagrapada, that is, one having the feet like a tiger, was one of the mythical rishis (sage) of ancient India. His image and iconography depicts him as a human being but with the legs of a tiger.

Taken From: https://tamilnadu-favtourism.blogspot.com/2018/03/thiruneermalai-dhivya-desam-kanchipuram.html
Thiruneermalai Dhivya Desam is a Hindu Temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu located in Thiruneermalai, a suburb of Chennai in Kanchipuram District of Tamilnadu. Thiruneermalai Dhivya Desam is one among the 108 Divya Desams of Perumal. There are two temples, one at the top of the hill and other in the foothills. In all, the temple occupies an area of 15 acres (6.1 ha). At Thiruneermalai, one finds Lord Vishnu in four forms – Sitting, Sleeping and Walking posture atop the hill and Standing posture in the temple at the foot of the hill.
While the presiding deity is Neervanna Perumal, all Utsavams (Celebrations) are for Lord Ranganatha. Thiruneermalai Dhivya Desam is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabhandham, a great Tamil canon, and the hymns were sung by Thirumangai Azhwar and Boothathazhar. This temple is considered as Mukthi Sthala. Thiruneermalai area is one of the 163 notified areas (megalithic sites) in the state of Tamil Nadu.
Ranganatha appearing as Lord Rama due to Sage Valmiki penance:
As per Hindu legend, sage Valmiki, after composing the epic Ramayana, worshipped Ranganatha at the top of the hill. When he came downhills, Valmiki is said to have missed the presence of Lord Raama at foot hills and is said to have undertaken penance thinking of Lord Raama. Due to his penance, Ranganatha appeared as Lord Rama, Lakshmi appeared as Sita, Adi Sesha appeared as Lakshmana, Vishnu’s shankha as Bharatha, Sudarshana chakra as Shatrugna, Garuda in the form of Hanuman and Vishwakarma as Sugreeva.
Thirumangai Azhwar 6 month wait:
Thiru Mangai Azhvaar came here to sing praise of the Lord but heavy rains flooded the place and he could not reach this temple. Having come this far, he decided to wait till the rains stopped. It proved to be a long wait of 6 months before Thiru Mangai could meet his Lord. The hill on which he stayed during these 6 months still exists and is called Thiru Mangai Azhvaar Puram. This is the only Divya Desam where Thiru Mangai waited this long to meet the Lord.
One has seen in the stories relating to a few of the other Divya Desams where Thiru Mangai has left/threatened to leave without waiting for the Lord. Pleased with his devotee, Perumal granted four darshans to Azhwar – Neer Vanna Perumal standing, Narasimha sitting, Ranganatha reclining and Ulagalandha Perumal in walking postures.  The devotee can enjoy these darshans in the temple.  Lord Neervanna Perumal is at the foot of the hills while Ranganatha, Narasimha and Ulagalandha Perumal are at the hill temple.
Utsavar goes up the hill only thrice a year:
The Utsavar deity of Ranganatha is seen at the Neer Vannan temple at the foot of the hill. Only thrice a year – on the first and last day of Brahmotsavam festival and on the Panguni Uthiram day – is he taken up the hill to be alongside the Moolavar Lord Ranganatha.
Madhya Rangam:
This place is called Madhya Rangam and Lord Ranganatha is seen in Bhoga Sayanam.
Oldest Hill Divya Desams:
During Dwapara Yugam, there were only two Divya Desams that were on hills. One was Ahobilam and the other was Thiruneermalai.
Lord Narasimha darshan to Arjuna:
It is believed that Lord Narasimha gave darshan to Arjuna after he performed the Ashwamedha Yaagam here at this place.
Prarthana Sthalam:
This is a Prarthana Sthalam and the Lord is said to answer prayers relating to different issues, especially marriage.
Ashta Swayamvektha Kshetrams:
Eight Vishnu temples in India are considered very important as Lord Vishnu manifested himself and these places are praised as Swayam Vyaktha Kshetras of which this Thiruneermalai temple is one.  Others are Srirangam in Trichy District, Srimushnam in Cuddalore District, Tirupathi in Andhra Pradesh and Salagramam, Naimisaranyam, Pushkaram and Narayanapuram in north.
Only Dhivya Desam where Lord Narasimha in Cool Posture:
Only Divya Desams where Lord Narasimha is seen in a cool posture – called ‘Shanta Narasimhar’. Though Lord Narasimha is known for his furious appearance, He is smiling and cool here. After killing Hiranya to save his devout son Prahladha from his tortures, He was still furious.  Boy Prahladha was very much afraid of Lord’s fury. To make his devotee happy, Lord Narasimha shed his fury and appeared before Prahladha as a smiling boy himself. He thus became Bala Narasimha. There is a shrine for him in the hill temple. Behind Bala Narasimha is Ugra (furious) Narasimha with two hands. We can worship Narasimha in two forms Bala and Ugra.
Girivalam:
As this is a hill temple, Giri Valam is observed on Poornima-new moon days.
Boga Ranganatha darshan to sages Markandeya & Brugu:
After the darshan of Lord in Srirangam in reclining posture, sages Markandeya and Brugu were returning to their places.  The darshan at Srirangam was afresh in their minds.  They prayed to Lord to grant them darshan again at this place. Lord granted the darshan as Boga Ranganatha in reclining posture in this place and continues to bless from the hill top His devotees.  Abishek is not offered to Him except a Thaila Kappu – applying cosmetic oil on the idol- once in a year in Karthikai month-November-December.
Etymology:
This Thiruneermalai Kshetram is also called as “Thoyagiri Kshetram” and also as “Thothadri”. Thoya means “Water” and Adhiri means “Mountain” (malai). Since the mountain is surrounded by water, this Sthalam is named as “Thiru Neer Malai” in Tamil. Brahmanda Purana refers this place Thodatri, meaning a mountain surrounded by water.
Devotees bathe in the tank for health and cure from illness and for a clear mind and worship Perumal.  Devotees also seek child boon by placing cradles in a tree and for removal of obstacles in marriage efforts. Devotees perform Tirumanjanam and special pujas to Perumal and offer vastras.

We have seen Gods coming in procession on one vahanam only during festival days. But Ranganatha comes in seven vahans in procession in a single day on the Ratha Sapthami day in Thai month (January-February).  During the sunrise, Lord Ranganatha comes in Surya Prabha vahanam when Arti is shown from foot to face as if Sun God himself performs this puja. Then he comes in procession on Hanumantha, Garuda, Sesha, Horse, Lion and Surya Prabha vahans.

https://www.bharattemples.com/thalamalai-perumal-temple-trichy/,"Thalamalai Perumal Temple, Trichy
Annual festival is celebrated in Tamil month of Puratasi (September / October), once in three years poojas for Idi Bhagavan (Thunder) are performed here. Daily poojas and lighting of numerous lamps on every Saturday are also observed. Celebrations are held during the Tamil months of Chithirai, Avani – (Krishna Jayanthi, Navarathri and Vijayadasami), Margazhi and Thai Pongal and lighting of lamps on Thai Thiruvonam day. During the month of Adi – on the 18th day, during the midday pooja after a dip in the Holy river Cauvery, the Dhandam (the long stick) of Karuppannasami would stand automatically erect and at that time Garuda would go around in the sky. At this instance, the devotees would get excited and shout Lord Govinda name and pray.
Devotees walk around on a narrow path around the temple for pradakshinams. People strongly believe that going around this rock temple would give them successful marriage, wealth and child birth. But this practice is now banned due to accidents.
Thala Malai:
The word ‘Thala’ means head. The region gets the name from a hill called Siragiri located here that seems like the head of a person. The local people believe that it resembles the face of Lord Vishnu.
Ramar Sunai:
In Ramayana, great of the two great epics of Hindu mythology, Lord Rama on his way back to Ayodhya with Sita after rescuing her from Ravana in Lankan lands, he had to stay at this Sthala, a spring by name Ramar Sunai was made and there is water flow always. When a person goes close this spring, he can breathe the pleasurable smell of turmeric.
Head Portion of Sanjeevi Hills:
In Ramayana, the Yuddha Kanda, Indrajit, son of Ravana and the primary of army of demons showered deadly weapons (the Brahmastra.) to kill his enemies – Rama, Lakshmana and Vanaras and they were unconscious. Jambavan sent Hanuman to fetch the Sanjeevi, a powerful life-restoring herb to revive the unconscious. Unable to find the specific herb before nightfall, Hanuman brought the entire mountain Dronagiri which was full of medicinal plants, to the fight field, thus helping find the herb and even with the approach of the Sanjeevi hill, (fragrance of the herbs) Rama and Lakshmana and the Vanaras felt the darts slip off their bodies.
Their wounds healed. Jambavan told Hanuman to replace the Sanjeevi Hill but Hanuman was tired to go back to the spot and he tied the hill in his tail and threw it with full vigor. The top portion of the hill fell and that place came to be known as Thalaimalai. One can find Sanjeevi herb widely spread in this hill and the pilgrims who visit this temple would be guarded against the sting of venomous insects and snakes. There is no threatening to their lives.
Nayakars built this Temple:
It was believed that this temple was built during the period of Nayakars. During those days, there was a shepherd who used to take the cows for grazing. While all other cows came back with him, one cow alone went astray to the top of the hill and giving milk to a boy there. Shepherd was kept searching and found this and informed the Nayakar. That night Lord appeared before Nayakar in his sleep and asked him to build a temple on top and perform regular pooja. From then, the hereditary Nayakars were the treasurers of the temple. At present, the off springs of Thiru Venkatarama Naidu are the treasurers of the temple.
Yama worshipped Lord Vishnu here:
When Yama – the Hindu God of Death was suffering because of Sani Deva’s transition, Yama prayed to Indira Deva who advised him to have a holy dip daily in the Kannimar mountain spring (Sunai) and offer prayers to Lord Nallendra Perumal, he would be relieved of bad karmas. Yama did so and was freed from the ill effects of Sani’s transit. Special poojas would be offered during the Tamil month of Thai.
Pooja for Thunder God:
During Puratasi (Tamil month) celebrations, once in three years poojas for Idi (Thunder) Bhagavan would be performed. During the pooja, one can see cracks on the wall of the building and in few minutes, with God’s grace the cracks would be set right. Even today, this occurre is considered to be a wonder.

Emperor Rajaraja Chola was a staunch Shiva devotee and was conferred the title Shivapada Sekhara. He was instrumental for the prosperity of the kingdom. He was assisted in his efforts by Brahmarayar. He was a Vishnu devotee. To respect him, Rajaraja treated Vaishnava temples with equal respect. Brahmarayar duly reciprocated Rajaraja’s courtesy by his services to Shiva temples. Changes came in later in worship thinking. Other Gods came in beyond Saivite and Vaishnavite faiths. Masathanar belongs to the later generation of Gods. It may be recalled that Sathanar worship was popular during the Sangam period.
The kings will convene the court only after Sathanar worship. This worship was followed during war time also. Thrilled by the power and mercy of Masathanar, kings began to attach this name with theirs as Karuvur Seraman Sathan, Pandian Keeran Sathan, Cholanattu Pidavur Kizhan Mahan Perunchathan, Ollayur Kizhan Mahan Perunchathan and so on. Tamil world knows the great epic poet Seethalai Chathanar, Urayur Mudhukannan Chathanar, Perunthalai Chathanar gaining great powers by worshipping Masathanar. In the days that followed, Sathanar came to be known as Sastha and also as Ayyanar.

All obstacles regarding marriages are removed. Reasonably good job opportunities are assured. Childless devotees are blessed with children.
Vada Srirangam:
Being an Abhimana Sthalam (temple built out of love), there is no big legend behind. Chalukya rulers who visited Srirangam wanted to recreate an idol, within their empire, like the sleeping Ranganatha. They came back here and constructed an idol even bigger than the one in Srirangam. Hence, this temple is also referred to as Vada Srirangam (North Srirangam).
Deva Dhanam:
The village is believed to have been gifted by the Devas and hence the name Deva Dhanam.
Lord in Bhoga Sayanam:
Yet another story goes that tired of measuring the paddy during the harvest season, Lord Ranganatha is believed to have relaxed his head on the same grain measure (One has seen a similar kind of story relating to the Sarangapani temple where Thirumazhisai Azhvaar enquires the sleeping Aravamudhan if he is tired after his long walk and requests the Lord to give him darshan).
Lord appeared in a devotee dream:
Saroja Sadasivam, from a leading business house here, had a vivid dream in 1983. She dreamt of a supine Ranganatha Swamy in a derelict temple, totally neglected, beseeching her for attention. The eighteen and a half feet stone idol, lying on a giant Adhiseshan, was sweating copiously in her dream, telling her that it had had no oil application for very many years, and so could not bear the heat. From the very next day she began the search for this temple, and in the process, visited scores of them.
Two years later, on a chance suggestion, she visited Devadanam, and found the then undeveloped village and temple to be the one in her vision. The deity was all covered in dirt, and the temple completely weed-ridden, and broken down. From then, till now, almost 20 years later, constant effort and a great deal of money has been spent, with the temple finally done its Kumbabhishekam.

Kari Krishna Perumal Temple is a Hindu Temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu located at Thiruayarpadi Village near Ponneri in Thiruvallur District of Tamilnadu. This is a very ancient Krishna temple, a rarity in Tamilnadu as Krishna temples are few compared to Shiva temples.
The temple was built by the Chola king Karikala II, and that is why the deity has the prefix Kari before his name. The present temple with its carved stone pillars must have been built much later than Karikalan’s time. Maybe the temple built by Karikala crumbled in the course of time and was later replaced with the present one by one of his descendants. The temple is well maintained.
The Temple remains open from 07.30 am – 10.30 am and 05.30 pm – 08.30 pm.
The Lord is worshipped here by childless couples to be blessed with a child. It is considered as a Prarthana Sthalam for the childless. On Rohini star every month, if childless couples visit the Kari Krishna temple with two plantains, ½ liter milk, 100gms butter and oil (Gingelly lamp oil) and perform an archanai, the Lord is said to immediately bless the couple with progeny.
Kari Krishna Perumal:
Ages back a cow belonging to a villager used to graze around in the forests here. One day the master of the cow saw the cow pouring its milk in a bush without any one actually milking it. The master who got confused went and saw the place along with the villagers. There was an ant hill amidst the bushes. They started demolishing the ant hill curiously. While digging out they saw this idol of Lord Krishna showing up.
While digging further, it is said that, Lord Krishna moved his leg a bit and stood slanting to avoid being hit by the crowbar. But one of the crowbars hit him on his shoulders. The villagers took out this beautiful idol of Lord Krishna which stood tilted, holding a whip on his hand. It is said that the mark of the crowbar still remains on the deity and sandal paste is applied on it regularly, to heal the wound.
The villagers installed the idol here adjacent to the ant hill itself. The Lord does not have any Peetam or base and seen standing on the floor, in a tilted posture with one of his leg a bit away. Ancient Chozha king, Karikala Chozha II has built this temple for Lord Krishna and hence the God here came to be known as Sri Kari Krishna Perumal.
Hariharan Sandhippu Urchavam:
Bharadhwaja Maha Rishi is said to have undertaken penance at this temple and Agastya Rishi is undertook penance at this place invoking the blessings of Lord Shiva. Pleased with their prayers, Lord Vishnu is said to have appeared before Bharadhwaja Rishi and Lord Shiva before Sage Agastya and acceded to their request of providing joint darshan to the devotees. Marking this occasion, a festival called Hari – Haran Sandhippu Urchavam (‘Shiva – Vishnu Meet’ festival) is celebrated annually near this temple.
This is probably the only place where these 2 Gods meet. In accordance with this event, every year on the 5th day of Chitrai, Kari Krishna Perumal leaves on a procession to the bazaar street in Ponneri where he meets with Lord Shiva and exchanges garland. As Lord Shiva met with Lord Vishnu here, this street has come to be called Hari-Haran bazaar street.
Prarthana Sthalam:
It is also a Prarthana Sthalam where childless couples worship and are blessed with children.
Aayarpaadi:
In Thamizh ‘Aayarpaadi’ means shepherd village, the place where Lord Krishna grew up. This village also has the same name, as the Lord here gives Dharshan as a Shepherd.

This place is worth visiting for its picturesque location and uniqueness in spite of distance and bad roads. Lord Shiva has 5 faces; Isanam, Thatpurusham, Vaamadevam, Sathyojaatham and Agoram. There are 5 ancient Shiva temples on the banks of Kosasthalaiyar (Brahmaranya River) representing the 5 faces of Lord Shiva and this is one of them representing the Agora face of Lord Shiva. The other 4 being Ramagiri Vaaleeswarar (Isanam), Suruttuppalli Pallikondeeswarar (Thatpurusham), Arani (near Periyapalayam) Sampangi Pichaaleeswarar (Vaamadevam) and Ariyathurai Varamoortheeswarar (Sathyojaatham).
As per the legend, there lived a Rishi (Saint) by name Sattai Muni who performed Thapas (penance) in this place on the banks of Brahmaranya River. It is said that he formed this temple and worshipped Lord Shiva here.
It is an ancient temple built by Chola Kings. After the demise of the Chola kingdom this temple had been abandoned and buried under beach sand dunes for many centuries. The temple was discovered by the local people when it’s Kalasam emerged out. The temple has been excavated fully now and rejuvenated to its old glory. According to the inscriptions, the temple is over 1300 years old.
The Temple is located at about 9 Kms from Pulicat, 24 Kms from Kattur, 17 Kms from Thirupalaivanam, 28 Kms from Ponneri, 34 kms from Minjur, 78 Kms from Tiruvallur and 63 Kms from Chennai.
By Road:
Reach Pulicat Village from Ponneri, cross over the new bridge and drive along the lighthouse road to reach Karungali temple. This is desolate area and not advisable to go after 5 pm, in fact it is better to go in the morning. Temple is not open always. Metal road is there but in some areas shifting sand could cover the road and you could get struck badly.
Alternatively, to reach Karungali one has to take the road from Minjur towards Pazhaverkadu (Pulicat). After crossing about 10 Kms from Minjur one can reach a village by name ‘Kattur’. Take right turn from Kattur and drive about 5 Kms (bad and sandy road amidst many salt lakes) to reach the banks of the river Arani.
After reaching the river Arani, one has to take a boat to cross the river and the temple is on the other side of Arani river, which is Karungali village. There is only one boat available and sometimes we have to wait for some time for the boat man to arrive. He charges Rs. 10/- for an up and down trip which takes hardly 5 minutes for each way. Alternatively, to reach the temple by road one can also take the Ennore Port Road, which will lead to this temple.

Only one Kaala pooja is undertaken here at this temple (from 9.00 AM -12 Noon). Temple is open in the afternoon on Pradhosha days though.
Chithra Pournami (Full moon day in the Thamizh month of Chithirai) is very popular here in this temple. People from neighboring villages and also from other places throng here in the night of Chithra Pournami, prepare Pongal and offer to the Lord and worship Chinthamaneeswarar here. It is said that the entire place will be filled with people and everyone will be staying overnight on the sands during that night to get their wishes fulfilled. Sri Chinthamaneeswarar is the Kuladeivam (family God) for the fishermen in this village. Also, the people of this village worship the Lord here by preparing Pongal at the temple, like how it is done in Amman temple in villages. It is very rare and unusual to see this type of worship in Shiva temples.
This temple is considered equivalent to Kasi (Varanasi) and Rameshwaram as it lies both on the sea shore and the banks of a holy river. Performing annual rites to the ancestors during Amavasya (No Moon) and Pournami (Full Moon) days here is considered equal to that of performing them in Kasi or Rameswaram. Many people visit here to do the annual rites to their ancestors. It is also believed that the Lord grant their wishes who worship him here and stay overnight during Pournami days.

Thiruevvul:
The legend connected with this temple says, that one Thai Amavasya day a wandering sage named Salihotra reached Thiruvallur where he met a congregation of sages. They were engaged in taking bath in the tank Hrith-Thapa-Nasini and he was also advised to take bath before performing his daily rituals. The bath changed the mind and Sri Salihotra decided to stay at the bank of that Holy tank and start a penance without food or water for one year. The next year on the same Pushya Amavasya day he completed his penance and took a holy dip in the Hrith-Thapa-Nasini tank and observed his morning prayers.
As he was fasting for one year without food and drink, he collected on that day some paddy and prepared prasadam using rice flour. At this juncture Lord Narayana took the form of an old Brahmin and came the way where Salihotra was waiting to offer a share to a guest. He immediately offered the food to the Brahmin who ate up the offering. Salihotra understood that the old Brahmin was very hungry and immediately offered his share also to the guest too. The guest was satisfied and left the place. Another one year of penance continued without any food and drink.
Again, on the day of Pushya Amavasya Salihotra took his holy bath and after his prayers prepared food as he did the previous year. He offered the food to Narayana and was waiting for a guest. This time also Lord Narayana took the form of an old Brahmin and he was welcomed by Salihotra to his hermitage. The old Brahmin expressed that he was feeling extremely hungry and thirsty and needed a place to rest. After taking prasadam the old Brahmin expressed to Salihotra, ‘where is the place for me to lie down?’ (Evvul?) ‘In this hermitage’, (Ivvul), answered Salihotra.
The old man was pleased at this offer and stretched his body in the hermitage putting his head towards south. Immediately the old Brahmin transformed himself into the form of Sri Narayana and Adisesha appeared with his thousand hoods to serve as couch and canopy. On request from Salihotra Maharishi, the Lord promised that he would permanently stay there and that he would bless and relieve everyone who prays to him after taking bath in the tank of his/her diseases and miseries. Hence, he is called Sri Vaidhya Veeraraghava Swamy.

This place has an important legend behind. This is the place where Renuka Devi’s head was cut off by Parasurama at the behest of his father Sage Jamathgini. Padavedu Renugambal is very popular but this is the place the actual incident took place. Lord Siva and Goddess Parvathi Devi incarnated as the great Saint Jamathgini and his wife Renukadevi and lived on this world. Visu, Viswas, Viswarupan, Paranjothi and Parasuraman were their five sons. Parasurama was their last son.
It was a daily duty for Renukadevi to make a pot out of fresh mud and fetch water for Saint Jamadhgani’s Pooja. One day, she saw the reflection of a Kantharva in the water. She stood mesmerized by his beauty for a split of a second. The mud pot dissolved in the river. She tried again and again but in vain. She realized her mistake and told her husband that an animal chased her and so she couldn’t bring water. But the saint who guessed the real happenings, called out for his first four sons and asked them to cut off their mother’s head.
They all refused and saint cursed them and called his last son Parasurama to do the duty. Parasurama asked for two boons from his Father and he obliged. He chased her mother who ran for life and she hid behind a Arundhati girl, who was cutting woods and begged for mercy. Parasurama warned the girl, but she did not oblige. In the heights of anger Parasurama chopped both heads together. In great distress, he took the heads to his father. According to his granted boons. he brought his brother and mother back to life.
But in confusion, he fixed his mother’s head on the Arundhati girl body. Henceforth the deity was named Mariamman and the place was called as Vettuvanam. A farmer who cultivated the land accidentally dropped the spade on the deity. Blood poured out like a river. A divine voice from the sky said, ” I am Ellaiamman” and a temple was constructed in the place. Though the time and year cannot be judged precisely, it said that in 1961, this temple was one among the 2500 temples in Tamil Nadu.
This temple was newly constructed after demolishing the old temple by Sivarasu Venkatraman Family (Katpadi & London) and the work completed in 2008 (Kumbabishekam done on 3rd Dec 2008)
The Temple is located at about 3 Kms from Pallikonda, 2 Kms from Pallikonda Bus Stop, 7 Kms from Melalathur, 12 Kms from Gudiyattam, 27 Kms from Ambur, 45 Kms from Vaniyambadi and 25 Kms from Vellore.

Choleeswarar temple, the tomb shrine of Arinjaya Chola was built over the mortal remains of Arinjaya Chola (AD 956 – 967), who died in a war at Arur near Thakkolam by his grandson Chola Rajaraja I in the year AD 1014. This Temple is located in the opposite direction of Somanadheeswarar temple. This is comparatively a small temple. This east facing Cholesvara Temple aka Arinjigai Isvaram complex is located on the river bank of Ponnai at the out skirts of the village Melpadi and surrounded by the green paddy fields and shady trees.
The temple complex is well maintained and protected within Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) fence. The granite temple structure does not show any complex plan and the temple never enlarged by royal successors. The architectural elements ‘reflect Chola convention.’ This whole granite structure stands within the rectangular compound defined by granite perimeter walls. The Vesara vimana of the main sanctum is small and typically square and includes sanctum (garbhagriha) Ardhamandapam and mukhamandapam.
From upana to stupi, the vimana is built with green tinged granite stone. Shivalingam (3 – 4 feet tall) is present in a 10 sq. ft sanctum sanctorum. There is an Ardhamandapam before the sanctum. The external vimana walls are divided into segments and the segmenting is marked by pilasters.  The plain outer walls of this particular vimana have brahmakanta pilasters (four sided) and plain Karnapathis. Although there is a slight projection of the sala-koshtas, there is almost no depth to house the deities. It appears that the sala-koshta deities might be later additions.
The vimana has the very austere basement (adhishtana) of padabandha type with the components of upa-peeta, upana, jagadi, tri-patta kumuda moulding. There is an arrangement of friezes of bas-relief lion at the kodungai. The external wall surface is divided by pilasters in to well-shaped ornate niches with makara torana. The sculptures in the niches include Dhakshinamoorthi, Vishnu, Brahma and Durga and these could be later additions.
On both sides of the entrance to the main sanctum, there are two tall, robust Dwarapalakas standing facing each other. Both the Dwarapalakas are best examples of Early Chola sculptures, demonstrating the mastery of the Chola sculptors. Makara Toranas are seen over each of the niche images (around the external walls of the sanctum), with Saint Kannappa Nayanar in the toranam over the niche without deity, Bhikshatana accompanied by two Rishi-patnis in the toranam over Dhakshinamoorthi, Krishna in the toranam over Vishnu and the King (Rajaraja I) worshiping Shivalinga (Arinjaya) in the toranam over Brahmma.
There are many inscriptions all over the sanctum wall. The inscriptions are mainly about donations made in the form of ewe to supply ghee to burn the perpetual lamp in the temple till moon and sun endure, Rajaraja’s meikeerthi, the boundaries of the land given for construction of the temple, watering to Iluppai field (from the seeds oil is extracted to burn the lamps). From the inscriptions the place Melpadi belongs to Tunadu, a subdivision of Perumbanapadi in a district of Jayamkonda Chola Mandalam. The ancient name of the Melpadi is mentioned as Rajasrayapuram and the Choleeswarar Temple was called as ArinjigaiIswara or Arinjiswara.
This Temple is located in the opposite direction of Somanadheeswarar temple. The Temple is located at about 750 meters from Melpadi Bus Stop, 7 Kms from Vallimalai, 8 Kms from Ponnai, 12 Kms form Thiruvalam, 22 Kms from Katpadi, 17 Kms from Ranipet, 21 Kms from Arcot, 30 Kms from Vellore and 143 Kms from Chennai.

Mahadevar Temple is a Hindu Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva located at Mahadevamalai Hills in Kankuppam Village in Vellore District of Tamilnadu. This Temple is located to the west of Katpadi. The Temple is said to be 500 years old, the temple was built by a trader of the Pandya kingdom.
Mahananda Siddha:
Mahananda Siddha was born in Dharmapuri district on December 6, 1930. For some time, he was engaged in the pleasant-smelling turmeric trade. At the age of thirty-five, he undertook renovation work in many temples in Tamil Nadu under the inspiration of Lord Shiva and started feeding the poor (Annadhanam) at Lokuvakulam Bharadhwajeeswarar temple of Kalahasthi in Andhra Pradesh. On the midnight of December 25, 2002, Lord Siva appeared before Mahananda and said,
“You are very fortunate in this life; You are a siddha with a boon to live for a thousand years; Go to Mahadeva Mount and live in a cave and worship Me and protect the devotees”.
Lord Shiva disappeared after that. As commanded by the God, Mahananda Siddha reached Mahadeva mount. As Lord Shiva appeared again before Mahananda Siddha he said:
“You should brush your teeth and take bath only on the first day of Chithirai; you should not seek alms from anyone; all the wealth will be heaped here; you should protect all the living creatures in this mountain from disease and suffering; from now on you should not eat food to satisfy your hunger or drink water to quench your thirst”.
After giving this advice Lord Shiva disappeared. One can see the form on the head of Mahadeva Swami is similar to the serpent with five heads on Lord Shiva’s head. Mahananda siddha worships the idol with flowers that spread fragrance and leaves with good smell. He is a siddha who can meditate by lying on the fire. It is true that we cannot live without food. But Mahananda siddha has demonstrated that it is possible to live without taking food. It is a matter of wonder to learn that this great siddha has not taken food or water for many number of years.
Lord Shiva darshan to a Merchant, a Shiva Devotee:
Legend has it that the merchant, an ardent devotee of Siva, prayed for his darshan and was asked to go to Kalahasti on Maha Shivaratri day. The merchant started the journey and reached a place called K.V. Kuppam (Keezh Vazhi Thunai Kuppam) and made enquiries about the route to Kalahasti. He learnt that he was far away from Kalahasti and the day was Maha Shivaratri. An old man approached the crestfallen trader promising to show him the Lord. The two reached a hill and the old man turned out to be Siva, who ordained the devotee to build a temple there. The village from where the trader was met by came to be called Keezh Vazhi Thunai Kuppam.

Kangeyan:
According to legend, Devas prayed to Lord Shiva to protect them from the atrocities of the demons. Lord Shiva created six sparks from his forehead eye. Vayu and Agni took them and left in Holy River Ganga. Six children came from the sparks then and were taken care of by Karthika maidens.

Muruga devotee Malayadasar, father of Sri Kirupananadavariar, popular spiritual leader of Muruga cult during our times, approached one Lokanathar known as Tirupugazhswami in Tiruvannamalai seeking his help to construct a tower to this temple. Malayadasar was asked to come next year for the purpose. When he went again, the Swami gave Malayadasar one rupee with Vibhuti Prasad and advised him to start the work. Work progressed with the grace of God and the Tower construction was completed successfully.
Curd Rice Nivedhana:
When saint Arunagiriar came to this place, after completing his pujas, offered curd rice as Nivedhana to Lord. Six Muruga devotees came there at that time to whom the Nivedhana was given.

Nootreteeswarar Temple is a Hindu Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva located at Chinnakavanam Village near Ponneri in Thiruvallur District of Tamilnadu. This is a very ancient temple with an interesting story and sthalavruksham which adds antiquity to this temple. The temple itself is very small and neat but the legends and the Angola tree (Eru Azhinjal in Tamil) add to the sanctity of the temple. This is the birth place of Ramalinga Adigalar’s mother.
Two Presiding Deities:
In olden days this place was called Chathurvethapuram and the main deity is called Chadurvedeeswarar with Goddess Sivagami Ammai. On his way to Kasi, Sage Agasthya came here to worship Chadurvedeeswarar when he got the divine message that worshipping a Shivalingam under the Eranzhil tree here for 108 days will be equivalent to going to Kasi. So, he created a lingam every day with the sand of the nearby Brahma Aranya river and worshipped them for 108 days.
But on the final day, all the 108 lingams merged themselves into a single Vinayaka idol for the simple reason that he did not start the worship with Vinayaka as per custom. Then Lord Shiva gave Dharshan to Agasthya in the form of Vinayaka. The 108 lingams which got merged into a Vinayaka are present under the Eranjil tree in the name of Ankola Ganapathy. In spite of many hundreds of years of exposure to nature’s elements the sand made Vinayakar is still looking fine.
Since all his 108 lingams got merged into a Vinayaka, Agasthya then installed another lingam called Nootreteeswarar which is considered equivalent to the original 108 lingams. In the sanctum sanctorum we can see both Nootreteeswarar and Chadurvedeeswarar in the form of lingams in separate shrines. Also, there are two Nandhis for the two lingams.
Sage Agastya built 108 temples on the banks of Kuchasthalai River: 
As per another legend, the sage Agastya emptied the oceans to reveal the demons lead by Vritrasura. It enabled the Devas to find and kill them. However, a lot of living beings in the ocean lost their lives without water. Due to this sin, the sage got severe stomach pain. He approached Lord Subramanya in the site called Thiruthani. He advised the sage to construct 108 temples for Lord Shiva to get rid of his pain. He created a river called Kuchasthalai river and built 108 temples on the banks of that river. It is said that Nootreteeswarar temple in Chinnakavanam is the 108th temple.
The Temple remains open from 9.00 AM to 12.00 Noon and 4.00 PM to 7.00 PM. The priest lives nearby and he will open temple at any time on request.
Chithirai Brahmmotsavam in April-May, Mahasivarathri in February-March, and Margazhi Tiruvadhirai in December-January are the major festivals celebrated in this temple.
The Angola Ganapathy grants the wishes for his devotees. After the wish is fulfilled, it is a custom here to offer Vada malai (54 to 108) to him. Normally Vada malai will be offered only to Anjaneyar and possibly this is the only place where Vada malai is being offered to Vinayaka. People, who want to get married, worship the Goddess on a full moon day with a rose garland for continuous 3 full moon days to get their wishes sanctioned.

This place was once a forest filled with trees and shrubs with sweet-smelling flowers and was known as Suganda Vanam (Suganda-indicating sweet smelling, Vanam-forest).

Nava Kannikas the nine virgins are around the car-Rath.
 
Mother Kamakshi penance on Lord Shiva:
Once Parvathi Devi closed the eyes of Shiva for fun which resulted in total darkness of the whole universe. Shiva was displeased by her act and she had to come down to earth and do penance to join Shiva once again. Here She penanced standing on tip of her left leg on fire and so she is known as Tapas Kamakshi. At the same time, Shukra was also doing penance to get back his eye sight when he intervened to stop Mahabali from the offering of three feet of land to Lord Vamana, the dwarf. He blocked the Jal Patra the water bowl.
Lord Vamana used a Darba grass to remove the block and thus made Venus blind in one eye. To get back his eyes, Shukra-Venus also performed penance on Lord Shiva in this place when Kamakshi also was on a penance. Lord Shiva appeared before Shukra the devotee first and granted his eye back. Priority was given to his devotee first. Then, Lord Shiva asked Kamakshi to end her penance and go to Kancheepuram (Kamakshi came to Kanchi, made a Shiva Linga of mud and started her pooja once again. She was then married to Shiva at Kanchipuram where she is known as Kalyana Kamakshi).
While going in an anxiety, she did not put down the Yagna fire and so all the living beings around were suffering due to the heat generated. When Aadhi Shankara was passing through, he installed a Srichakra called Artha Meru made of 8 herbs and reduced the heat. Still people feared with the Kamakshi idol in penance and so the later Sankaracharya’s shifted this idol to the side of the temple and installed another Kamakshi in Santha Roopam, called Aadhi Kamakshi, with Sugarcane stick in one hand and Parrot in the other.
Mangadu:
The term Mangadu means “Mango Forests or Mango Grooves” and as the term implies this must have been a thickly wooded Mango groove in times of yore.
Mother fondness for Milk:
There is an interesting story about her fondness for milk. When Kamakshi was in deep penance in Mangadu with no one around only the cows were her food givers. The cowherds used to graze the cattle near the place where Kamakshi was meditating. The divine intervention is discernible at this juncture. At least one cow used to feed her milk every day. For many years this was her staple food. Thus, she grew fond of milk and it is offered to appease her.

The history of Velleeswarar is but part of the history of Mangadu Kamakshi temple. Mother Parvathi had to land on Earth due to the curse of Lord Shiva as she covered his eyes in playful mood resulting in a standstill of the activities of the world. She came to this place, stood on one leg amidst five types of fire, seeking the grace of Lord to take her back. It was at the same time, planet Venus-Shukra too performed penance on Lord Shiva in this place to have his eye back which he lost for blocking the charity offered by Mahabali – 3 feet land – to Lord Vishnu.
Lord Vishnu then covered all the worlds in 2 feet and the for the third, Mahabali offered his own head to honour his promise to Lord. When Lord Shiva came to grace Mother Parvathi, He granted his first blessing to Shukra the devotee, establishing the rule that priority goes for devotees than for his own consort. As Shukra was then performing Shiva Puja, Lord could not leave the place to bless Mother Kamakshi. He advised her by a voice to go to Kancheepuram to continue the penance. Ambica followed Lord’s advice, continued penance at Kanchi and joined her Lord.
Lord granting darshan and eye to Shukra-Velli, stayed in the place as per Shukra wish. As Sukra worshipped Lord Shiva here, the Lord came to be known as Sri Velleeswarar and also as Sri Bargaveeswarar. This temple is Sukra Sthalam among the Navagraha Temples of Chennai (or Thondai Mandalam). Sri Sukra blesses people with wealth, prosperity, good family, vehicles, fame and social status.

Kovur:
According to legend, Goddess Kamakshi was performing Thapas on Panchagni (fire) in Mangadu praying Lord Shiva to marry her. Her penance was so intense that the whole surroundings became too hot and all living beings suffered because of enormous heat. But Lord Shiva was meditating deeply with his eyes closed. Sages and Devas worshipped Lord Vishnu to save the world from the heat of the penance. Lord Vishnu directed Mahalakshmi to save the world.
Goddess Sri Mahalakshmi came down here to this place in the form of a cow and worshipped Lord Shiva to make him open the eyes, so that the world is saved. Pleased with her prayers, Lord Shiva opened his eyes, after which the heat of the place subsided and became cooler. As Mahalakshmi worshipped here in the form of a cow, the place came to be known as Kopuri (In Thamizh, Ko means cow) and later corrupted to become Kovur. At later stages Kulothunga Chozha had built this temple beautifully.
Saint Thyagaraja composition on Lord Shiva:
Saint Thyagaraja has visited this temple on his way to Thirupathi. It is said that Saint Thyagaraja traveled on a palanquin towards Thirupathi and passed through this place. He also visited this temple on his way. A local headman called Sundharesan asked the saint to compose and sing some songs on him. Thyagarajar refused and said that he won’t sing praise of any individual and he will sing praise of God only and left Kovur.
While going from Kovur, his palanquin was obstructed by a group of bandits who threw stones on the palanquin and his servants to stop him from going further. The saint Thyagaraja stopped and got down from the palanquin to explain the bandits that he was not so rich to be robbed and also, he was on a pilgrimage to Thirupathi. The bandits came near Thyagaraja and asked him who threw the stones back at them.
Thyagaraja told them that there were no other people with them except the carriers of palanquin. But the thieves told that they saw 2 youngsters furiously throwing back the stones on them to save Thyagaraja. Saint Thyagaraja realized that they were none other than Sri Rama and Sri Lakshmana who came to his rescue.
Saint also realized that there is some holy power to this place and again came back to Kovur temple and sung 5 compositions (Keerthanas) called ‘Kovur Pancharathnam’. The local headman was too proud thinking that Saint Thyagaraja sung in praise of him only. But the saint explained him that the 5 compositions were made in praise of the Lord Sundareswarar and not the individual called Sundareswaran.
The Kovur Pancharatnams are “Ee Vasudha” (Sahaana Raagam), “Kori Sevimpa” (Karaharapriya Raagam), “Sambo Mahadeva” (Pantuvarali Raagam), “Nammi Vachina” (Kalyani Raagam) and “Sundareswaruni” (Sankarabharanam Raagam). Most of the compositions of Saint Thyagaraja are in praise of Lord Rama only. This is one of the few places where he had composed Keerthanas on other Gods.

Guru Sthalam:
This ancient temple is connected to the Ramayana period. According to the history, Lord Rama on his way to Sri Lanka rested here in this place which was then a forest. While resting under an Amla tree (‘Nelli’ in Thamizh), He realized that there was a Shiva Lingam under the ground and his feet had touched the head of the Lingam unknowingly. Lord Rama acquired a Dhosham as he had touched the Lingam with his feet.
So, he undertook a penance towards Lord Shiva for 48 days with just one Amla fruit as his food, to recover from the Dhosham and to bring out the Shiva Lingam. Lord Shiva pleased with Rama’s penance came out from the earth and gave Vishwaroopam Dharshan to Rama. Rama overwhelmed by the Lord’s mercy named the Shiva Lingam as Ramanatheswarar and worshipped him. Goddess Parvathi too appeared and gave Dharshan to Rama as Sivakama Sundari.
Lord Rama with sincere prayers worshipped Lord Shiva as his Guru and got to know the directions to reach the place where Mother Sita was kept under custody of Ravana and headed towards Sri Lanka. As Sri Rama worshipped Lord Shiva as his Guru, this place became a Guru Sthalam among 9 Navagraha Temples of Chennai (or Thondai Mandalam). Here Lord Shiva Himself is worshipped as Guru Bhagavan.
Uthara Rameswaram:
This place is also called Uthara Rameswaram, as Sri Rama worshipped Lord Shiva here, similar to Rameswaram. Also, according to temple sources, it is said that Porur was called as Uthara Rameswaram in ancient days. It is also said that; this temple is equivalent to Rameswaram and those who are not able to go pilgrimage to Rameswaram can visit this place and be blessed by the Lord.
Porur:
The place Porur is called so due to the reason that Lord Rama when coming in search of Sita came to know the place where Sita is and went to wage war with Ravana. (Porukku ponathal Porur).
Offering of Sadari and Theertham:
The speciality of this temple is the offering of Sadari and Theertham to devotees. This is usually done only in Vishnu temples. This practice is followed here to honour Rama’s devotion to Lord Shiva.

This region was once ruled by Cholas. The original name of this place is Pugazh Chola Nallur which has been corrupted to Pozhichalur. This temple was built in the 12th Century AD.
Vada Thirunallaru:
Lord Shani (Saturn)has different phases like Kanda Sani, Janma Sani, Ezharai Sani. Sri Sani Bhagavan is said to have been relieved of his sins by performing penance to Lord Shiva. As directed by Lord Shiva he visited this village and created a holy pond called “Nallar Sani Theertham” and worshipped Lord Shiva and was cleansed of his sins. Hence, Sri Sani Bhagavan here is believed to be Mangala Saneeswarar with no Doshams or ill effects. Hence, he is seen in this temple as the prime God (only next to Thirunallar).
In the north Tamil Nadu this is the only temple dedicated to Lord Sani where devotees throng in large numbers to get relief from the impact of Sani. In this temple, when offerings of food are made, crows (that are believed to be the vehicle of Lord Shani) come in large numbers to eat the food offered. During this time, devotees gather in large numbers and feed the crows to get themselves relieved of their sins. Due to this reputation, this place is called as Vada Thirunallaru.
Agastheeshwarar:
As per the legend, as all the celestial beings went to Himalayas to attend the divine marriage of Lord Shiva and Parvati, the earth lost its balance. To balance the earth, Shiva asked the sage Agastya to travel towards the southern direction. Due to greatness of this sage, he was equivalent to all the celestial beings and as soon as he moved to the southern direction, the earth was balanced back. Agastya did not want to miss the wedding. With the help of Lord Shiva, he got the divine sight and watched the divine marriage in many sites in South India. Pozhichalur is one such site where he got the darshan of divine marriage. Shiva Linga was also installed by him and hence it is called as Agastheeshwarar.
Origin of Shivalingam:
It is said that the Shivalingam was unearthed when the Mudaliars who owned these lands were ploughing their fields.
Naadi Parihara Sthalam:
This temple is mentioned in Nadi Jodhidam for Pariharams and hence it is popularly known as Naadi Parihara Sthalam.

The temple remains open from 7.30 AM to 11.00 AM and 4.30 PM to 7.00 PM.
During the annual Brahmotsavam in the Tamil month of Maasi, (Feb-Mar) a special pooja happens here. The Sakthi Vel (spear) of Lord Muruga is worshipped by the devotees in this pooja, and they find that they are relieved from chronic problems in their life.
Those who are desirous of being rid of diseases or a representative from the family, vows to light lamps with ghee and lotus wicks for forty-eight days. If this is followed sincerely and with true devotion, the person’s health improves within the time period. In case of those unable to come to the temple daily, the priest offers to light the lamps on their behalf. Once they are better, the devotees or their representatives come to the temple and perform 108 circumambulations or Anga Pradakshinams (rolling around the temple) to offer thanks.
Brahma Sastha:
Lord Brahma had once become arrogant, that he was indeed the creator of the entire universe, and without him, the world would come to an end. Lord Muruga wanted to humble him and asked him the meaning of Pranava Mantra. Lord Brahma did not know the meaning. Lord Muruga imprisoned him in order to punish him and took over the role of creation. He also acquired the symbols of Lord Brahma, namely, the Akshara Mala and the Kamandalu. This form of Lord Muruga is referred to as Brahma Sastha.
Place for Salvation:
The temple is found on the banks of the river Kusasthalai and is mentioned in Matsya Puranam, Koorma Puranam, Bhavishya Puranam, Linga Puranam and Markandeya Puranam. The Kusasthalai river is referred to as Dakshina Sivaganga Theertham and as Uttara Vahini as it flows from South to North. Any river flowing from South to North is said to be holier and benefit those who meditate on its banks seeking liberation or mukthi.
Pathiri Ayya:
Lord Murugan of this Temple is also called as Padhiri Ayya or Padhiriyar. There is an interesting legend behind the name Padhiri Ayya or Padhiriyar. During the British Period, there was a collector who was travelling along the river. As he rested under the shade of the trees, he found the idol of Lord Muruga in the then, single shrine granite structure. In the form of Brahma Sastha, holding Akshara Mala and Kamandalam, he seemed from a distance, like a priest holding a Rosary to the British officer. So, he wanted to take a closer look at the Padhiri. (word for Priest) Those with him thought it was not a good idea, as he may not be allowed access into a Hindu temple.
However, it is believed, that Lord Muruga, came in the form of a priest and took him into the temple that night. The Collector was overwhelmed. From then on, the Lord has come to be known as Pathiri Ayya. Till date, during the Aadi Kiruthigai festival, a number of Christians join the Hindus in breaking coconuts thanking the “Pathiri” for fulfilling their prayers. The temple is an excellent example of communal harmony where people of both religions come together and offer their gratitude side by side.
People worshipped Lord Muruga here:
Lord Muruga at this temple has also been worshipped by Sage Agasthya, Lord Brahma, Chitragupta, Narada, and the nine planets as per the Puranas.

A married merchant while travelling in Kasi city, marries another beautiful girl, loving her at first sight. He along with his new wife and her brother come back to his village near Pazhayanur. On reaching his village, the merchant remembers his earlier wife and fears for showing his new love to her. Without hesitation, he takes his brother in law to a nearby pond and drowns him. When his new wife enquires about her brother, the merchant takes her to the pond acting as if they are out for search, unabashedly kills the new wed wife too in the same pond.
The dead woman comes out as a wandering spirit (Neeli in Tamil), and carrying the brother ghost as her kid, follows the merchant. The merchant nearing his village, crosses Pazhayanur. Night falls and the merchant had to take rest. The Velalars (today’s merchant community) of Pazhayanur are known for their wisdom and integrity. They welcome the guest of their village, feed him and request him to take rest there and go to his native the next day. The “Neeli”, the ghost appears in the disguise of his true wife along with the kid and requests before the Village heads that the merchant had ignored her and is running away from her.
She pleads with them to unite them. The merchant knows very well that there is no chance of his wife appearing at that spot, fearing the worst, refuses to have the woman with him. The guests are intrigued and ask the merchant to have his wife and kid with him that night, in the same room, as it was already late night. Neeli, the ghost is smart and asks the village headmen to make her husband remove the sacred knife he carries along to thwart evils, saying that it is disgusting that a man does not even believe his own wife and carries a sword.
She also adds that she fears for her life and that of her kid, that this man may kill them when they are fast asleep. Seeing her sob and narrate a pathetic story, the village head men believe her and order the merchant to have her in his room. The village head men 70 of them, the Velalars back the Neeli for staying with the merchant. With no other choice, the merchant agrees, but asks guarantee for his life.
The village heads (63 of them) promise that if something untoward happens to the merchant, they will also perish themselves, jumping into the fire, before the Shivalinga of Pazhayanur. And as expected, the worse happens. The Neeli kills the merchant, throws away the ghost kid on her way back to hell besides, crushes the kid ghost beneath her feet and disappears. The village headmen, on seeing the gory death of their guest, feel they are responsible for his death, plunge into the big fire before the Shivalinga.
One head man who is left out, is again called by the Neeli, (taking the form of the wife of the headman himself), asking him why he is alone here, while the others have jumped to death, to keep up their promise. The headman, was ploughing the field by then. Hearing that his brethren have perished, slays his head off with the plough edge and suicides himself to keep up the promise.

Oordhva Thandavam:
The legend is that two demons – Sumban and Nisumban had worshiped Lord Shiva to seek his blessings. Impressed by their rigorous penance, Lord Shiva gave them a blessing that every drop of their blood that fell on the ground would turn into a lingam. Having sought Lord Shiva’s blessings, these two demons started terrorizing the celestial gods who in turn complained to Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva asked Goddess Parvathi to create “Bathra Kali” and this Kali was advised to go to Thiruvalangadu to destroy the demons.
Mother Parvathi created a furious Kali and destroyed the demons. Kali consumed the blood of the demons and their army and grew more furious. However, since she had drunk the blood of the demons, she started losing control of her senses and started acting like a demon herself. She started terrorizing the celestial gods, who one again sought Lord Shiva’s intervention in this matter. To solve this problem, Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvathy came to this place.
Kali who was not in control of her senses, started fighting with Lord Shiva. Lord Brahma, Lord Mahavishnu and Rishi Naradhar intervened and made them accept a dance competition instead of a fight, which the duo agreed to perform. It is believed that the dance performance was witnessed by Goddess Parvathy, Rishi Naradhar, Sage Munjikesa (Sage Anantha) and serpent Karkodaka.  Lord Brahma and Lord Mahavishnu are believed to have provided music for their dance.
Lord Shiva performed 17 types of dances which Kali also repeated. Finally, Lord Shiva played his “Oordhva Thandavam” – a dance with very fast movements. Lord Shiva intentionally dropped his right earring on the ground, stood on his right leg, picked up the earring with the toe of his left leg and wore it again during the dance itself. Kali could not repeat this movement and admitted her defeat.
Goddess Parvathy, who was astonished to watch this performance is praised here as “Arukilirunthu Viyantha Nayaki” (goddess who witnessed the spectacular dance performance). The lord here is praised as “Andamura Nimirntharuliya Nayanar” as he performed the Oordhva Thandavam. Kali was very angry to accept her defeat.
To appease her anger, Lord Shiva told her that he would be performing a pleasing dance – “Raksha dance” at Thiruvirkolam temple and she could have his dharisanam there. Lord Shiva said that he alone was equal to her and said further that those coming to worship him here, should worship her first to reap the full benefit of the worship. Since then, Kali has her own temple to grace the devotees.
Pancha Sabha:
Legend has it that when the Lord was once entranced in a deep cosmic dance, the jewels from the Lord’s anklets fell onto the earth and scattered in 5 places, Thiruvalangadu being one of them.
Vadaranyeswarar:
According to the legend, in ancient times this region was a forest densely covered with banyan trees (Aalamaram in Tamil). It is believed that a Swayambu Lingam was discovered under a banyan tree. Later a temple was constructed and the lord was named as “Vadaranyeswarar” (Vadam meaning banyan tree, Aranyam meaning forest and the Easwar represents Lord Shiva).
Devarsingaperuman:
Celestial gods (Devas) are also believed to have worshiped the lord of this temple, he is also praised as “Sri Devarsingaperuman”.
Karaikal Ammaiyar:
Lord Shiva’s dance here was also witnessed by one of his great devotees, Saint Karaikal Ammaiyar. She is also one of the 63 Nayanmars. It is said that she went to Mount Kailash by walking upside down on her head to see Lord Shiva. The lord addressed her as “Mother” (Amma in Tamil) and advised her to go to Thiruvalangadu to see his dance. She came to see the lord in this temple but a Shiva lingam started appearing wherever she put her foot. To give respect, she decided to again walk upside down on her head. She witnessed the dance performance of Lord Shiva, rendered her pathigam (hymn) and attained salvation in this temple itself. It is believed that her last resting place was at the feet of Lord Natarajar. Since her pathigams are prior to the Moovars Devaram, they are called “Mootha Thiru Pathigam”.
Thiru Gnanasambandhar:
Another legend associated with this place is that since Karaikal Ammaiyar had walked on her head at this place, Saint Thiru Gnanasambandhar was afraid to set his foot on the soil. Not wanting to show any disrespect towards Karaikal Ammaiyar, he decided to stay in a nearby village and spent the night there without visiting this temple. However, Lord Shiva of this temple appeared in his dream and asked if he had forgotten to praise him. Next morning, he visited this temple and rendered a pathigam in which he mentioned about the “Neeli story” and God’s reminder to praise him.
Neeli Story:
Another legend associated with this place is that of a lady called “Neeli”. It is believed that she was killed by her husband as he had suspected her of infidelity. After her death, she could not move on to her next birth and started roaming around this place in the form of a ghost. Incidentally, in his next birth, her husband was travelling through this place. Seeing her former husband, Neeli decided to seek revenge. She assumed the form of his present wife and wanted to go with him. He was surprised to see his wife here, he sensed that something was wrong and he refused to let her accompany him.
Neeli went to the locals (velalars) and complained that her husband was abandoning her. The locals interfered and asked him to stay with her at a nearby place and travel with her the next morning. He tried explaining to them that she might not be his wife but they refused to his pleas. Instead they vouched for his safety by saying that if anything were to happen to him, they would also give up their lives.
As soon as they went inside the house that the locals had given to them, Neeli took her original form of a ghost and killed him. In the morning when the locals found him dead, they decided to end of their lives and keep the promise that they made to him. The legend is that 70 velalars gave up their lives by self-immolation (Theekuliyal in Tamil). It is also believed that Lord Shiva gave salvation to all of them.
It is interesting to note that the old Tamil proverb “Neeli Kanneer” (crocodile tears) originated from this story only. The hall where these velalars gave up their lives can still be seen near the Saatchi Boodeshwarar temple in Pazhayanur (at about one 1 Km from Thiruvalangadu temple). It is said that the heirs of those velalars still go to Thiruvalangadu temple for worship and for offering their services.
Mantheeswarar:
Another legend is that Sani Bhagwan (Saturn) advised his son, Mantheeswarar who had accrued a sin (Dosham) when a lizard fell on him, to go to Thiruvalangadu and worship Lord Shiva there. Pleased with his penance, Lord Shiva appeared before him and blessed him by absolving the sin.
Bharata Muni prayed Lord Shiva for progeny:
The most ancient legend has it that, Bharata Muni and his spouse Subhadra prayed in this Thiruvalangadu village for progeny, after taking bath in the Puthrakameshwarar Theertham.
People worshipped Lord Shiva here:
It is believed that Lord Murugan, Goddess Lakshmi, Karkotaka, Sage Sunanda and Saint Tirumular have worshiped Lord Shiva in this temple.

Marudandhan was the son of the sage Suholar. The sage drove away his consort (mother of Marudandhan) on charges of adultery, and thereafter she led an immoral life. As Marudandhan grew, he became a friend of the prince of the country. The prince was a lustful and salacious youth. Marudandhan too got influenced by him and became lustful. Once, womanizing, both went to an elderly woman and made merry together. Then she realized that the adult who accompanied the prince was her son. Knowing this, Marudandhan, began to lament loudly at the sin he had had committed. Pricked by this ill feeling, he discarded the material life and went to the forest and began to meditate.
Pleased by his sincere and strong penance, Lord Shiva appeared before him. He pardoned the sin, as it was done unknowingly. However, Lord Shiva said. “Any man should see a woman as a mother only”. To make the world realize this I enacted this horrible drama. In the ‘Kali Yuga’ many such incidents may happen. The guilty should realize the sin and repent. Still, being wreck with this conscience thrashing him, Marudandhan asked, for atonement. Lord Shiva asked him to construct a temple and pray towards him every day will give him a peace at mind.

Though he had done Girivalam so many times before, he never saw that tree before. Thookkanakuruvi Koodu is considered as a good Vasthu symbol and due to the 1008 of them here, this place is considered as a highly powerful Vasthu power Sthalam. From the language of so many birds, he understood that the flower is going to bloom on the next Maha Shivarathri day and so waited in penance at the foot hill. On that eventful Maha Shivarathri day, the Argyadevavalli flower finally bloomed and all the thousands of birds flew in abundant happiness chanting ‘Om Namasivaya’.
Brighu maharishi was slightly upset that he could not see the flower but the birds have already seen it. Agasthiar appeared again with his wife and took Brighu maharishi for the first time to the hilltop (all the time, he was at the foot hill only) and disappeared there. Brighu maharishi finally got the glimpse of the flower as a reflection in the ‘Kodi Pushpa Aadhi Mahamaha Theertham (Sunai)’ and then raised his head and got the direct darshan of the flower.
This temple has only one Kala Puja. The Temple is open from 10.00 AM to 12.00 Noon.
Thiruthuthal means ‘correcting the wrongs’ in Tamil and this temple blesses the salvation stage for everyone after correcting all their sins.

Chettiappar was a tantric from Kerala who never used his powers against any one. Trading, especially in turmeric was his main profession. He once came to Manakkal. He saw the Saptha Madhas bathing in a tank before him. They were Brahmi, Maheswari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, Rudrani, Gaumari and Chamundi. He offered them his turmeric stock which they did not need. Chettiappar was not sad that he could not sell his stock but was sad that it was not needed by such divine angels. He wanted to sell his turmeric even by threatening them. He began to take the ornaments they have left on the steps of the tank.
Goumari noticed it and called him. She offered to buy his turmeric. The trader asked for how much value, one coin or two coins. Goumari picked up a flower from her hair and asked him to give an equal weight. His turmeric could not stand before the weight of the flower. He placed all his stock – many bags – the flower side did not raise at all. He realized that the seven virgins were not simply ordinary humans but divines. He fell at their feet and sought their pardon. He built a temple there for the Saptha Madhas.

The Chozhas used to maintain armies in several places in their country to protect their kingdom. One such group was called Ambalakarar and who were stationed in Vellalur Nadu near Sivagangai and their job was to protect the kingdom from the sea robbers. The chiefs of these castes were eleven in number and they were called “Karaikararkal”, The Ezhai Katha Amman (Goddess who protected the poor) belonged to this caste.
In Vellalur about 900 years ago lived two sisters. The elder one though married did not have any children. The younger sister had about 8 children. The elder sister loved these children, and fondled all of them. The younger sister became jealous because of that. Other people told her that all her children will desert her and go with her elder sister. One day, when the elder sister came in search of the kids, the younger sister locked all her kids in the Chicken cage and told her sister that they were not there.
The elder sister who happened to see the children in the cage, then said, “If they are not there, then they would not be there.” After she went back the younger sister found that all her kids had turned in to stone. When her neighbours saw this, they advised the younger sister to go and approach the elder sister. The kind hearted elder sister then brought back to life all the kids. This elder sister was well known for helping poor people. After her death, her clan members started worshipping her as Goddess
On Tuesdays and Fridays temple would be open from 9 am to 2 Pm.

There are Vinayaka shrines in Northeast and Northwest.

From the third century BCE, Pulicat was under the early Cholas, Pandyas, Sangam Cheras, Pallavas and then under the medieval Cholas. Geographer Ptolemy’s records of ancient ports include mentions of Podouke (now Pulicat). When it came under the Vijayanagar Kingdom between the 14th and 17th Centuries, Pulicat was called Anandarayan Pattinam, and Krishnadevaraya changed it to Pazhaverkadu. It was during this time that the Adi Narayana Perumal Temple was built.
Pazhaverkadu was also known as Pralaya Kaveri and Mallapatnam as per the 16th century Telugu stone inscription found above the entrance of the Goddess shrine. This temple has been built by a Telugu man called Balavandakulu. By all accounts, the temple was popular with the villagers and till 1988 a priest used to come from Ponneri and Laksharchanas, Navaratri puja and other pujas were conducted regularly. The last samprokshanam was in 1979.
The original temple was a magnificent structure, typical of the great temples of south India. The entrance is striking and even though the gopuram is missing, the main entrance with the walls on either side looks like an entrance of a fort. The Temple has been built by Balavandakulu, a Telugu, as per the Telugu inscription found at the Thayar shrine in the complex.
The most striking feature and may be the first of its kind seen in Tamilnadu is that the whole temple is built using Laterite only. The roofs are made up of stone. The Vimanam are mixture of limestone and bricks. There is a small mandapam with Garuda facing the main shrine at the entrance; inside are exquisite Murtis of Rama, Lakshmana and Sita. The Rama image is broken, with the bow and arrow missing.
There was once a separate sannidhi for Rama to the right of the main sannidhi, which has now collapsed. The mandapam leading to the temple has beautiful carvings of dancers and the Dasavathara. On one pillar has a relief of a monkey eating a jackfruit; above is a panel of four monkeys juxtaposed to look like a single monkey. There are rich carvings of mermaids, man-beasts, man with several heads.
Presiding Deity is called as Adi Narayana Perumal. He is flanked by Sridevi and Bhudevi. The utsavars had been removed to a newly built Varadaraja temple for safety. The Lord in this temple is seen in standing posture, with Sankhu and chakra in his upper hands. His lower right hand is Abhaya hasta and the lower left-hand rests on his thigh.
Outside the sannidhi is a small but beautiful idol, whose lower right hand is Varada hasta and whose lower left-hand rests on the thigh. He too is flanked by Sridevi and Bhoodevi. The Thayar and Andal Shrines are separate on either side of the main mandapam. The bali peetam is a beautifully carved structure, with steps leading to the top of the bali peetam from all four sides.
The Temple is called as mini-Angkor Vat, because it has intricately carved Ramayana scenes on its roof cross-beams, close to the ceilings, the figures not taller than 8 inches. The miniature engravings that run across the supporting beams in the ardha mandapa, depicting in detail, the story of Ramayana. This is still intact. Apart from this, the smaller mandapa before the main shrine and two small shrines on the side still remain in their original form, though dilapidated. The temple staircase had intricate carvings, which are no longer noticeable.
The temple is rich in heritage and artistic value, but lacks care and maintenance. It has only two acres of land in Thaangalperumpalam, a village that is a few miles away but its produce is insufficient for the maintenance of the temple. There is a Subramanya Swamy temple which is some 150 years old built by some Chettiars in nearby area, and also a 10th century Chola period temple is located in the nearby Koviladi island.
The Church is located at about 550 meters from Pazhaverkadu Bus Stop, 1 Km from Pulicat Bus Stand, 9 Kms from Thirupalaivanam, 10 Kms from Karungali, 20 Kms from Ponneri, 20 Kms from Ponneri Railway Station, 74 Kms from Thiruvallur, 70 Kms from Chennai Airport and 55 Kms from Chennai.

Lord Shiva and Parvathi were walking from Melmalayanur towards Ramapuram (the place where this temple is located, which subsequently came to be known as Putlur because of the Goddess manifesting herself in the form of a Putru – an anthill). This place was a forest those days full of neem trees. Parvathi tired after the long walk, sat down and asked Lord Shiva to fetch her some water. Lord Shiva went searching for water but could not find any nearby. He had to go to the river Coovum to bring the water. It started raining heavily and the river was getting flooded.
So, he had to wait a while for the rain to subside. Tired of waiting for the Lord, and exhausted with hunger and thirst, the Goddess lay down on the floor and an anthill grew over her. She became one and the same with the anthill. Lord Shiva returned shortly after and found that Parvathi had permanently stayed there. So, he too stood beside her and is called Thandavarayan. Probably this is the only Amman temple where you can find a Nandi before the sanctum sanctorum and this is because of the presence of Shiva behind the goddess.
One Ponmeni pledged his land to a money lender named Makisuran. He worked in the same land to maintain his family. Unscrupulous Makisuran tortured all the people this way by lending them money and swelled their liabilities with abnormal compound interest rates. He thus swallowed the lands of all. He severely beat Ponmeni due to default in payments and demanded Ponmeni in the presence of villagers to plough the Poongavanam outside the place in a single night on Shivarathri day before sunrise and threatened to do with his life if he failed to do so.
Poongavanam is the place of evil spirits. Ponmeni thought it better to fail and die in a day than dying each day. He began tilling the land praying to Mother Karumayee. He saw an old man and an aged woman under a tree. The woman was very thirsty. Ponmeni helped the old man to fetch water. When they returned, they found the woman disappearing. When Ponmeni turned to the old man, he also was not there. When Ponmeni resumed his tilling, he found the plough stuck and the spot began to bleed.
A voice assured him of safety and said “I am Angala Parameswari who came in the guise of the aged woman. Now, I am an ant-hill here. Responding to your prayer, I came with Lord Shiva. As my presence had been made known to the world by you, you will be relieved of poverty, continue worshipping me and the Lord.” Within a few minutes the anthill became visible. As the Goddess appeared from Poongavanam, she came to be worshipped as Poongavanathu Amman.
Devotees pray for child boon, those facing problems in wedding proposals and those having family problems, tear a piece from their sari and tie it in the neem tree. Realizing their wishes, they come to the temple, thank the Goddess with pujas. Majority of the devotees pray for child boon. It is also very common for people to stay overnight here on full moon days. A special prayer is conducted at 5 am the next morning for these people who stay awake and pray through the night.
It is believed that one has to remove all “drishti” (casting of evil eye) before entering the temple. So, these women circle the lemon thrice around your head, and ask you to crush it under your left foot. This is supposed to remove all drishti from you. On entering the temple, there is a trident (Trishul) on which three of the remaining lemon are pressed on.
Majority of the devotees to the temple are women. The temple is filled with turmeric and kumkum smell. Women place a lime fruit at the feet of the Goddess keeping their sari pallu also there with some prayer. If the fruit rolls and falls at the sari piece, it indicates their wish will be fulfilled, it is believed. Devotees will give Thula Baram if their prayers are answered.
The temple remains open from 6.00 a.m. to 1.00 p.m. and from 2.00 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.
Shivarathri and Masi Magam crematorium robbery festival in February-March, Aadi Fridays in July-August and New Moon day pujas are celebrated in the temple.

This temple is believed to be very ancient and is said to be over 2000 years old. This town happens to be the birth place of Shri. Sankara Vijayendra Saraswathy (Bala Periyava). The same house has been acquired by the Kanchi mutt and an Adi Shankara temple has been constructed here, there are a devoted Bhaktha family staying here taking care of the temple.
This is an east facing temple with three tiered Rajagopuram. There is an elegant Dwajasthambam facing the sanctum. There is an ancient Nandhi Mandapam where Sri Nandhigeswarar is present, facing the Lord towards the sanctum. There is a spacious ‘Thirukalyana Mandapam’ on the right-hand side after the Rajagopuram, where the God’s wedding is performed. Presiding Deity is called as Sampangi Pitchaaleeswarar. He is housed inside the sanctum, facing east.
Ganapathy, Dakshina Moorthy, Mahavishnu, Brahma, and Durga are the niche idols situated on the sanctum walls. Mother is called as Sivakamavalli. Mother shrine is situated adjacent to the sanctum. Natarajar is present just outside the sanctum, facing south. There is also a small peetam outside the sanctum, where Sri Ambal’s Paadham (Goddess’ feet) is present, which is very rare.

Also, there is a shrine for Sani Bhagwan on the eastern side, facing west.
Sampangi Pitchaaleeswarar:
This temple has an interesting legend attached to it. It is said that this village had lots of Sampangi (flower) plants all over. A man who owned many cows in this village, saw one of his cows going alone in the bushes and pouring milk by its own. Surprised by this act of his cow, the man and few villagers curiously went and cut the bushes off including a Sampangi plant to see what’s under bush. To his surprise, he saw a beautiful Shiva Lingam in the ground which was bleeding as the Axe had hit while cutting off the Sampangi plants.
Guilty of his act, the man cut his own hand off as he felt he had done an irreversible sin. The man’s wife pleaded to Lord Shiva and with his blessings the man got back his hand. Since the Lord evolved from the Sampangi bush and gave the man’s hand as Bhiksha (alm), He came to be known as Sampangi Pitchaaleeswarar.
Pancha Brahma Sthalams:
The river Brahma Aranya was believed to have been created by Lord Brahma. Once when he churned the Arani wood (Arani means fire) to create fire to start the Yagna for Sage Romesa, fire came out initially but on churning further, water came out of it and flown as a river. Since this was created by Lord Brahma from the Arani wood, this is called Brahma Aranya river.
The Brahma Aranya river flows from Andhra Pradesh and merges with sea at Pazhaverkadu. Many sages have meditated at the banks of this river and created many temples. Out of these, in five places they have contained all their meditative powers into Shivalingams and built temples. They are called Pancha Brahma Sthalams, representing the five faces of Lord Shiva and they are:
All these temples are many thousand years old and since they have been created by Sages, the base of the lingam (Avudayar) will be in square shape.

As Poosalar kept Lord Shiva in his heart, worshiped him and built an imaginary temple for the lord, many suffering from heart problems pray to Hridayaleeswarar for a cure. The power of Hridayaleeswarar is so famous that cardiologists in Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur visit Thirunindravur and pray at this Shiva temple before they perform major surgery. Those suffering from heart diseases pray here on Mondays. Devotees perform abishek, archanas and offer vastras to Lord and Mother.
The story of this temple dates back to 7th century during Pallava reign. There was a Shiva devotee living in this place during 7th century called Poosalar. who had a desire to build a temple for Lord Shiva at this place unfortunately he could not find funds for the same. Poosalar finally decided to build a temple for the Lord by himself, as he was well read and knew all the Aagama Vidhis and nuances to build a temple, he wanted to start building the temple in his mind.
He sat under a tree called Iluppai and started meditating. He planned each and every small detail to perfection for the construction of this temple in his mind itself. He also marked an auspicious day to commence the holy work. The temple work progressed in his mind. He built the temple step by step. He had designed everything in his mind right from Vimana, Sanctum, Temple Pond, Compound walls etc., and executed each in detail as per what he had in mind.
After the temple construction work came to a finish. He even had organised all the utensils required for the temple. Finally, he also fixed an auspicious date for Kumbabishekam (consecration) of the temple. He prayed to Lord Shiva to be present for the consecration and offer His blessings. During the same period, a Pallava king called Rajasimha was ruling this part, with his capital as Kanchi (today’s Kanchipuram). He also was a sincere devotee of Lord Shiva and was building a huge beautiful temple for the Lord, at Kanchi.
He named the God as Kailasanathar and the temple as Rajasimmeswaram. The king was too proud to see the grandeur of the temple constructed by him. The king also marked a date for consecration, while the finishing touches were going on at the temple. Lord Shiva appeared in his dream and told him that he cannot make it to the consecration of the king’s temple on the said date and asked him to change the day of consecration, as he had to be present for consecration of another temple built by Poosalar of Thiruninravur.
The king woke up shocked. He wanted to know about the temple which God informed him of. He immediately started with his queen, ministers to see Poosalaar’s temple at Thiruninravur. He came to Thiruninravur the next day and enquired with many people about a new Shiva temple built by Poosalar. Nobody knew anything about the temple but directed the king to the place where Poosalar was meditating under the Iluppai tree. King went and asked Poosalar himself about the temple.
Poosalar, on hearing the king explaining about his dream, was overwhelmed to realize the mercy shown to him by Lord Shiva. Poosalar explained to the king that he had been constructing the temple in his heart (Manasu in Thamizh) and had fixed a date for consecration. Poosalar made the king to look at his heart and realize the temple which he constructed. King was able to see and realize the temple made by Poosalar.
Knowing this Rajasimha was amazed to see the devotion and sincerity of Poosalar. The king himself took all the specifications of the temple which Poosalar had in mind and physically constructed a temple for the Lord here. This temple is also called Manakkoil. As Poosalar originally built the temple for the Lord in his Hridayam, the Lord here is known as Hridayaleeswarar.
The Temple is located at about 350 meters from Thiruninravur Mettu Street Bus Stop, 350 meters from Thiruninravur Ramar Kovil Bus Stop, 1.5 Kms from Thiruninravur Railway Station, 18 Kms from Thiruvallur, 17 Kms from Thiruvallur Vaidhya Veeraraghava Swamy Temple, 15 Kms from Thirumazhisai, 11 Kms from Avadi, 35 Kms from Chennai Central Railway Station, 37 Kms from Egmore Railway Station, 33 Kms from Chennai Airport and 35 Kms from Chennai.

The temple was built during the Pallava period of 9th century as seen from the various inscriptions in the temple. The earliest inscriptions of the temple are dated between 820 and 890 AD during the period of Nripatungavarman. There are inscriptions from the later Chola kings like Rajendra Chola II (1051–1063 AD), Vira Rajendra (1063–1070 AD) and Rajaraja Chola II (1146–1173 AD). The Pallava inscriptions mention this place as Ninravur and some of them quote it as Virudhurajabhayankar-chaturvertimangalam, a sub-division of Punarkottam.
The temple remains open from 07.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. and from 04.30 p.m. to 08.30 p.m.
Thirunindravur:
Once, Mother Mahalakshmi (Tiru) left Perumal due to some reasons, came and stood (Nindra) here, hence, the place came to be known as Tiru Nindra Oor (place).  Her father Samudra Rajan (as Mahalakshmi was born in the milk ocean, the king of oceans-Samudra Rajan is her father) came to her, cooled her anger and asked her to go back to her Lord Perumal, she refused. The king of oceans went to Perumal and begged him to come and take back his daughter Mahalakshmi. Lord asked him to go before him and assured to follow him.
Samudra Raja told Mahalakshmi that he was not her father but she was his “Ennai Petra Thayar” ‘You who gave me birth’ and requested her to come back to Vaikunta and rule the world.  Perumal too joined the compromise, Sri Mahalakshmi went back with Perumal. As Lord responded to the prayer of Bhakta (devotee) Samudra Rajan, He is called Bhaktavatsalan.  As Samudra Rajan said “Ennai Petra Thayar” that came to stay as the name of Mother of the temple.  Also, as prayed by Samudra Raja, they are gracing together in the Wedding Form.
Tirumangai Azhwar Paasurams:
Saint Tirumangai Azhwar was passing through many sacred Vaishnava shrines including Thiruninravur but did not sing on this temple.  Noticing that Azhwar bypassed this temple, Mother asked Lord to get a hymn from the Azhwar.  By the time Lord reached Azhwar, he was in Mamallapuram.  Lord demanded a song Azhwar from this place.  Excited by the simplicity and grace of the Lord, Azhwar sang meaning as follows: “My Lord, protecting the whole universe, came to me to make known his love for the Bhaktas at this sacred Mamallapuram.
He demanded and took a song from me.” Mother Mahalakshmi was not satisfied with one song.  She asked the Lord to go back to Azhwar for the remaining 9 songs as he used to sing 10 for all temples.  Azhwar has already left Mamallapuram and had reached Thirukkannamangai.  He saw Lord with a side look waiting for him and in the Pathigam (10 songs) on Thirukkannamangai Perumal, Azhwar included Thiruninravur Perumal also in the hymns.
Lakshmi Pooja:
As the name suggests, this is the temple for wealth, prosperity and all the wealth in the world. There is a nine-squared matrix drawn in front of the Ennai Petra Thaayar Sannathi as shown in the picture, which has specific numbers. By replicating this matrix in your pooja room and placing one-rupee coins (or any coins such as quarters if you are out of India) on each of the squares, and praying for nine days, it is proven that one’s prayers and wishes are granted. The pooja can be performed by drawing the Yantra in the pooja room on a flat surface using white Kolam powder or with the card that is sold in the temple.
Pooja should be done for nine days by placing one-rupee coins (any coins of same denominations) in each of the boxes, applying sandal paste, kumkum and flowers on the matrix and reciting the Lakshmi Ashtothra. The coins of the previous day are then removed and stored safely and new set of coins are used the next day. After completing nine days of pooja the 81 coins along with thambulam for nine sumangalis are taken to the temple.
The temple priest places the coins at the Thayar’s feet and performs archana. The first Thambulam is then offered to the Goddess. After that, he gives the coins back to the devotee who then deposits the coins in the Hundi outside the shrine. The remaining thambulams are given to other women in the temple. It is preferable to start the pooja on Friday. If the Friday happens to be a full moon day, it is even more auspicious.
Lord Vishnu darshan to Varuna:
It is also said that the Perumal here is always giving dharshan to Lord Varuna.
Pallava King built this temple on Lord’s instruction:
Later days, with the divine instruction of the Lord, a Pallava King had constructed this temple and arranged for Brahmotsavam etc.
Kubera regained his Lost Wealth:
Kubera, the richest god, once lost his wealth and offered prayers to Goddess Ennai Petra Thayar or Sudhavalli and regained his lost wealth. Hence Thiruninravur Bhaktavatsala Temple is also called Sukra Kshetram (holy place of Venus, planet of good fortune) and Kubera Puram.
Dharamadvajan regained his Lost Wealth:
Another legend says that King Dharamadvajan, a descendent of the Surya clan, prayed here in Panguni (March-April) and regained his lost wealth.
It is the faith of people that worshipping Sri Adisesha on Wednesdays with ghee lamp and offering milk porridge – Paal Payasam – as Nivedhana would relieve those affected with snake aspects and from the adverse effects of Rahu-Ketu planets. It also strengthens the benefit of the Mangal Sutra of women. Those facing problems in wedding proposals pray to Lord and Mother. Devotees offer Vastras to Perumal and Mother on realizing their wishes. Women come here to pray since Goddess Sudhavalli is believed to give longevity to their husband’s life. A visit to this temple is said to help people recover lost wealth/glory. So, devotees facing loss of wealth, property disputes and other money problems, visit this temple to regain their lost wealth and glory.
The temple follows the traditions of the Thenkalai sect of Vaishnavite tradition and follows Pancharatna. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day: Ushathkalam at 7 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 8:30 p.m.
Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Bhaktavatsala Perumal and Sudhavalli Thayar. During the last step of worship, nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple.
Brahmotsavam during Panguni (March – April), Panguni Tiruvonam in March-April, birth star days of Sri Vaishnava Acharyas and 12 Azhwars, Chitra Poornima in April-May and Wedding festivals, Deepavali in October-November, Sri Jayanti Utsavam during Aavani, Tirukarthikai in November-December, Tiruadyana Utsavam during Margazhi (December – January), Vaikunda Ekadasi in December-January, Masi Magam in February-March, Thai Pongal and Ratha Sapthami in January-February are the festivals celebrated in the temple.

In days of yore, some traders in gems came to south for business. The group also included an old woman. As an Ambika devotee, she was ever carrying an idol of Mother and used to do worship in all places of the group’s stay. The traders stayed in this place one day. When the old woman tried to take the idol back after usual worship, she could not. The traders too could not move the idol. They stayed there for a day more postponing the journey. Ambica appeared in the dream of the old woman and pointed out a place near the idol and said that Lord Veerabadras was also there. When she informed her dream to the traders, they dug the ground and found the Veerabhadra idol. They installed him and built the temple. As they got the Lord through Ambica, He is praised as Kalyana Veerabhadra.
Presiding Deity is called as Kalyana Veerabhadra. As Lord Veerabhadra was found from the ground here, He is praised as Than Thondri Veerabhadra.

Eri Katha Ramar:
It is believed that this lake was flooded in a storm and the bunds were in the verge of breaking when the villagers prayed to Lord Rama. Lord Rama is said to have created a fence of arrows around the lake that prevented it from breaking whereby the village was saved. The villagers showed their gratitude by building a temple on the banks of the lake for Lord Rama.
Birth of Mudaliyandan:
One of the noteworthy episodes connected with the temple is associated with the birth of Mudaliyandan a disciple and associate of Saint Ramanuja. Saint Ramanuja’s sister Nachiyar Ammal and her husband Vathoola Kula Thilaka Sri Anantha Narayana Dikshitar who stayed in the nearby Nazarathpettai were on a pilgrimage to Tirumala to worship Lord Venkateswara to seek the boon of childbirth. As night fell, they rested at the Eri Katha Ramar temple at Thiruninravur.
During the night, Lord Rama is said to have appeared in the dream of Sri Anantha Narayana Dikshitar promising that a son who was an amsam of Lord Rama would be born to them. When the son was born, they named him Dasarathi, after Sri Rama. Dasarathi became a disciple, devotee and associate of his maternal uncle, Sri Ramanuja and since his demeanor was such as Vishwaksenar, (Senai Mudalvar), he came to be known as Mudaliyandan.

In the days of yore there was demon called Mahishasura. He troubled all human kind. But he was a great devotee of Lord Shiva. Once he meditated upon Shiva and the lord appeared before him. He asked Shiva that he be bestowed with immortality. Shiva granted him a boon saying that he would be killed by one of four women who enter that village. Mahishasura was elated. He was happy that he would never be killed because he thought that no woman could kill him, a powerful demon.
He went on his rampages with this thought. The people and devas could not tolerate him and went to Lord Shiva for help. Shiva said that it was time that women who were to kill him would soon arrive and that would be the end of Mahishasura. Meanwhile, Rama and Sita arrived in this hamlet during their exile. One day when Rama was doing his penance, Sita was bathing in the river nearby. Mahishasura arrived there and looked at Sita.
Sita was scared out of her wits and she ran to Rama and sat on his lap. Rama came out of his trance and took the dry grass by his side and threw it on all four sides. Out of this grass from all four sides four women emerged. Looking at the nymphs Mahishasura was reminded of Shiva’s boon. The four nymphs who were Angala Parameswari, Ponniamman, Marakalathamman and Kaikathamman, looked at Mahishasura and began following him. The demon was petrified and began to run.
Fearing his life, he took the form of a buffalo and hid himself in the Punyakoti river. Angala Parameswari with her eight hands and seated on a lion took a plunge into the river and killed the buffalo with one stroke from her sword. All the nymphs after the death of Mahishasura then prepared to leave the place. The people and the devas surrounded them and pleaded with them to stay on in their village and bless them.
They accepted and each of the nymphs took their posts in the four different directions of East, west, north and south. Angala Parameswari temple is in the eastern side of this hamlet. It is believed that people affected by black magic come here in droves to get the blessing of the deity as she is believed to cure these ailments.

Accordingly, Lord Rama placed four Dharbai grass in the four directions. They took the form of four Devis and ended the life of Mahishasura.

Mudaliandan, also known as Daasarathi, was the son of Anantha Narayana Dikshitar and Nachiyaramma, who was a sister of the illustrious Sri Ramanuja. Mudaliandan was born in the year 1027 after his parents were blessed by Lord Rama in their dreams. He, along with Koorathazhwaan, was a prominent disciple of Swami Ramanuja and rendered yeoman services to his teacher. He was the head of all Sishyas of Ramanuja which earned him the name as Mudaliandan and is believed to have lived for 105 years till 1132. He was born in this site, and hence this temple is considered as the Avathara sthalam (birth place) of Mudaliyandan.
When the elephant named Ashwathama was killed during Mahabharata battle, Yudhistra lied to his Guru that his son Ashwathama was killed. By hearing this news, Drona was distracted and shocked. Using this opportunity, he was beheaded by Dhrishtadyumna. To get rid of this sin, based on the advice of the saint Narada, Yudhistra performed a yagna in this site. Lord Krishna appeared in the form of a green elephant from yagna and blessed him. Hence, he is called as Haritha Varana Perumal in Sanskrit (Haritha mean Green and Varana mean Elephant) or Pachai Varna Perumal in Tamil (Pachai mean Green and Varana mean Elephant). Accepting the prayers of Yudhishthira, the Lord remained here.
The Temple remains open from 07.00 AM to 11.30 AM and 04.30 PM to 08.30 PM.
Among the festivals conducted in this temple, the Brahmotsavam starting from Uthiram Nakshatram in the month of Panguni and Thirunakshatram (birth star) festival of Mudaliandan are celebrated with great pomp for ten days in Chithirai with Satrumurai on Punarpoosam. The Pavithrotsavam is also celebrated in this shrine in the month of Aippasi. The rituals in this temple are done according to the tenets of the Vaikhanasa Aagamam.

By worshipping the Kaala Bairavar here, one can live without the fear of death and with extended life since Lord Shiva appeared as Kaala Bairavar. Also, the Kaala Bairavar protects people from the evil effects of others. Pradosham is considered very sacred sine a monkey got salvation after witnessing Pradosham here. Since Indra’s Brahmaharthi Dhosham got cleared off, this is considered a Dosha Parihara sthalam to clear off Doshams like Pithru Dhosham, Naga Dhosham and Past Birth Doshams.
Marriage prayers are answered since Lord Shiva appeared with his consort in marriage pose to King Chithrasenan. Due to the flow of Ganga water, the place is considered more sacred than Kasi. Goddess is present with her left leg in front meaning that she is going out to fight enemies. So, by worshipping her, she will make our obstacles vanish. Music, Pava Vimochana (Relief from Sin), any boon you wish, Vidhya (Education), Kala Sarpa Dosha Nivarthi.
Pancha Brahma Sthalams:
The river Brahma Aranya was believed to have been created by Lord Brahma. Once when he churned the Arani wood (Arani means fire) to create fire to start the Yagna for Sage Romesa, fire came out initially but on churning further, water came out of it and flown as a river. Since this was created by Lord Brahma from the Arani wood, this is called Brahma Aranya river.
The Brahma Aranya river flows from Andhra Pradesh and merges with sea at Pazhaverkadu. Many sages have meditated at the banks of this river and created many temples. Out of these, in five places they have contained all their meditative powers into Shivalingams and built temples. They are called Pancha Brahma Sthalams, representing the five faces of Lord Shiva and they are:
All these temples are many thousand years old and since they have been created by Sages, the base of the lingam (Avudayar) will be in square shape.
 
Pit at the banks of Brahma Aranya River:
A pit is present at the banks of the Brahma Aranya River, where water, believed to be from River Ganges, is flowing out perennially all though the year, though in small quantity. Due to this, the place is considered more sacred than Kasi and there is a proverbial saying “Kasiya vida Veesai Adhigam”, meaning that the quantity ‘Veesai’ here is more than that of Kasi.
There is also a folk song ‘Ariyathurai Gangai moozhga palan kanden’, meaning ‘I got benefited by taking a dip at the Ariyathurai Gangai’. Kanchi Paramacharya Sri Chandrasekarendra Saraswathi Swamigal had visited Ariyathurai during 1965 and bathed in this holy water. It is said that worshipping the Lord at Ariyathurai is equivalent to worshipping Him at Kasi (Varanasi).
Lord Krishna stood here as a Aswatha tree for 1000 years:
Once Lord Krishna brought a Parijatha flower tree from Devaloka to give flowers to his consorts Satyabhama and Rukmini. Before plugging out the tree, he got permission from Indrani but forgot to ask permission from the tree itself. So, the tree gave a curse to Lord Krishna to stand as a tree on earth and Krishna stood as a tree here for 1000 years. After the curse period the tree became a Ashwatha Vriksham (Arasa Maram).
Sage Romesa penance on Lord Shiva:
At the behest of Lord Brahma, Sage Romesa undergone penance under this tree for 100 years and finally when Lord Shiva appeared before him, the Sage requested him to be present in this place for ever and bless everyone. Lord Shiva obliged Sage Romesa wish.
Sage Mukunthan penance on Lord Shiva:
Later, Sage Mukunthan also penanced under the same tree for some years and then set off to go to Kasi. At that time, a holy voice was heard saying that Ganga water will flow here itself for him. When Ganga water came out from a pit here, Sage Mukunthan took bath in it and Lord Shiva appeared before him as a Kala Bairavar and asked for his wish. Sage Mukunthan requested him that the Ganga water which had started flowing for the sake of him should flow perennially and he should protect from the fear of death all those who worship him here. Lord Shiva obliged Sage Mukunthan wish.
Monkey got Salvation here:
Once on a Pradhosha day, a monkey was chased by a hunter and it came here, came around the Ashwatha Vriksham, took a dip in the water and witnessed the Pradhosha along with the people. Due to this, it got salvation and took birth as King Raja Kunjara Cholan at Kancheepuram. Then he got the memories of his past life, realized the importance of the temple and renovated it. So Pradhosha is considered very sacred here.
Indra got relieved of Brahmahatti Dosham here:
Indhra fought with demon Vridrasuran and when he threw the demon’s body pieces, some fell on Agasthiar and so he cursed Indhra to be a Brahmaharthi. Then Indhra stayed here, worshipped Lord Shiva to get his curse cleared off. It is believed that Indhra continues to come here on a specific day every year.
Chettiar constructed Ambal Shrine:
Goddess shrine came up only in the middle period and the legend being as follows: Pazhaverkadu nearby was a harbour in the past and a diamond merchant Chettiar’s ships sank in the sea. When he was sleeping in a nearby village in a sad mood, God came up in his dream and informed him that the ships have been pushed ashore safely. He also told that an Ambal idol is lying in a nearby pond called Poothakulam between Peruvayal and Eliyampedu. The Chettiar then constructed the Ambal shrine.
Ariya Thurai:
The name of the place Ariya Thurai (Ariya meaning rare and Thurai meaning river bank).
Lord married daughter of Chithrasenan:
There lived a king called Chithrasenan who was childless and Goddess Maragatha Valli Herself was born to him. After she grew up, the king arranged for the Swayamvaram for the princess. Lord Shiva went to the palace, brought the Goddess here on a horse and took abode. Knowing this, the king along with his troupes came chasing and reached here. Nandhigeswarar stopped them from entering the temple and the God gave Dharshan to them along with Sri Maragatha Valli. Then the king was made to realize that the Goddess herself was born to him and she had reached the right place.
Story behind construction of Temple Tank:
There is a beautiful pond near the temple which serves as the Theertham for the temple. This temple tank was built by a local land lord. It is said that there lived a beautiful Devadasi in this village, who was an ardent devotee of Sri Varamoortheeswarar. The land lord was fascinated by her beauty and proposed to her for his pleasure. Devadasi agreed with a condition that the land lord must build a tank for this temple after which she would agree to be with him.

It was here that sage Jamadagni, father of Lord Parasurama, an incarnation of Lord Narayana, did penance. So, the holy place was in existence long before the Ramayana period in the Tretha Yuga.
Though the presiding deity is Lord Veera Anjaneya, he is popularly known as Bala Anjaneya since his features resemble those of a small child. The idol of Anjaneya, carved on a single slab of stone, faces north and is known as Veera Mangala Anjaneyar. It is one of the nine forms of Anjaneya, according to the Parasara Samhita. Lord Anjaneya is seen as walking towards North direction where Tirupati abode of Lord Venkateswara is situated. Lord Veera Anjaneya’s right hand depicts ‘abhaya mudra’ with lotus petals in the palm, the left is found holding a lotus bud close to the chest.
The lotus is known as the symbol of Gyana, Aishwarya, and a symbol of Vijaya; representing Goddess Saraswathi, Lakshmi and Durga. The tail is raised over his head with a bell tied at its end. The small-sized carving of Lord Rama is found over his head. On the back of the idol is found the description of the ten incarnations of Lord Narayana. On his chest is found a carving in silver of Sita-Rama. As the best ornament of a Brahmmachari, he has a tuft and this long hair is tied up and he wears the Vaishnava symbol Thiruman in his long forehead.
He gives his darshan to the devotees through Pingaksha as his eyeball has a golden hue. Vishnu in his incarnation as Narasimha is said to have long sharp teeth known as gorapal. Bala Anjaneya also has gorapal. His long ears ever listening to Ramakatha wears a Panchamukha earring in kundala form. There are also garlands sculptured around his neck. He adorns a mala made of Saligramam – a rare fossil stone, found normally in Nepal. His both arms are adorned with armlets known as keyura, a bracelet known as parihariyajha and a bangle known as kankana in his wrist. He has a dagger at his hip and a long belt around the waist.
In his lotus feet he has two different types of anklets one resting in the foot known as Noopuram, one on his ankle known as thandai. Lord Veera Anjaneya’s shrine has a single – tier vimana. On the southern side of the vimana Yoga Anjaneya with Sangu chakra and mala is found. On the east side is the Bhakta Anjaneya. On western side of the vimana is the Panchamukha Anjaneya with five faces and ten hands. On the northern side of the vimana is the Veera Anjaneya with the right hand lifted towards the sky left hand resting on his waist.
In the main shrine of Anjaneya are also found the Utsava idols of Sri Lakshmi Narasimha, Sri Sudarsana and a dancing Navaneetha Krishna. A small silver idol of Anjaneya with Panchayudha is also found here. On either side of the Moolavar idol of Anjaneya are the images of Sri Sudarsana (Chakra) and Panchajanya (Shanka). Two more shrines — one for Vishnu Durgai and another a Shadgona shrine for Sri Sudarsana with Sri Narasimha on the back have been built recently. The temple rituals are conducted according to the Vaikanasa Agama. A snake, which guarded the temple in the past, is said to be a regular visitor and provision has been made in the outer wall for its entry.
Lord Rama’s shrine has a two tier vimana and in the shrine Lord Rama is found in the “Panchhtra” pose along with his consort Sita, Lakshmana, and Anjaneya. A 26 ft-high Dwajasthambam has been installed before the shrine of Lord Rama. Lord Vinayaka is housed in the shrine which has a single tier vimana. The Navagrahas have a separate shrine, the Navagrahas are found with their vahanas. Saneeswara faces Anjaneya and hence will be more benevolent towards those who worship the Lord here, it is believed. All of them are adorned with silver Kavacham.
A 42-ft-high Sudhai image of Anjaneya, in sitting posture, blesses devotees at the entrance of the temple facing east and laid with marble floor. It has been constructed by the sthapathis of Mahabalipuram, who have also carved the idols of Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, Sudarsana, Vinayaka and the Navagrahas. The maha Kumbabishekam was performed on July 7, 1998 after reinstalling the idol of Lord Veera Anjaneya in accordance with the Pancharatna Agama rules by the Shri Veera Anjaneya Bhaktha Samaj.
The temple is not a stranger to VIP devotees. Sri Lanka’s Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, who visited the temple when he was the Opposition leader, went there again after he won the elections. He spent some time offering worship to the deities and taking part in the many rituals conducted at the temple.
Nallathur is located near Thiruthani, en-route to Tirupati. The Temple is located at about 15 Kms from Thiruthani, 16 Kms from Thiruthani Bus Stand, 14 Kms from Thiruthani Railway Station, 16 Kms from Thiruthani Murugan Temple, 66 Kms from Tirupati, 37 Kms from Thiruvallur, 85 Kms from Chennai Airport and 90 Kms from Chennai.

Solving problems related to wedding, child birth, family troubles. This temple is also supposed to be a Parihara Sthalam for the people born under Makam and Pooram Stars. Those girls seeking suitable marriage alliances, offer garlands of glass bangles to the Goddess Amirthambigai on Fridays and during Navarathri.

After childbirth, they perform the Abhishekam again as a gesture of gratitude. It is desirable for every woman born in this world to worship Goddess Amirthambigai at least once in their life time.
Aavundeeswarar:
After the Pralaya ended, creation of new life was supposed to happen. Lord Brahma, the creator, started his tasks of creation of life again. While in the process of creation it is believed that it is at Nemam that he first sprinkled the holy nectar (Amritam). The Devas had also offered the Amritam first to Goddess of this place, Amirthambigai. Henceforth this Kshetram had been known as the Amirtha Janma Bhoomi.
Being a Janma Bhoomi from where creation started, the Goddess grants prayers of childbirth with kindness and compassion. Over time, the temple had been covered by sand and Lord Shiva waited patiently for the time to come to show himself to the world again. During this time, the cows that were being grazed through this area, used to shower their milk over the hidden lingam.
The cowherd did not understand why the cows were showering their milk on a sandhill. In a fit of anger, raised his whip and started beating the cows. It is believed that Lord Shiva rose from the sandhill and hugged the cows close whereby the whiplashes fell on him. Till today, the marks of a whip striking against him can be seen on the Murthi. As he protected the cows, he came to be known as Aavundeeswarar.
Amrita Shakthi:
Goddess Amirthambigai at Nemam blesses the devotees with the amrita shakti needed for surviving in this world and leading a good life. To get us the above 3 types of amrita shakti, Mother Amirthambigai did severe tapas in this sacred spot and requested the grace of Lord Aavundeeswarar. The Lord not only blessed her with this shakti, He also married her here.

The Temple remains open from 05.00 AM to 01.00 PM and 04.00 PM to 08.00 PM.
In Hindu mythology, any temple facing the South is called Parihara Sthalam, in which one can find remedy for any kind of problems in life. Doing Annadhanam (free feeding) here is considered most auspicious and believed that it will get us back the lost positions, possessions and will help attain God’s feet.

Sukethu’s curse:
Once at Kailasam, when Shiva was teaching the Shiva Philosophy with Parvathi sitting next to him, a yatchan called Sukethu questioned him whether it is ok to teach the philosophy while Parvathy is sitting along. Shiva just smiled but Lord Muruga got angry since Parvathy is always part of Shiva himself and so cursed him to become a demon. He then married another demon and gave birth to 3 sons.
The 3 sons, knowing the curse of his father, did a penance towards Goddess Parasakthi and got all the powers. With this they disturbed everyone in the Celestial world and so all the Devas went to Sage Agasthiar to do something. Agasthiar then prayed to Lord Shiva and he appeared as a Rishaba rudar along with Parvathi, Vinayagar, Murugan and Nandhi Devar and gave the necessary powers to Sage Agasthiar.
Meanwhile Sukethu fought with other demons and on becoming tired went and hid himself under the sea. The 3 sons then searched their father in the sea and created a Pralayam there. All the lives of sea were affected and so Agasthiar just drank the whole sea and it became completely dry.
The Devars then requested Agasthiar to bring back the sea and Agasthiar spit a little water at Pancheshti and it became the ‘Agasthya Theertham’ and let the remaining water back to the sea itself. In the process, Sukethu and his sons were caught inside the stomach of Agasthiar and they requested pardon. Agasthiar then made them take a dip at the ‘Agasthya Theertham’ and conduct five yagnas – Deva Yagna, Brahma Yagna, Pithur Yagna, Bootha Yagna and Manuda Yagna. Finally, they got their curse cleared off.
King Mithrathuvasan:
Once King Mithrathuvasan of Kanchipuram was doing regular Pradhosha pooja here. When he was coming for one such pooja, he heard a crying voice for help and when he went he saw a Tiger about to kill a man who was very lean and bony. When the King told the tiger to leave that poor man, the Tiger replied that it is also old and needs food for it and its kids.
The King replied to take him instead of the poor man since he is hale and healthy but requested to wait till he comes back after the Pradhosha pooja. The tiger accepted and relieved the poor man. As promised when the King appeared before the tiger after the pooja with sacred ash full of body, rudraksha chain around his neck and Pradosha prasadam (Vilvam) in his hand, the tiger hesitated. When he compelled the tiger to take him by voluntarily putting his head inside the Tiger’s mouth, it disappeared and Lord Shiva gave Dharshan as Rishabaroodar along with Parvathi Devi.
He realized that it is just the drama of Lord Shiva just to show him and the world the significance and power of Pradhosha pooja. The place where this happened is being called ‘Thiruvilankeswarar’ a few kms from here and a Shiva temple is present there. Since King Mithrathuvasan came forward to sacrifice himself because he did not want even a Tiger at forest to starve, this place is considered an Annadhana Kshetram.
Indhra, Indrani and Viswaroopan’s curse:
Once Indhra wanted to start a Yagna but since Deva Guru Brihaspathi who normally is the Guru of all yagnas in Devaloka (Brihaspathi) was in tapas towards Lord Shiva, Indran conducted the yagna with Viswaroopan’s as Guru. So, Brihaspathi cursed both of them to take human births. They had born as sons of King Mithrathuvasan in the name of Chandhramoulipriyan and Sambupriyan.
In another incident, while Padmini, daughter of Guberan was taking bath, Sage Romar covered with hair all over his body was passing through and Padmini made fun of him and laughed. So, Sage Romar cursed her to take human birth and to be a wife for two persons since she laughed at the Sage twice. Thus, she took birth as the daughter of King Bhavabanu of Virudhachalam in the name of Ambikai. When the King arranged Swayamvaram for his daughter, demon Sambasuran participated with a fake identity and took away Ambikai.
Chandhramouli Priyan and Sambupriyan who also participated in the Swayamvaram then fought with the demon, won him and both married her. Later demon Sambupriyan again took her way one day. Chandhramouli Priyan and Sambupriyan searched for her everywhere and finally came to Kalahasthi and prayed to Lord Shiva. They then heard the holy voice that Agasthiar who was in tapas at southeast of Kalahasthi will help. They then came to Pancheshti and fell at the feet of Agasthiar. He then made them to create an ashram here and do the Pradhosha pooja.
On one Pradhosha when they were returning to the Ashram after the pooja, they heard a crying female voice and they went and saw their wife Ambikai getting ready to be sacrificed to Goddess Kali by a demon called Sakthiubhasakan who brought her here after killing demon Sambasuran. They both then killed the demon and relieved her. Agasthiar then ended the curse of all the three and they all went to their respective worlds.
Pancheshti:
Once Sages Vasishtar, Gouthama and Kanvar went to Lord Brahma to suggest them a suitable place on earth to do tapas. Brahma then made a wheel out of some Dharbai grass and rolled it over. The place where it stopped is Pancheshti. Sage Agasthiar conducted five yagnas (Pancha means five, Ishti means Yagna) and so the name Pancheshti. Agasthiar was so attached to this place that he didn’t want to return to Kailasam after his work was over. Only Lord Shiva could finally convince him. Since the place is blessed by Agasthiar, there is copious ground water and supplies water to Chennai city whenever there is a scarcity. So, it is called ‘Pancham Theerkum Pancheti’ meaning ‘Starvation solving Pancheshti’.
The Temple is located at about 400 meters from Pancheshti, 1 Km from Thatchur Koot Road, 1.5 Kms from Thatchoor, 8 Kms from Ponneri, 7 Kms from Ponneri Bus Depot, 8 Kms from Ponneri Railway Station, 8 Kms from Chinnambedu, 31 Kms from Chennai and 44 Kms from Chennai Airport.

Saint Valmiki is believed to have taught Lava and Kusa, sons of Rama, the skills of bow and arrow here in this area. Lord Vishnu of this Temple was worshipped by Rama’s twins Lava & Kucha. Also, Sage Valmiki had the darshan of Lord Mahavishnu.
This is an east facing Temple without a Rajagopuram. This temple, even though, appears to be ancient, is very small in size. Lord Vishnu appears in three forms in this temple. The main deity is Varadaraja Perumal / Ooraga Perumal who is in the standing posture and found along with his consorts Sri Devi and Bhoo Devi.
Lord is known as Theenda Thirumeni Perumal since the Bhattachariars, even today, cannot touch the moolavar. On every Karthikai Tamil month, Thaila Kappu (oil cover) is done to Perumal. The Urchavar, a Saligrama Vigraham, is called as Prana Harthi Haran. He is also called as Kannoli Perumal since eye related problems are solved by worshipping him. There is a small idol of Garuda in the shrine facing the presiding deity.
There is a shrine where Lakshmi and Narayana along with Vishwaksenar are found. Here, Vishnu (Narayana) is in the sitting posture and this shrine is called as Lakshmi Narayana shrine. There is another shrine in this temple where the idol is made up of Maragadham (granite) – Srinivasa Perumal shrine, where the Lord is found along with his consorts Sri Devi and Bhoo Devi.
All the metal idols (Utsava idols) are found in the shrine of Varadarajar. Near the shrine of Srinivasa Perumal, there is an attractive idol of Krishna along with Rukmini.

Two noble devotees of Gurudev, from Chennai, donated eight acres of land at Thamaraipakkam on 27th June 1984, to be used for spiritual purposes at the discretion of Poojya Gurudev. Gurudev meticulously planned and gave the blueprints of the unique model of Dhyana Nilayam with a huge 65 ft high Shivalinga-shaped dome, a spacious sprawling circular Satsang hall on the ground floor and the Dhyana Nilayam on the top-floor that was designed by M/s Vybogam Architects. Gurudev laid the foundation on 29th September 1987. Swamiji also laid the foundation for many cottages intended for Senior citizens, called Pithamaha Sadan. The work of construction of the unique Dhyana Nilayam was entrusted to M/s ECC of Larsen & Toubro Limited, who executed the project as desired by Gurudev in record time.
On 15th October 1989, at 10:30am the Maha Kumbabhishekam was performed at a solemn ceremony. A noteworthy feature of this place is that it is one of the rare places in the world with a “Spatika Lingam” – a precious Linga – shaped crystal with a diamond studded crest – brought by Poojya Gurudev. There were great spiritual overtones touching the devotional chords of the devotees including the chief priest of the place, many of whom testified to the thrilling experience of a “Spiritual” shock they experienced as the holy waters collected from the eight famous rivers were being poured by Poojya Gurudev from a silver conch on the “Spatika Lingam”.
The Temple remains open from 06.30 AM to 12.00 Noon and 04.00 PM to 08.00 PM.

Soundara Narayana Perumal Temple is a Hindu Temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu located at Pattarai Perumbudur Village near Thiruvallur Town in Thiruvallur District of Tamilnadu. The Temple is believed to be 1000 years old and built during Chola Period.
Presiding Deity is called as Soundara Narayana Perumal. He is facing east holding the Sankha and Chakra in his upper hands. The lower right hand is in abhaya hasta (blessing devotees), while the left hand is in Kati hasta (resting on his waist). His consorts Sri Devi and Bhu Devi are on either side. Numerous old paintings are visible on the inner walls of the garbha-griha, depicting various forms for Vishnu. These murals, which belong to the time of the late Vijayanagara or Nayak dynasties, can only be faintly seen.
The original deity of this temple was Azhagiya Perumal, a majestic stone image of Vishnu situated in front of the central sanctum. He is in Sitting Posture. This deity, also flanked by Sri Devi and Bhu Devi. A special feature at this temple is that Lord Narasimha is seen in a Padmasana Posture with his left hand in Aadhvaanam and his right hand in Vaikunta Hastham. There is an idol of Thirukachi Nambi (of Poonamallee) leading one to believe that he may have visited this temple.
The other deities in worship are the processional images of Kodandarama, Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman, Bhakta Anjaneya, Garuda, Dhanavanthri and Hayagriva. Many Tamil inscriptions, mostly belonging to the Chola and Vijayanagara dynasties, can still be seen in this temple. An epigraph of the reign of Kulottunga Chola II of the 12th Century AD, registers a sale of land by the Mahasbhai (administrative organization of villages in the Chola times).
Another Chola epigraph mentions a gift of tax-free lands for conducting the procession and for the sacred bath on holy occasions of the deity. There are two Vijayanagara inscriptions dated 1430 AD and 1457 AD. Originally, this is believed to have been a temple for Azhagiya Perumal and this moolavar idol along with Sri Devi and Bhoo Devi are still found inside the temple. However, inscriptions refer to the temple as Soundarya Narayana Perumal temple. A 1044AD inscription indicates that there were gifts of lands to the temple.
An inscription in the South Wall refers to a gift of tax free land by payment of a lump sum amount. Another inscription on the South wall of the temple refers to gift of land for conducting processions and to organize sacred bath for the Lord on holy occasions in the year.  There are several inscriptions on the base of the South, West and North walls of the temple. These inscriptions give us an indication that the temple was well funded to celebrate festivals. This ancient Chola period temple is now in a not so good shape. This temple follows the codes of the Vaikhanasa Agama.
The Temple remains open from 06.00 am to 10.00 am and 06.00 pm to 07.30 pm.
Vaikunta Ekadesi, Vaikunta Dwadasi, Thirumanjanam on Shravanam, Swathi, Moolam and Punarvasu are the festivals celebrated here.

While taking food there, Sri Rama drew a line across the leaf to share it with Sri Anjaneya to acknowledge all the services he rendered during his difficult days in search of Mother Sita and in the battle against Ravana. Both dined on the same leaf sitting opposite to each other. It is said that since the event, plantain leaves began to grow with this partition line.
Magam Star Temple:
Also, the sage is one of the five sages who installed Mother Meenakshi in Madurai. His reputation is beyond the power of words. Despite high power gained through intense penance, the sage was all humble in nature. The two Peetas at the entrance of the temple are said to be Bharadhwaja himself sitting there to have the touch of the feet of devotees on his head. Born in the Magam Star, special pujas are performed in his favour on this day. It is believed that many noble souls and sages partake in the pujas invisibly. It is advised that those born in Magam star should take Sage Bharadhwaja as their Guru and worship Lord Shiva with abishekams and archanas on Magam star days, Panchami, Sashti, Ekadasi, Dwadasi, Pradosham and monthly Shivarathri days to sustain a happy and prosperous life.
The Temple is located at about 2.5 Kms from Viralipatti, 14 Kms from Dindigul, 12 Kms from Dindigul Railway Station, 25 Kms from Natham, 62 Kms from Madurai, and 73 Kms from Madurai Airport. The Temple is situated on Dindigul to Natham Route off the branch road in Viralipatti. The devotee has to take a minibus to reach the temple from this branch way. Auto facility is also available.
The Temple remains open from 7.00 a.m. to 12 noon and 1.00 pm to 6.00 p.m.
Magam Star days, Panchami, Sashti, Ekadasi, Dwadasi, Pradosham and monthly Shivarathri are the festivals celebrated here with much fanfare.
Naturally, Magam people worship here for relief from adverse planetary problems. Special pujas are performed for Lord and Mother on Masi Magam festival day. For remedy from illnesses, devotees light ghee lamps. Those facing Vasthu problems in their houses, also worship here. Devotees perform abishekam and offer Vastras to Lord and Mother.

The Temple is facing east with 5 tiered Rajagopuram with two prakarams. The temple which has a strong granite structure has several inscriptions on the Northern and Southern walls of the prakaram dating back to 1000 years. The temple in its current form and structure is believed to have been built in the early 12th century AD during the rule of Jadavarma Vallabha Pandya. Presiding Deity is called as Chitra Radha Vallaba Perumal. He is almost a 10 ft high sandalwood idol seen in a majestic standing posture along with Sridevi and Bhoo Devi.
Mother is called as Shenbagavalli Thaayar and she is housed in a sperate shrine. Though the primary deity of the temple is actually Lord Vishnu, the temple is famous as Lord Guru’s shrine. Jupiter (Guru) shrine is situated in front of the Eastern Rajagopuram where he is seen facing west – in the direction of the main deity – Chitra Ratha Vallabha Perumal. Lord Guru is called as Yoga Guru.
In fact, Lord Guru in meditating posture and Chakkarathzhwar are seen together in a single shrine and they are said to have emerged Swayambu (on their own) at this place. The idols of 12 Alwars (sage poets who eulogized Perumal) are in a single form. Theertham associated with this Temple is Vaigai River. Vaigai River runs besides the temple adds to the beauty of the temple.
In a war between the Devas and the demons, a huge number of demons were killed. Their Acharya, Shukra, also a powerful planet, restored all the demons to life again through the power of Sanjeevini Mantra application which he alone knew. Devas, with a view to learn that Mantra, sent Kasa, son of Jupiter to Shukra to learn the Mantra and return to them. He went to Asuraloka, the land of demons with the blessings of Father Guru.
Devayani, daughter of Shukra, enticed by the handsomeness of Kasa fell in love with him, but it was a one-sided love. Kasa was keen only on his mission. The demons knowing the young man’s plans, killed him, reduced him to ashes, dissolved it in water and made Shukra consume it. As Devayani was unable to meet Kasa, she begged her father Shukra to find him. Shukra with his wisdom eye came to know the facts and understood he was in his belly.
To please the daughter and to restore Kasa back to life, he taught the Sanjeevini Mantra to him even while he was in his belly. Kasa came out alive tearing his guru’s stomach. As Kasa could not bear to see Shukra dead before him, he applied the same Sanjeevini Mantra and gave a new lease of life to the teacher. Shukra asked Kasa to marry his daughter Devayani. Kasa politely explained to Shukra that as he was born from his stomach, Devayani was his sister and therefore the match would be against law.
He left to his place with Shukra’s permission to his place. But Devayani created seven mountains preventing Kasa’s departure. Worried at the inordinate delay, Guru Bhagwan (Jupiter) undertook penance here invoking the blessings of Lord Narayana to save his son from the Asuras. Hence, this place came to be called as Guru Iruntha Thurai (later Kuruvi Thurai).
Pleased with the prayers, Lord Narayana used his discus (Chakrath Azhwar) to save Kasa from the asuras. He came here on a special chariot and provided darshan to Guru on the Chitra star day in the Tamil month of Chitrai and hence the Lord here is referred to as ‘Chitra Ratha’ Vallabha Perumal.
The Temple is located at about 2 Kms from Kuruvithurai, 20 Kms from Vadipatti, 10 Kms from Sholavandan, 11 Kms from Sholavandan Railway Station, 26 Kms from Batlagundu, 34 Kms from Madurai, 34 Kms from Madurai Periyar Bus Stand, 38 Kms from Mattuthavani Integrated Bus Terminus, 34 Kms from Madurai Railway Junction, 45 Kms from Madurai International Airport.

Chennai to Tirunelveli Nellai Express stops at Sholavandan (4.45 a.m.) From Sholavandan Railway station, one can reach Kuruvi Thurai within 30 minutes.
Garuda Sevai on Vaikunta Ekadasi:
On the Vaikunta Ekadasi day, the Lord goes on a day long procession on the Garuda Vahana through the entire village of Kuruvi Thurai. Later that night, the Lord makes his way on a procession on the Horse Vahana. These are the only two Vahana processions in the year. In olden days, there seems to have been Vahana processions and Brahmotsavam at the temple going by the dilapidated old Elephant and Horse Vahanas. However, currently the Brahmotsavam is not celebrated here.
Chitrai Festival in Thenoor:
In centuries gone by, the Lord used to leave Kuruvi Thurai on a Chariot on a long procession to Thenoor for the Chitrai Utsavam there. He would leave Kuruvi Thurai 10 days ahead of the full moon day in Chitrai so as to reach Thenoor on the day Kallazhagar arrives there from Tiru Maliruncholai.
Vasanthotsavam:
There seems to be a Vasantha Mandapam on the North-West corner of the temple, an indication that a Vasanthotsavam too may have taken place once upon a time but this too has now become a thing of the past.
Guru Peyarchi:
Since it is Guru Parihara Sthalam, Guru Peyarchi day is the biggest day of the year at this temple with lakhs of devotees visiting the temple on that day.

Lord Shiva’s play at Kochadai:
The epic speaking the 64 blessingful events of Lord Shiva has a mention about Kochadai. With a view to take an old lady Vandhi by name, Lord Shiva caused heavy floods in River Vaigai. While one in each family was demanded to repair the breaches caused by the flood, as Vandhi had no one to offer for the job, Lord Shiva himself came to her rescue offering himself for the job, taking the pudding Vandhi was selling for his wage.
King Pandya, dissatisfied with his work caned him in anger – Kovichu Adi – in Tamil. The place also came to be known as Kovichu Adi which in course of time changed to Kochadai. There is a Chokkanatha temple near this place. It is said that this is the original place from where Mother Meenakshi graced devotees.
Muthiah Koil:
Muthiahswami came to Aiyanar in the earlier days looking for asylum. Later he became famous. As he became popular this place came to be known as Muthiah Koil.

The Thiruvilayadal Purana, written by Perumbatta Puliyur Nambi and later amended by Paranjothi Munivar, says that the Chola king, who could not win the battle against the Pandya ruler, sought the help of Jains. They created a giant elephant using their mystic powers and directed it to kill the Pandya king and destroy his capital. But the Pandya prayed to Lord Siva to save him and his capital. The Lord sent to him the “Narasinga Asthram” (the eight-lettered word Namo Narayana), which turned the elephant into a hill. To commemorate this event, a stone elephant was installed in Madurai near the Vaigai facing the north, which is found near the Yanaikkal bridge even today.
Yanaimalai is considered a sacred place by the Tamil Jain. Jain monks lived here during the Pandyan Dynasty. Yanaimalai has been historically important with its historical monuments and other sources of cultural ethos since the Sangam age, which is about one thousand and eight hundred years old. This hill is fondly called by the people as Yanaimalai (elephant hill), from very early period, as it looks like an elephant. The hill is the historical source as it has early caves with epigraphical records and sculptures and inscriptions of the Early Pandya, Later Pandya, Chola and Vijayanagar – Nayak rulers.
The top of the hill has Tamil Brahmi inscriptions of the 1st century A.D. This historic hill was sung by one of the three great Saiva Nayanmars, Tirugnanasambandar, as the dwelling place of the Jains. Paranjothimuni, in his Thiruvilayadal purana, mentions that this hill was originally an elephant incited by the Jains to destroy Madurai. When Lord Siva threw an arrow at it, it became a stone elephant and thus is called Yanaimalai. The Jains believe that the Saints who authored one of the Sangam classics, Naladiyar, lived in this hill.
The Jains reverentially consider Yanaimalai as one of the eight Jain centers located around Madurai. Though the Jains, Vaishnavites and Saivites were competing each other to promote their respective religions in this region, in due course, they seem to have maintained toleration to each other. This is evident from the records available at Yanaimalai. It has the credit of accommodating the historical monuments from Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Jainism.
The Jain Cave Temple Complex is located at about 2 Kms from Othakadai Bus Stop, 6 Kms from Thirumohur, 6 Kms from Thirumohoor Kala Megha Perumal Temple, 10 Kms from Madurai, 12 Kms from Madurai Periyar Bus Stand, 5 Kms from Mattuthavani Integrated Bus Terminus, 12 Kms from Madurai Railway Junction, 11 Kms from Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple and 22 Kms from Madurai International Airport.

In 2010, the government of Tamil Nadu tried to set up a sculpture garden on the hill, but backed out after locals and activists protested against the idea. The Ladan temple has been declared a protected monument by the Archaeological Survey of India. A small lane adjacent to the famous Lord Yoga Narasimhar Temple leads visitors to a rocky terrain and then to the Ladan Cave Temple, which is built in the style of early Pandya period.
The Thiruvilayadal Purana, written by Perumbatta Puliyur Nambi and later amended by Paranjothi Munivar, says that the Chola king, who could not win the battle against the Pandya ruler, sought the help of Jains. They created a giant elephant using their mystic powers and directed it to kill the Pandya king and destroy his capital. But the Pandya prayed to Lord Siva to save him and his capital. The Lord sent to him the “Narasinga Asthram” (the eight-lettered word Namo Narayana), which turned the elephant into a hill. To commemorate this event, a stone elephant was installed in Madurai near the Vaigai facing the north, which is found near the Yanaikkal bridge even today.
The adjacent Narasimhar Temple was built by Parantaka Nedunchadaya Varaguna Pandya in 770 A.D. Probably, the Pandya kings built the Vishnu and Muruga Temple at the foot of the elephant hill as a countercheck to the then flourishing Jainism. The Temple was named after the presence of Lada Sanyasi, whose sculpture is inscribed at the base of the stairs. It is believed that Sanyasi was from Bengal, which is referred as Lada Desam.
This rock-cut temple, dedicated to Lord Muruga and his consort Goddess Devasena exclusively, belongs to eighth century A.D. Huge tusk-shaped staircase from either side leads to the front mandapam where the peacock and a cock stand on two pilasters (half pillars) on the left and right side. The front mandapam also has sculptures of saints and kings who are all attentive to the orders of their Lord. The roof is held by the dwarf structured goblin freeze (boothakanagal).
The rectangular sanctum sanctorum has Lord Muruga and his consort Goddess Devasena, on his left. Here, Lord Muruga has a band of flowers (kannimaalai) on his head and crossed chain (channaveeram) on his chest. Similarly, Goddess Devasena is decked beautifully in well-designed dress materials and locks of hair are intrinsically carved to give the feel of a wonderful modern hairdo.
This extra care in dressing and the bunch of flowers may lead all to believe that this was the venue of the reception. Apart from these structures, the presence of peacock and cock doubly ascertain that the sculpture is that of Lord Muruga. The pillars and walls of the cave temple are decorated with fully blossomed lotus flower either in square or octagonal-shaped designs besides the wavy corbels (tharangapodigai) on the pillars.
On the eastern wall there is a ‘Vatteluthu’ inscription that bears a sentence indicating the renovation work that was taken up in the ninth century A.D. The sentence is “pullari vattakuruchi Nambiran patta somayaji parivirajakar pudukku.” ‘Pullari vattakuruchi’ would probably refer to the place while ‘somayaji’ refers to a Brahmin and ‘parivirajakar’ the name of the person and the word ‘pudukku’ refers to renovation work.
Ladan Cave Temple is situated to the south of the Narasinga Perumal temple. The Temple is located at about 2 Kms from Othakadai Bus Stop, 6 Kms from Thirumohur, 6 Kms from Thirumohoor Kala Megha Perumal Temple, 10 Kms from Madurai, 12 Kms from Madurai Periyar Bus Stand, 5 Kms from Mattuthavani Integrated Bus Terminus, 12 Kms from Madurai Railway Junction, 11 Kms from Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple and 22 Kms from Madurai International Airport.

https://www.bharattemples.com/alanthurai-nathar-temple-thirpullamangai/,"The temple should have existed as a brick structure from 7th Century. The stone templeshould have been built during the reign of Parantaka Chola I, which is evident from the inscriptions found in the temple. There are also inscriptions from the period of Sundara Chola, Aditya Karikalan and Rajaraja Chola.
Earliest References:
Earliest references to this temple are found in “Panniru Thirumurai” (Twelve holy scriptures), a famous collection of Saivite devotional hymns in Tamil, compiled during the middle ages. The first three books of Thirumurai collection contain hymns on various temples of Lord Shiva sung by Saint Thirugnana Sambandar, a child prodigy who lived during early part of Seventh century AD. One of the temples sung by Sambandar in Chola Mandalam area (present day Thanjavur, Kumbakonam and Thiruvarur districts of Tamilnadu) is the Thiruvalanthurai Mahadeva temple at Pullamangai.
On epigraphical grounds, this temple can be identified with the one at present day Pullamangai. From these references, we see that the temple was already in existence and in worship during early 7th century AD. Saint Sambandar’s hymns (Thirumurai 1.16. 1 – 1.16.11) throw interesting light on the state of affairs at Pullamangai, during this early period. Mentioning the name of the place only as Pulamangai and not Pullamangai in all the eleven hymns, Sambandar hails the natural springs that were abound in this area (1.16.1,2,6,7,11). He also makes a curious remark about the many owls that were singing from their tree homes (1.16.5).
Hymns 1.16.2,4 and 11 seem to suggest that an early course of river Cauvery was running near the temple, during Sambandar’s times. This is not the case as of now. An epigraph from Chakkarapalli – a nearby place – suggests that the river might have changed its course during the latter half of 10th Century AD. It is very likely that the structure that stood during Sambandar’s period was made out of brick and timber, constituting the Sanctum Sanctorum and probably an Artha and Mukha Mandapas. It should have been worshipped by the local devotees and those from nearby areas.
Beyond Sambandar, we do not find any mention about the temple, either from Saint Thirunavukkarasar – his contemporary or from Saint Sundarar, who comes a little later. Thus, it is safe to assume that the temple did not rise to major prominence during 7th / 8th Century AD. At least one more temple by name Thiruvalanthurai existed in South India during Sambandar’s times. This was located in a place called Pazhavoor identifiable with the present day Keezha Pazhavoor in the Ariyalur District of Tamilnadu. This temple has also been glorified by the Saint in 11 stanzas.
Chola Period:
The temple was constructed under the joint reign of Aditya-I and Parantaka-I, a time of intense temple building across Tamil Nadu. Aditya converted several ancient Shiva temples into more permanent granite structures on both banks of Cauvery River, while Parantaka provided a golden roof for the ancient Shiva temple at Chidambaram. But of all their works, the Temple at Pullamangai is undoubtedly the finest example of what is now known as the Parantaka School of architecture.
Going by the inscriptions and other archeological evidences, it is surmised that this temple might have been built during the early years of Chola king Parantaka Choladeva-I (907-953 AD). During Parantaka’s reign, the kingdom was at war many a times, but still the pious act of converting early Saivite brick temples to granite structures continued without many setbacks. This temple came under the royal attention of Parantaka during his reign who subsequently reconstructed it in stone.
The garbhagriha (sanctum) and the Arthamandapam (secluded hall) of the temple belong to the earlier structure, while there have been newer structures added to it lately. All the parivara (consort) shrines of the earlier period have not survived and few newer shrines have come up. The sculptures of this temple are highly acclaimed for its beauty.
Apart from the lovely Devakoshtam (divine) images of Dakshinamurthy, Lingothbhavar,Brahma and Durga, the vimana(shrine) too houses exquisite images of Vishnu, Narasimha, Tripuranthaka. The temple has series of miniature panels depicting scenes from Ramayana. The sculpting in this temple is of high class and speaks volume of Chola artistry.
Nayak & Maratha Period:
This Temple was later renovated by Vijayanagara ruler Veera Sumbanna Udayar with sanctions of land for temple maintenance. He also built the Rajagopuram for this Temple. The then Thanjavur Maratha king Prataba Simhan, who was paying tax to the Arcot Nawab delayed the payment once. Exasperated, the Nawab, invaded Thanjavur twice. The second army of the Nawab Anwaruddin camped near the Pasupathi Koil village and began attacking the temple with a tanker.
In retaliation, king’s commander Manojiappa gave a fitting fight and defeated the Nawab and captured him. Thus, the place and the temple were subjected to successive calamities and was renovated by the King Prathapasimha. One can find a mix of Cholas, Nayakar and Maratha cultures in the temple now.
Present Status:
After the days of kings were over, there was none to take care of the temple and its maintenance leading to its poor condition. Many beautiful sculptures had been robbed and there is no trace of them. The first corridor (prakara) was almost floored off. The Goddess and her shrine were almost destroyed. Bats were flying.
The temple is incarnated by the hymns of Thevaram, the 7th century Tamil literature and is classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. This is the 133rd Devara Paadal Petra Shiva Sthalam and 16th Sthalam on the south side of river Cauvery in Chozha Nadu. Tirugnanasambandar has sung hymns in praise of Lord Shiva of this temple. Praised by Saint Gnanasambandhar in Thevaram Blue necked, adored by Kondrai flowers in hair, Ganga occupying his head, my Lord in Alandurai surrounded by fragrant gardens, let us worship his Lotus feet ever.
Saptha Mangai Sthalams:
This is one of the seven temples (Saptha Mangai Sthalams) and also praised in the hymns of saint Tirugnanasambandar who lived in the seventh century. Thiruchakkarapalli is the first in this series. These seven temples were worshipped by the Sapthamadhas – Ariamangai, Chakkara Mangai, Shoola Mangai, Nandhi Mangai, Pasu Mangai (Pasupathi temple), Thazha Mangai and Pulla Mangai and also the Saptha Rishis (seven sages).
Alanthurai Nathar:
Shiva is said to have consumed the poison that emanated from the churning of the milky ocean here – hence he is called as Alanthurai Nathar.
Pullamangai:
It is also believed that Parvathi Devi is said to have taken the form of a Chakravaha bird and worshipped Shiva here, hence the name Pullamangai. Some sources say that the name Pullamangai is sourced from the Kites that live in the Temple Tower.
Naga Shakti Shrine:
This temple is so special that the eight Ashta Naga Devas offered 300 million Nagalinga flowers in worship here on a Shivaratri night. So, it is at this Naga Shakti shrine that the Mother Goddess got the darshan of Shiva with the divine snakes sporting on his neck.
Kamadenu worshipped Lord Shiva here:
This temple was worshipped by the Divine Cow Kamadenu. This is depicted in a sculpture.
Maada Kovil:
A Chola king, Kochengat Cholan was a spider in his previous birth, spun webs on the Shivalinga and worshipped Lord Shiva. The spider spun the webs to prevent birds spitting on the Linga and falling of stale leaves in the Lord. Knowing not the Bhakthi of the spider, an elephant, also a Shiva devotee performed abishek to the Lord with water from Cauvery, thus removing the spider web. The spider entered into the ears of the elephant. Unable to bear this torture, the elephant struck the ground strongly with its tusk and died killing the spider too. Both reached the Feet of Lord Shiva simultaneously.
The spider begged the Lord to grant him a royal birth and was born as Kochengat Cholan and built temple which elephants could not climb. These temples are called Mada temples. Based on this story and the services of Kochengat Cholan, these events are sculpted in the templetower in small size. Scientifically too, these Mada Temples are considered a means to protect people of Cauvery delta villages from heavy floods.
Alanthurai:
As the site is located on the banks of Kudamurutti river with the banyan tree as the Sthala Vruksha, it was called as ‘Alanthurai‘ in the olden days. ‘Aalam’ means banyan and ‘Thurai’ means ‘river banks’.
Brahmapureeswarar:
Brahma got rid of his curse in this temple; hence, Lord Shiva is also called asBrahmapureeswarar here.

The place was called as Pavathaayamangalam during Pallava Period and was called as Nitha Vinotha Valanattu Kizhar Kutrathu Pavathayamangalam during Chola Period. During Sundara Chozhan’s regime, there were great floods in Kaveri due to which all the villages including Thazhamangalam were completely washed away. The only structure remaining untouched was this temple.
There is a small entrance arch. The Temple is very small with just single prakaram. Nandhi and Balipeedam are found facing the sanctum. There is no Dwaja Sthambam in this Temple. Presiding Deity is called as Chandramouleeswarar and Mother is called as Sri Raja Rajeswari. There are not that many temples where the Mother Goddess manifests herself in her Rajarajeswari form. So, this temple is quite special.
The temple remains open from 06.00 a.m. to 11.00 a.m. and 04.00 p.m. to 08.30 p.m.
Mahasivarathri in February-March, Aipasi Annabishekam in October-November and Margazhi Tiruvadhirai in December-January are the festivals celebrated in the temple. This Temple is one of the seven places forming seven Holy Kshetras in and around Pasupathi Koil where the annual Saptha Sthanam festival is held in the month of Panguni. The Deities from the main temple Chakkarapalli are taken in a procession in very huge “kannadippallakkoo” weighing more than 2000 Kgs by bearers on bare foot over more than 40 Kms in two days nonstop except for few hours halt at Kudamurutti river sands for the fireworks show at 4 am.
Those who are burdened with lack of peace in the family should resolve to do regular worship at this temple on Tuesdays, Fridays and on the night of the darshan of the third phase of the crescent moon. This steadfast worship will help bestow peace and tranquility in one’s family.
Chandramouleeswarar:
When Chandran was afflicted with Daksha’s curse for being partial to Rohini, He came along with his wife to this Thazha Vanam and performed penance, though the area was infested with lot of snakes (even today, in the villages in TN, people do not use Thazhampoo much as it is believed to attract snakes). She got relief for her husband by this worship. Lord took the third phase of the Moon and kept it on his Head. Hence, he is called Chandramouleeswarar / Indusekharan / Chandrasekharan.
Thazha Mangalam:
Once, this area was full of Thazha trees (Screw pine flower) and hence came to be called Thazha Mangalam.
Moondram Pirai Darshnam:
It is believed that on the sixth day of Navarathri (Sashti), Parasakthi visits this temple in the company of another Sapthamadha, Mahendri (this form of Mother is out of Indra and also known as Indrani). The darshan for the Mothers in this Temple is called Moondram Pirai Darshnam.
Thazha Mangai:
Sapthamadha, Mahendri bowed and prayed Lord Shiva here (bowing in Tamil is called Tazh Panidhal). Hence, this place came to be called Thazha Mangai.
Mother appeared as an elderly mother to Nadha Sharma couple:
In this temple, Mother appeared as an elderly mother to the Nadha Sharma couple during their visit here.
Mukthi Sthalam:
One of the sayings of the Siddhas is “Chithirai Sadayam Muthi Thara Thazhayam” (Worshipping the Lord on the Sadayam star of Chithirai month ensures Mukthi).  Hence having darshan of the Lord on that day which falls in April-May and applying sandal paste to the Lord, is considered very auspicious. This is believed to give contentment and happiness for three generations.
Sandal Alankaram:
When Rajarajan was constructing the Thanjavur Big Temple, there was a problem in installing the Great Nandi. He consulted Karuvurar, one of the 18 Siddhars. He came to this temple along with the King’s family, prepared Sandal paste and arranged for Sandana Kaappu (Sandal decoration of the Lord). The pleased Lord ensured that there was no further hurdle in installing the Nandi in Thanjavur. The grateful King started visiting this temple on every Sadayam (his birth star) and repeated the Sandal Alankaram. The fact that his monumental work is viewed with awe even today, is enough proof for the effectiveness of prayer in this temple.
People worshipped Lord Shiva here:
Chandran, Chaya Devi, Agasthiyar and Rajaraja Chozhan worshipped in this temple.
Parihara Sthalam for eye related problems:
This is also Parihara Sthalam for eye related problems. The affected person should come to this temple, grind the sandal paste and arrange to decorate the Lord. He / She should also arrange for decorating the Ambal with Thazhampoo. This is to be done on Sundays (if right eye is affected) and Mondays (for left eye) after observing Mouna Vratham (total silence). Locals believe that this ensures complete cure from the eye problems.

https://www.bharattemples.com/agneeswarar-temple-neyveli-thiruvallur/,"In 2004, when two Shiva devotes visited Oondreeswarar temple at Poondi village. After their visit there, a village boy appeared and directed them to visit a nearby Shiva lingam at Neyveli village and disappeared. In the village, they found no Shiva lingam / temple and after persistent search, the villagers showed them a mound of thorny shrubs and wild weeds which they said is the only place which they had not explored due to the movement of snakes. On clearing the place, they found a beautiful, shining Shiva lingam with only the top (Rudhra) portion exposed under the clutches of the massive roots of a big Kallala tree (banyan without the hanging roots).
The lingam was present very fresh as if daily poojas were taking place. Kallala tree is the one under which Lord Dhakshinamoorthy sits. The two people then heard about Vadapalani Ramamoorthy who is doing the temple related services for more than 3 decades and informed him the details about this Lingam. Then, Sri Ramamoorthy, Sri Muragashram Swamigal and Dr. Sathyamoorthy ex-director of ASI and the current chief patron of REACH foundation visited the place and they had a terrific experience. When they tried to enter the sanctum hutment, a whirlwind dust storm supported by heavy rain started without any warning all of a sudden. They had to go and embrace the nearby trees in order not to be thrown away freely.
The Kallala tree started swinging wildly and an army of beetles flew all over the place and chased the people away. All these happened within that very small area of few 100 meters radius. Even the nearby villagers did not believe it when they arrived at the village in shambles fully wet. Later it was told in the Deiva prasannam that Siddhars were in the middle of their worship and since it got disturbed, they got into all these problems. It was then decided that this is not a normal place and had to be handled very carefully. Then, Deiva prasannam was conducted by two eminent experts, one from Chennai and the other, a Namboodri from Kerala.
Without one knowing what the other said, surprisingly both gave more than 90% matching information such as: the main deity is Agneeswarar. It is believed that the 18 siddha purushas among whom the two most prominent duo Karur Devar and Nerur Sadhasiva Brahmendra worship this deity in Sukshuma Roopa even today during midnights. There is also pond called Agni Theertham on the north-eastern part of this temple, which is believed to have spurted from the third eye of Lord Shiva. A dip in this pond will eliminate any kind of Sarpa Dosha.
The Kallala tree without hanging roots is the adobe of Vana Durga (Mother Kali, Goddess of forests) and 9 rishis are penancing below this tree. It was revealed during prasannam that the Adivasis who lived here have worshipped this Kali as their main deity in ancient days and the divine presence of Kali is still felt even today in this tree. It is believed a Siddhar in the form of Snake, lives in this tree make occasional appearances during Pradhosha Kaala poojas even today.
The Poondi area is historically a place where the ancient stone age people lived – remember they lived near the water bodies. The Gudiyam caves near Poondi has pre-history caves where stone age people lived. On the way to Neyveli from Poondi, the vast area on the right side has been fenced and being protected by Archeological Survey of India. There is a permanent museum of the finds of the stone age people discovered from these areas.
The Temple is located at about 2 Kms from Neyveli Bus Stop, 4 Kms from Poondi, 10 Kms from Thiruvallur, 12 Kms from Thiruvallur Bus Stand, 14 Kms from Thiruvallur Railway Station, 53 Kms from Chennai and 58 Kms from Chennai Airport. From Thiruvallur, take the road towards Thiruthani / Thirupathi. After 2 Kms, there will be a road (bus route) to Poondi / Uthukottai on the right side which goes along the periphery of the Poondi reservoir (on the left). After 7 Kms on that road, there will be Poondi Junction (Poondi Koot Road). From there, the temple is around 1 Km on the village road towards right.

Bhavani Amman, Sister of Lord Krishna:
According to Hindu Mythology, King Kamsa got his beloved sister Devaki married to Vasudeva. Driving the chariot back home along with the newlywed couple, he heard an oracle stating that the eighth baby born to his sister will be the cause of his death. The evil Kamsa grew furious immediately and decided to kill his sister instantly. Vasudeva pleaded Kamsa not to kill his wife and instead promised to handover all his children to him immediately after birth. Despite Vasudev’s promise, Kamsa got the couple arrested and put them in a prison.
As time passed, Vasudeva handed over every baby born to Devaki to Kamsa. Kamsa is said to have killed six babies of Devaki, the seventh one being Balarama who was transferred to Rohini’s womb without Kamsa’s knowledge. Rohini was another wife of Sri Vasudeva. Kamsa was anxiously waiting for the birth of Devaki’s eighth baby. Lord Vishnu incarnated as Lord Krishna and was born to Devaki as her eighth child. Lord Vishnu himself ordered Vasudeva to place Krishna by the side of Nandagopan’s wife Yasodha in Brindavan and to bring back her girl child Mayadevi to prison along with him.
He is said to have explained the purpose of his birth which was to kill the evil king Kamsa. He also informed them that he would be growing up as Nandagopan and Yashodha’s son in Brindavan while their daughter Mayadevi would be brought back to the prison on the night of the birth, to make Kamsa believe that it was Devaki’s child. On knowing about the birth of Devaki’s eight child, Kamsa came to the prison wanting to kill his messenger of death. When Kamsa tried to kill Mayadevi, considering her to be the eighth child of Devaki and Vasudeva, Goddess Mayadevi is said to have kicked Kamsa’s chest and flew to the skies.
She also warned him that his messenger of death was already born and will reach him on the right time to bring his end. The angry Kamsa sent many demons in search of lord Krishna who was growing up with Yasodha in Brindavan. One among them was the evil Boodagi, who came with pretext to breast feed baby Krishna. The divine Lord eliminated Boodagi and the subsequent demons Sakatasura and Trunavartha who were sent by Kamsa to kill him. Lord Krishna grew up to become a naughty boy in Brindavan who stole butter along with his friends, from the villager’s house.
He also ate mud as a little boy and stunned Mother Yasodha when he showed the entire universe on his little mouth. Goddess Bhavani is the same Mayadevi who warned Kamsa and came to Periyapalayam. She is the sister of Lord Krishna. The benevolent goddess is believed to have manifested herself on this earth to relieve human beings of distress and spread happiness and prosperity to the entire world.
Local folklore about the Temple:
According to local folklore, the place where the temple now stands was once a forest where cows from a nearby village used to graze. At exactly noon, one of the cows would drink water at the river and spray milk on a small rock nearby. The cowherd could not understand why this cow never had any milk for him and resolved to sell the animal. But before that, he decided to observe the cow for an entire day.
When he saw the cow give all its milk to the rock, he took an axe and cracked the rock into two. Immediately, the cowherd fell, bleeding from his mouth and nose. Out from the broken rock stepped a woman dressed in yellow and red. She told him that if he would build a shrine for her, his life would be spared. And thus, was born the Bhavani Amman temple.
Angapradakshinam: 05.00 AM – 09.00 AM
The temple attracts thousands of people during the Tamil months of Adi and Avani especially during the weekends. The first Friday in the auspicious Tamil month of Aadi, is grandly celebrated here.

Bhavani Mata wipes off the sins of devotees who wear Margo leaves round their waist and go around her temple day and night. It is enough if her Abhisheka water is sprinkled on couple. All diseases will be cured by the merciful Bhavani Mata who is another form of Sri Krishna himself. Devotees offer prayers in different forms like head shaving, going with just neem leaves around, lifting the pot with fire, Angapradakshina, coconut rolling etc. People come in tractors, vans and carts with full equipments including gas cylinders for cooking, stay here and do their rituals.

https://www.bharattemples.com/tirupporur-murugan-temple-kanchipuram/,"The Tirupporur Murugan Temple is considered as the place of the sacred war. It is one of the 33 major temples of Tamil Nadu and is dedicated to Lord Muruga. This temple is situated 25-km away from Chingleput and 45-km from Chennai. This ancient temple dates back to the Pallava period.
The Tirupporur Murugan Temple is called by names like Poriyur or Yuddhapuri or Samarapuri. According to the legends, after defeating Soorapadman at Tiruchendur, Skanda destroyed the rest of the demons at Tirupporur.
History of The Temple
At the temple there are inscriptions that belong to the early 10th century. There are inscriptions also belonging to the period of Vikrama Chola of the 12th century in the temple. After the glory of Tirupporur reached its peak, it faded into oblivion for some time.
But Chidambara Swamigal rediscovered and renovated its glory in the middle of the seventeenth century. It is said that Tirupporur was a descendant of one of the poets of the “Tamil Sangam” of Madurai. Previously this place was a forest covered totally by Palmyra trees.
It is believed that the idol of Lord Muruga (also spelt as Murugan) is “Swayambhu Murti”, which lay covered up by an anthill. It is said that the image of ‘Skanda’ was discovered by Chidambara Swamigal in the anthill. He then built the temple again and reinstalled the image. Later the temple was looked after by the decedents of Chidambara Swamigal and reached its present glory.
¤ Worship
The presiding deity here is offered four worship services each day.
Festivals
The temple festival celebrated here is the Skanda Sashti, celebrated in the month of Aippasi (October-November). Other festivals that are celebrated over here include “Margazhi Tiruvadirai” and “Navaratri”.
The eastern side of the temple is sanctum sanctorum where there’s a ‘Palmyra’ tree. The anthill under it, has “Kanda Perumal” with “Valli” and “Devayanai” on a small Peetha. Chidambara Swamigal used to perform Abhishekam to these images. There’s an image of the lord present in the anthill which is covered with Kavacha and other jewels without the ritual of Abhishekam (also spelt as Abhisheka) performed for this deity.
The temple has a hall having 24-pillars and another circular hall having 30-pillars. There is a shrine to “Vembadi Vinayaka” under a Neem tree. On the southern side of the temple, there are two sacred Teerthams (also spelt as Teerthas or Theertahs), “Saravana Poigai” and “Valliyar Odai”. Mandapam on the eastern side of the Teerthams has four pillars. There is also another Teertham by name “Pranavamritam”.
The Tirupporur Murugan Temple has many legends related to it. According to one of the legends, Lord Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi were subjected to the curse of Kanva rishi. Lord Shiva came to this place to liberate and relieve them from the effect of the curse.
Therefore at Tirupporur temple both Lord Shiva and his son Muruga are worshiped. According to the Sthalapurana, Lord Muruga with his consorts Valli and Devayanai granted protection to devas and explained the meaning of Pranava to Agastya Muni at this place.
Other legend says, Skanda described the principle of pranava or reality to the devas here. The very concept of Pranavam is said to have worshiped Skanda here, and the hill behind the temple is known as “Pranava Malai’. Legends also say that Lord Vishnu worshiped Shiva as “Vanmeekeswara” on the Pranava Hill. He did this to get rid of the sin of having killed Soorapadman.
Skanda is enshrined in several forms in this temple, all of them related to legends from the Skanda Puranam. The best of these is the depiction of Skanda as a warrior, “Samhara Subramanya”. Skanda is also enshrined in the form of a child, explaining the meaning of the oneness of creation Om to his father Lord Shiva.

Siddas, Saints and Other Devotees: 
This is the place where Arunagirinathar attained Astama siddhi. When Arunagirinathar stayed in Vayalur, Muruga came in his dream and asked him to come to Virali malai saying, “Yemmai pugazhndu paada yamuraiyum Viralimalaikku varuga”. Anrunagirinathar sung 16 Tirupugazh songs on Virali malai Murugan.
Also Vasistar and his wife Arundathi got Sapa Vimochana by worshipping Viralimalai Murugan. (There is a story behind this.. Arundathi is one of the Karthigai mathar who took care of Muruga in his childhood. All the other five feeded milk to kulandai murugan but only she didnt give milk. On seeing this Vasistar got angry and punished her(Saapam). On seeing this Muruga got angry and he inturn gave saapam to Vasistar). Also Kachiappa Munivar(Father of Soorapadman) and Naradar also got Saapa Vimochanam from this Murugan. As a proving factor for these facts, ther are carvings for Vasistar, Arundathi and Naradar on pillars.

https://www.bharattemples.com/arupadai-veedu-temple-pazhamuthicholai-madurai/,"Arupadai Veedu – Pazhamuthicholai, madurai
Pazhamutircolai is situated 19 kilometres from the temple town of Madurai. The place is full of natural beauty and sylvan surroundings. This hill is also known as Vrishabhadri or Idabagiri. At the foot of the hill is situated Azhakar Kovil, which is one among the 108 divyadesams sanctified by the hymns of Azhwars sung in praise of the Vishnu enshrined in this temple. Atop the hill Lord Muruga stands majestically in the temple as the Lord of the Hills popularly known as Kurinji Nilakkizhavan in Tamil. The temple of Pazhamutircolai can be reached by a motorable road leading to the hill.
Pazhamutircholai is mentioned as the sixth of Lord Murugan’s Aaru Patai Vidukal, the six holiest Murugan shrines described by Cankam poet Nakkirar in his poem Tirumurukarruppatai. Regarding the identity of the sixth major site, there is no consensus among scholars and many local temples are ascribed the distinction. Most scholars, priests and devotees identify Pazhamutircholai with the shrine of Palamutircolai, twelve miles north of Madurai in the Alagar Hills, above the Alagarcoil Vishnu temple. While this temple is not as large or bustling as the other five recognized shrines, it is just as incredible to visit.
This shrine is located on the northern outskirts of Madurai in a pleasant wooded hill not far from Alagar Visnu Kovil, a fortified temple complex revered as one of the 108 abodes of Vishnu glorified by the hymns of the Alwars. At the top of the hill, is Noopura Ganga, a perennial waterfall with a temple dedicated to Rakkayi Amman. The Nûpura Ganga atop the hill is said to originated from the anklet of Tirumal or Visnu and hence the name of the spring. It is said that sitting in the madavi mandapa near the spring Ilangovadigal wrote one of the five mahakavyas in Tamil, viz., Cilappatikaram. Even today the place is very fertile with many trees and different flora and fauna, a standing testimony to the vivid description of the place’s natural beauty as found in Tirumurugattruppadaiof Nakkeerar.
Though the sthala is of ancient origin, the temple as in existence today was constructed only recently. From days of yore Vel has been worshipped as the moolavar or main deity. The idol of Lord Muruga in a standing posture has a single face and four hands with Valli and Teyvayanai on both sides. The Vel made up of stone is of special significance and is worshipped with a great veneration by devotees.
The sthala vriksha is a rose apple tree. The fruits of this tree ripen during Skanda Sashti festival. The temple that was in existence during Sangam period no longer existed in Arunagirinatha’s time. The recently constructed temple is considered as Pazhamutircolai and worshipped by the devotees. It is needless to say that it is one of the six abodes of Lord Muruga very extensively praised and described by Nakkeerar in Tirumurugatruppadai.
Arunagirinathar also reveres this shrine in his Tiruppukal. Arunagirinatha sang 16 Tiruppugzh psalms to Pazhamutircolai Muruga. Though one might be in possession of all types of wealth, if he wants to lead a healthy life bereft of any disease he should necessarily visit Pazhamutircolai. Arunagirinatha very emphatically says in the most unequivocal terms that Lord Muruga should come before him running to bless each and everyone with health and wealth as has been very clearly described in the Tiruppugazh psalm.
Not far from Palamutircholai south of Madurai is another of the Aaru Patai Vedukal, Tirupparankunram.
The great Tamil poet and saint Avvaiyar was tested by Muruga here.In an episode of Divine Play with Avvaiyar, one of the most famous devotees of Muruga, the Lord enacted the following drama. One day Avvaiyar became tired while traveling under the hot sun and sought refuge under the shadow of a fruit tree, hungry and thirsty, when a boy who sitting on the tree asked her whether she wanted fruits from the tree. When Avvaiyar told him that she did, the boy asked Avvaiyar whether she wanted roasted fruits or unroasted fruits. Avvaiyar who was a famous Tamil poet and incredibly knowledgeable litterateur scoffed silently at the very thought of the existence of a “roasted fruit” and decided that the boy didn’t have knowledge even about a fruit. However, tired as she was, she decided that she didn’t want to argue with the boy and asked him to pick unroasted fruits for her, which the boy then proceeded to do. Several fruits fell out of the tree and Avvaiyar picked them up,blowing on them to remove the sand. Smiling, the boy asked Avvaiyar if she was blowing on his “roasted fruits” to cool them down.
Avvaiyar was astonished as to how a small village cowboy could have played such an intelligent drama. Blowing on the fruit to remove the sand was indeed poetically comparable to an attempt to cool “roasted fruits”. Humbled by the immense poetic knowledge and clever wordplay of the boy, Avvaiyar begged the boy to reveal his true identity, unable to reconcile herself with the fact that a simple cowherd could have such profound thoughts. The boy then disappeared and in his place, Muruga appeared. Avvaiyar, stunned to find herself in Divine Company, bowed in obeisance and realising the infinite nature of knowledge, prayed to Muruga to bless her and continue bestowing his Infinite Grace on her to aid her virtually endless quest for knowledge.

The beautiful temple of Lord Muruga at Tiruttani crowns a single rock 700 feet above sea level. It is situated amidst a range of hills with a dramatic panoramic view. This sacred place is on the Madras-Bombay route, 13 kilomters from Arkonam and 84 kilometers from Madras.
Around this town are famous religious places such as Kancheepuram (Banares of the South) on the South, Sholingar and Vallimalai on the West, the popular and renowned pilgrimage centre, Tirupati (otherwise called Balaji) and Kalahasti (with its Vayu Lingam) on the North and Tiruvalangadu (of puranic fame) with Lord Nataraja on the East.
Greatness of Tirutanikai
Puranic Importance Of Lord Murugan’s six Padaiveedus, Tirutanikai ranks prominent as the crown jewel of our Lord. As its very name indicates, when we propitiate our Lord in this holy shrine, He blesses us with mental peace and bodily happiness. His righteous indignation towards the asuras for their cruelty is said to have been quelled and cooled at this place which is, therefore, known as Shantipuri (Abode of Peace). As the prayers and desires of the devotees who worship our Lord Tanikesan on this hill with unserving faith and intense devotion are fulfilled in no time, this hill is also called Chanikasalam.
When our Lord came to this hill after wedding Goddess Valli at Vallimalai, She implored Him to enlighten Her on the importance and greatness of this hill. In reply, our Lord said that if one worshipped Him with heart and soul for five consecutive days in this hill temple, that person would be blessed with all that is best in this life and hereafter.
In Treta Yuga, Lord Rama, after putting an end to Ravana, worshipped Lord Siva at Rameswaram, at whose request Rama came to Tiruttani and found perfect peace of mind by worshipping our Lord Subrahmanya here. In Dwapara Yuga, Arjuna got the blessings of our Lord here by offering prayers to Him on his way to the South for Teertha Yatra (pilgrimage to take sacred immersion). Lord Vishnu prayed to our Lord at this place and got back His powerful Cakra (sacred wheel), Shanku (sacred conch), which were forcibly seized from Him by Tarakasura, brother of Soorapadma.
Lord Brahma propitiated our Lord here at the holy spring (by the sides of the steps to the shrine) known as Brahmasonai after his imprisonment by our Lord for his failure to explain the Pranava (‘Om’ mantra) and got back his creative function of which he was deprived by our Lord due to his egotistic impudence in neglecting to worship Lord Subrahmanya on his way to Mount Kailasa to worship Lord Siva.
Lord Indra planted and reared in the pool known as Indrasonai adjoining this hill temple the rare plant known as Karunkuvalai, which gave three flowers a day and worshipped our Lord thrice daily with these flowers and , thus, got back the precious wealth of Deva Loka such as Sanghaneeti, Padmaneeti, Chintamani, etc seized by the asura titan.
Nanda Devi worshipped our Lord here on the bank of the Nandi River and got His peerless initiation to realize the unique relationship between the soul (jeevatma) and God (Paramatma), which is the quintessence of Saiva Siddhanta philosophy, the choicest product of the Dravidian intellect according the pioneering dravidologist Dr. G.V. Pope.
On worshipping our Lord at Thanikai, the king of snakes Vasuki got his bodily wounds healed, which had been caused during the churning process in the Milky Ocean to secure the Amrita (nectar of immortality) by the devas and asuras when the Mantotra Mountain was used as the churning base and the snake king Vasuki as the rope. Sage Agasthyar Muni (of Potikai Hill) worshipped our Lord at Tanikai when he was blessed with the rare divine gift of the ever-sweet peerless Tamil language, the beauty of which has been extolled by all the great saints and poets of Tamil Nadu.
Apart from the puranic greatness of Tirutanikai, Saint Arunagirinathar, the illustrious devotee of Lord Muruga who lived 600 years ago, praised this hill as the chosen place for worship by devas and the favorite abode of saints performing prolonged tapas (austerities). He also compared this hill to Sivaloka (Bhuloka) and as the very soul of the world. Saint Ramalinga Swamigal (Arutprakasa Vallalar), who lived 150 years ago, was invited to come here by our Lord of Tanikai (seated on this hill) Who appeared before our saint in the mirror of his puja room at Madras after which the sour-stirring arutpa songs flowed from his lips in chaste Tamil like a torrential stream.
Sri Muttuswami Deekshitar, who lived 200 years ago (one of the trinity of Karnatic music) had his inspiration in Tiruttani when our Lord (in the guise of an old man) met him on the steps and sweetened his tongue with the prasadam of this temple, which impelled him to sing his first song — of course — on Lord Murugan of Tanikai. Many a miraculous event takes place at this shrine from time to time by the grace of our Lord. Oh, how grand and glorious is our Lord Tanigesan on this sacred hill of ancient fame and name!
Specialities of Tiruttani
The sacred tanks of the shrines of our Lord are all known as Saravanapoikai (‘sacred pond of the reedy marsh’ where Lord Karttikeya was born). The tank at Tiruttani, which (unlike in other places) is at the very foot of the hill, is particularly renowned for its sacred water (teertham) having curative effect for ailments both bodily and mental, as it is rich in minerals such as sulfur, iron, etc. A bath in this holy tank refreshes the devotee and makes him hale and healthy to propitiate our Lord with faith and devotion.
At the lovely garden on the south side of this sacred hill amidst a thick cluster of shady trees and seven cool sprints, the Seven Rishis (who today form the Great Bear stellar constellation) are said to have worshipped Lord Muruga and the Sapta Kannikas (Seven Virgins) enshrined at this place in a tiny temple.
On the outskirts of the Tiruttani town, on both sides of the Nandi River, are the ancient temples of Lord Vijayaragama Swami, Arumuga Swami and Veerateeswarar, the latter two of which are more than a thousand years old. In the temple of Arumuga Swami, there is soorya puja every year for three days in March when the rising sun is said to worship our Lord by casting its rays upon the holy Feet of the deity on the first day, Breast on the second day and Head on the third day through a hold in the wall, which reveals the marvellous intellect of the architects of ancient days.
Besides the monthly Krittikais which attract a large number of devotees to this shrine, the two outstanding annual festivals are the Aadi Krittikai and the 31st of December New Year Step Festival.
Aadi Krittikai
Aadi Krittikai festival (in July-August) lasts for three days with Float Festival when lakhs and lakhs of devotees come to this holy place from far and near. The streets are thronged to the full. About one lakh and fifty thousand flower kavadis (which increase with each year) are offered to the deity. The sight of the devotees who carry them, uttering the sacred and inspiring “Haro Hara!” (Hallelujah) as they march and dance in long rows touches the very core of our hearts and makes us spellbound. One should see it to believe it.
December 31st Step Festival
When the old (Gregorian) year is rung out and the New Year sets in (ie at the stroke of midnight on December 31st each year), lakhs of devotees are present on the sacred Tanikai hill to have the darshan of their Lord. They come to Tiruttani to offer their heart-felt prayers to our Lord on that day and night to be blessed with peace and plenty during the New Year.
This festival came into vogue during the British Raj when the famous Vallimalai Swamigal persuaded his followers to offer their homage first to Lord Tanigesan, the giver of all good, and only then to their official bosses. On this day, numerous bhajana parties gather and ascend the hill, singing the melodious Tiruppugazh songs and burning camphor on each of the hill’s 365 steps, one for each day of the New Year.
The entire atmosphere is filled with the music of these devotional songs, which is a feast to the eyes and ears. The sight of the Vel Kavadi taken to the shrine by some devotees on this day with the thin, sharp ends pricked and pierced all over the body above the hip (in spite of which they carry it with ease and grace) inspires and elevates our thoughts to adore our Lord for His mighty, marvellous and miraculous powers.

The temple is located on a hill named Thanigai hill reached with 60 steps. The temple has a five-tiered gopuram and four precincts. There are several water bodies associated with the temple. The temple has two shrines, namely, Murugan in the form of Shaktidharar and the shrines of Valli and Deivayanai in two other shrines.
Legend also has it that Indra the king of the Gods gave his daughter Deivayanai in marriage to Skanda, and along with her presented his elephant Airavatam as part of his dowry offering. Upon Airavatam’s departure Indra found his wealth waning. Subramanyar is said to have offered to return the white elephant, however Indra bound by protocol refused to accept a gift that he had made, and insisted that the elephant face his direction, hence the image of the elephant in this temple also faces the east.
Another legend has it that Indra presented a sandal stone as a part of his daughter’s dowry. The sandal paste made on this stone is applied to the image of Subramanya and the applied paste is said to acquire medicinal value. Legend also has it that Skanda bore the discus thrown by the demon Tarakasuran on his chest, and hence there is a hollow in the chest region of the image of Subramanya in this temple. Legend also has it that Skanda gifted the discus to Vishnu. Skanda is also believed to have imparted knowledge of Tamil to the sage Agasthyar and he is regarded as Veeramurthy, Gnanamurthy and Acharyamurthy in this shrine.
Lord Rama, after putting an end to Ravana, worshipped Lord Siva at Rameswaram and then came to Tiruttani to find perfect peace of mind by worshipping Lord Subrahmanya here. In Dwapara Yuga, Arjunagot the blessings by offering prayers to Him on his way to the South for Teertha Yatra (pilgrimage to take sacred immersion). Vishnu prayed to the Lord and got back his powerful Chakra (sacred wheel), Shanku (sacred conch), which were forcibly seized from him by Tarakasura, brother of Soorapadma. Lord Brahma propitiated the Lord here at the holy spring known as Brahmasonai after his imprisonment by our Lord for his failure to explain the Pranava (‘Om’ mantra) and got back his creative function of which he was deprived by our Lord due to his egotistic impudence in neglecting to worship Subrahmanya on his way to Mount Kailasa to worship Siva. The final steps to the eastern entrance.
On worshipping at Thanikai, the king of snakes Vasuki got his bodily wounds healed, which had been caused during the churning process in the Milky Ocean to secure the Amrita (nectar of immortality) by the devas and asuras when the Mantotra Mountain was used as the churning base and the snake king Vasuki as the rope. Sage Agasthyar Muni (of Potikai Hill) worshipped Muruga at Tanikai when he was blessed with the divine gift of the Tamil language.

Thanjavur District Tamil Nadu, India
 Swamimalai is a sylvan village, situated about five kilometers west of Kumbakonam on the banks of a tributary of river Cauvery. The temple is situated very close to the bus stand and the railway station is about two kilometers away. It is well connected to and surrounded by important places like Kumbakonam, Tiruvidaimarutur, Mayiladuthurai, Papanasam, Tanjavur etc.
Mythology and History
Mythology says that saint Bhrugu before commencing an arduous tavam or penance, got the boon that anybody disturbing his mediation will forget all his knowledge. Such was the power of the penance that the sacred fire emanating from the head of the saint reached up to the heavens, and the frightened devas surrendered to Lord Siva praying for his grace. The Lord extinguished the sacred fire by covering the saint’s head by hand. With the saint’s penance thus disturbed the Lord became oblivious of all his knowledge and is said to have regained them by learning the Pranava mantra from Lord Muruga at this shrine.
Once when Brahma, the lord of all creations was proceeding to Kailasa, the ever-playful child Lord Muruga asked him for the meaning of the Pranava OM. When Brahma admitted his ignorance, the Lord imprisoned him. With Brahma imprisoned, all creations came to a standstill and the devas prayed to Lord Siva to get Brahma released. When Muruga insisted that the imprisonment was a just punishment for the ignorance of Brahma, Lord Siva asked him whether he himself knew the meaning of the primordial Pranava OM. Lord Muruga said that he knew the meaning of OM and can expound it to the latter only if he can accept him as guru and listen to the exposition as a devoted disciple. As Lord Siva acceded to the request of Lord Muruga and heard the exposition of OM as a disciple, the place came to be known as Swamimalai and the presiding deity as Swaminathan.
The temple is built on an artificial hillock of about sixty feet height with sixty beautifully laid stone steps representing the Hindu cycle of sixty years – leading to the Lord . In the ground floor there are temples dedicated to Lord Sundareswarer and Goddesss Meenakshi.
Hymns in praise of the presiding deity have been sung by saint Nakkeerar in Tirumurukatrupadaiand by Saint Arunagirnathar in Tiruppukazh.
Daily pujas to the deities are performed six times a day (six kalams). Usha Kalam, Kalasandhi and Uchikala poojas are performed in the forenoon and the afternoon poojas commencing from Sayaratchai and Rendam kalam are concluded with Arthajama pooja in the night.
The important festivals conducted in the temple are:
Golden Chariot

Sub-temples
Among the sub-temples under the administration of the Swamimalai temple, the Sveta Vinayagar temple at Tiruvalanchuli is an important one. The presiding deity Lord Sadaimudinathar and Goddess Perianayaki have been sung by Tirugnanasambandar and Tirunavukkarasar in Tevaram. A unique feature of this temple is the Sveta Vinayagar or White Pillaiyar made of the sea foam formed at the time of churning of the Milky Ocean by the devas and asuras to get the nectar. The sacred Cauvery River flowing nearby herself has turned around in a right semicircle around this shrine and hence the name Valanchuli or right twist. Renovation of this temple at a cost of Rs. 50 Lakhs is progressing.
Another architecturally beautiful temple at Kilpazhayarai dedicated to Lord Somanathaswami is also under renovtion at an estimated cost of Rs. 50 Lakhs.

There is a legend how Lord Murugan came to this sacred spot. Narada Muni, a sage, brought a golden mango to the divine court of Lord Siva when Lord Siva was seated with his consort Parvati and His children Lord Vinayakar and Lord Subrahmanya. Narada gave the fruit to Lord Siva and implored Him to eat since it was a rare, miraculous Jñanapalam, the fruit of wisdom. As a loving husband, Lord Siva gave it to Parvati and requested her to eat. As a loving mother, she wanted to give the fruit to her children. As there was only one fruit and it should not be cut, they announced a contest and said that the winner would be given the fruit. Whoever completes one round of the globe first will be given the fruit.
Lord Subrahmanya mounted His peacock to go around the world. Lord Vinayakar circumambulated around His parents, symbolising the world, and got the fruit. On return, Lord Subrahmanya found that He was cheated. In anger, He renounced His family and came to this spot to settle forever. Lord Siva and Parvati came to pacify Him. They said, “Pazham Nee” (‘You are the Fruit’). Hence the name Palani is a popular syncopation of the two words mentioned.
The presiding deity, Lord Dandayudhapani Swami, is the son of Lord Siva and son-in-law of Vishnu. He has other names such as Kulandaivelan, Balasubrahmanyan, Shanmukhan, Devasenapati, Swaminathan, Vallimanalan, Devayanaimanalan, Palaniandavar, Kuriñjiandavar, Arumugan, Jñana Pandita, Saravanan, Sevar Kodiyon, etc. Tamils, Keralites, Bengalis, Sri Lankans, Malaysians, Fijians, Africans, Australians and Americans to name a few come here to worship Lord Muruga. Thus Murugan worship cuts across provincial boundaries and national frontiers.
Cheaman Perumal, a ruler of Kerala, built the main temple perhaps in the 7th Century AD. The Nayaks built the Navaranga Mandapam which is a fascinating stone structure incorporated by four pillars and endowed with nine bays. The other portions of the temple have been built by the Pandiya kings, besides a number of local heads, religious groups and individual devotees.

 One of the six places of worship dedicated to Lord Muruga, the shore temple of Arulmigu Subramanya Swami at Tiruchendur has a unique significance as the culmination of the concept of Muruga. With its lofty tower of about 140 feet, it has a holy past dating back to 2,000 years, if not earlier. References are available in such texts as Purananooru, Silappadikaram, Tirumurugatrupadai, Adi Sankarar Sri Subramanya Bhjangam, Kanda Puranam, Tiruppukazh, Tiruchendur Pillai Tamil, etc.
As one of the foremost spiritual centres, the temple has been an attraction for Hindus for ages. In the Tirumurugatrupadai, a classic of the third century AD, six chosen spots in The Tamil soil were referred to by Nakkirar as of more than ordinary sanctity fo the worshipo of Lord Muruga, among which Tiruchendur is number two. This was the only temple of Lord Muruga located on the seashore. His shrines are always situated amid mountains and forests, for these regions are considered dear to Lord Murugan. The variance here is possibly due to Muruga’s divine mission to free the devas, and the vanquishing of evil in the form of Surapadma and his mighty hosts in Veera Mahendram, their mid-ocean fortress. The Tamils have ever since been celbrating the event as an annual festival during Skanda Sashti.
At this spot, Lord Muruga was said to have emcamped before and after vanquishing the asuras and worshipped Siva at the shrine Mayan had built for Him. The Kanda Madana Parvata, the red sandstone rock of this coast received its foundations. A lofty gopuram also rose beside it. A part of the cliff was bored into to form the holy sanctum of Subramaniam. The red sandy rock round about was further carved into, and the rolling hills of sand moved away to gain more space. The second and thrid praharas were then desinged and brought into being. The Pandya and the Chera, their vassals, improved the temple. Maharaja Marthandavarma of Travancore Samasthanam endowed the very first Udaya Marthanda Kattalai of each morning and others followed in the nine aradhanas of the day.
As time rolled on, the effect of the sea and its salt-laden air begain to tell upon the inferior sandstones used in the original construction. A noble sannyasin, Mauna Swami, immediately took up the renovation and was followed by two others, Kasi Swami and Arumuga Swami. The work continued during the course of 72 years. The sannyasins were wedded to poerty, but nevertheless funds poured in for the construction of a worthy temple to stand for all times. The temple was constructed anew in all its details and kumbhabhishekam was performed in 1941. The temple and its gopurams of nine floors are a landmark visible at sea for twelve miles.
Lord Muruga’s association with Tiruchendur is significant. Tiruchendur, a sacred and prosperous town of victory, was also known as Tiruchen-Chendiloor in the Tamil classics. The Vasanta Mandapam is a recent noble edifice standing on 120 columns and with a central porch. The Ananda Vilas Mandapam stands on a raised sandy promontory majestically overlooking the sea. It is a mandapam of 16 pillars worked in black granite. The Shanmukha Vilasam, a magnificent mandapam of intricate stone plinths and columns, is the frontal adjunct to the main temple. It houses an ornate mandapam of four pillars in the centre, and this touches the ceiling through its elaborately carved and majestic pillars and supports the entire Shanmukha Vilasam.
The main entrance of this temple opens into the first temple prahara known as Sivili Mandapam. It is a series of four long corridors running round the inner second prahara flanked on either side by familiar rows of columns of yalis. The Sivili Mandapam produces a fine effect of symmetry and randeur. There is a Vishnu shrine of Lord Venkatesa on the norther prahara. Shrines to Vishnu withing ancient Saivite temples are common in South India as in Chidambaram, Rameswaram, Perur, Tiruchengode, Sikkil, etc. This Vishnu shrine is hollowed out of the rock itself.
The principal sanctum of this great temple is Subramaniam, the Lord of Senthil. The figure is seen in a standing posture. The principal sanctum has all the full complement of mandapas. The temple Mela Gopuram, a massive structure of nine storeys, is a striking landmark. The stupas at the top are nine in number in consonance with thenumber of storeys as a general rule with such temples. This gopuram is said to have been constructed 350 years ago by Desikamoorthy Swami of the Tiruvaduthurai Math. It is remarkable that from the sixth storey upwards to the ninth, the plaster on the walls is preserved and is beautified with fresco paintings.
According to Mr. C. Subramaniam, an art lover and managing trustee of Muthu Vadivammal Trust, there are four lithic inscriptions of the Pandya times collected together and planted in a line. Two of them belong to Pandya Varaguna Maran of about 875 AD, the third of Pandya Mara Varman of about 1282 AD and the fourth of Vikrama Pandya Deva. The inscriptions of Varaguna speak of his grant of 1,400 gold coins to the temple. There is a mention of a shrine to Nakkira Deva, which speaks highly of the literary advancement of the period.
A little removed from the main shrine and on the northern seashore under a cliff of overhanging hardened sandstone there is a picturesque cave carved out of it, which is famous as Valli’s Cave. Two images are installed there, one dedicated to Valli and another to Dattatreya. The king of a clan of hunters and his men had followed the flight of Valli with Muruga, and here they were confronted by the divine consorts who showered their grace upon the pursuers. The frontal shrine has been embellished by a stone mandapam, the walls of which have paintings of Nambi Rajan.
Almost embedded in a rolling high sand dune on the beach lies a remarkable spring known as Skanda Pushparani — the Nazhik Kinaru. It is a natural phenomenon and is said to have sprung up as Lord Shanmukha planted His lance — the Vel — on the spot.
There is a remarkable spring of fresh crystal water in a stone receptacle known as Nazhik Kinaru. It is a foot square and inset with the larger well. Another water source is one of saltish and highly sulphurous smelling and muddy-looking water. This swells up during the day and is pumped out daily so as not to allow it to overflow into the smaller one. A bath in the sea and in this well is considered to be of much spiritual merit.
Except for the sanctum and mahamandapam, the entire temple structure is of recent origin according to researchers.
The utsavar idols of Lord Muruga, with consorts worshipped by Kattabomman are kept at the first prahara in the northern side, which is characteristic of temple iconography of the 19th century. It is said that Kattabomman used to hear the bell sound after the puja was over at the temple by way of a chain of mandapams built along a distance of about 50 miles to his royal seat at Panchalankurichi.
The kumbhabhishekam of the temple, performed once in twelve years, is slated for 5 July 1995 and the temple is being given a facelift. According to Mr. Uvari A. Kirubanidhi, Chairman of the Trustees’ Board of the Temple, renovation work costing more than Rs. one crore are under progress. He said that a new dhyana mandapam has been constructed with an outlay of Rs.10 lakkhs adjacent to Valli’s Cave. Mr. Kirubanidhi said the temple management has set up a power station to augment the power supply in the town by spending Rs.25 lakh. The beach will be illuminated by installing neon lights and it has been proposed to construct a big choultry in a three-phased manner at an outlay of Rs. 84 lakhs to accommodate the devotees free of cost. Every day 40,000 devotees visit the temple.

Tirupparankundram is situated three miles southeast of Madurai on the main railway line. It is one of the Aru Padai Veedugal or six sacred places selected by Lord Subrahmanya for his abode. The importance of this temple is that here was celebrated the marriage of Lord Subrahmanya with the daughter of Indra, Devayanai.
Long, long ago, when Lord Subrahmanya was staying at Kanda Verpu, the two daughters of Lord Maha Vishnu, Amrita Valli and Sundara Valli, cherished the desire of becoming the consorts of Subrahmanya. With this aim in mind they both went to Saravana Poigai and commenced austere penance to fulfil their desires.
Pleased with their prayer and worship, Lord Subrahmanya appeared before them and told Amrita Valli, “You will be brought up by Indra as his daughter and I shall marry you in due course.” Her younger sister Sundara Valli was also graced with a similar blessing. She was born to sage Sivamuni and brought up by Nambi, the headman of Veddas.
Amrita Valli took the form of a female child and went to Mount Meru, the abode of Indra, and told him, “I am the daughter of Maha Vishnu and the responsibility of looking after me has been entrusted to you.” On hearing this, Indra became very happy and directed Airavatam, his white elephant, to take care of the child.
The elephant with all love brought her up and affection and she attained the age of marriage in course of time. Hence she came to be known as Devayanai, one who was brought up by the heavenly elephant of Indra (yānai in Tamil means elephant).
The six sons of sage Parasara were cursed to become fishes in the Saravana Poigai. On request for redemption, these six boys were ordered to pray to Lord Subrahmanya.
When they got his darshan, they could get redemption. It was also made known to them that Lord Subrahmanya would come to Tirupparankunram after vanquishing the demon Surapadma. Anxiously they waited for the arrival of Subrahmanya.
When the mission of Subrahmanva to vanquish Surapadma was over at Tiruchendur, on his way, he came to this spot followed by all the devas and heavenly beings whom he had released from the untold miseries caused by Surapadma.
On his arrival at Tirupparankunram, the sons of Parasara received Subrahmanya and, at their request, he consented to stay there. He at once ordered Viswakarma to construct a beautiful abode for himself, for the devas and for others.
He also suggested to the heavenly architect to build roads and erect a city around them. Indra, the king of the angels, desired to get his daughter Devayanai married to Subrahmanya, as a mark of his gratitude for relieving him and the devas from the depredations of the demon Surapadma.
He expressed his desire to Brahma and Vishnu who were present there. They were only too glad to hear the proposal. When they communicated the desire of Indra to Lord Subrahmanya he readily agreed to it and said: “Devayanai has been praying at Saravana Poigai in the Himalayas for this happy marriage. Now the time has come for its being solemnised.” As Subrahmanya agreed to this marriage, Indra sent a messenger to bring his wife Indrani and daughter Devayanai from Mout Meru.
The marriage took place at Tirupparankunram, after the victory of Subrahmanya over Surapadma. All arrangements for marriage were made and the marriage was performed at the Tirupparankunram Temple. All the devas, Siva and Parvati attended the marriage and blessed Subrahmanya and Devayanai. Since then, the temple has become a very famous abode of Subrahmanya.

Hence Kurinji flower and a temple for Muruga exists in Kodaikanal. The temple was built in 1936 by the Australian wife of Ponnambalam (Ceylonese) considered to be the father of the Ceylonese. It is 5 km from the Kodaikanal Lake dug in 1863, and in 1971 was taken over by the Palani Devasthanam.
A small peacock Mandapa in front, a tin shed becoming a Maha Mandapa a pillar with a bell atop, a sanctum without a gopura is that all is in the temple. It can be seen from the Palani Hills. The flower show of Kurinji Andavar takes place annually. Fortunately Kodai Hills has not yet lost the charms of rustic beauty.

This shrine is located in a peaceful natural setting. The puranas speak of it as ‘Kannikara Vanam’. Perhaps that is the reson the Sapta Kannis and Karuppanna Swami keep watch over this places. It is said that this temple was built about a thousand years ago. the first consecration was held in 1915 and then a second time in 1962.
The niche of Brahma in the north corridor is within the walls of the inner sanctum. The Chandisa cell is towards the east. then comes the Vishnu cell in the sanctum wall.
Here one has to pause and think. It is cusomary to erect the Chandisa cell in the northeast, when the main deity faces east. Here the main God looks west and the main entrance looks to the south. Strictly speaking the Chandisa cell should be in south west or south east. But here it is in the northeast and farther in contrast to the rule that no other cell should be in a line with this, the cell of Tirumal and three others are found. About 150 years ago, certain repairs were carried out in this temple, when some cells were newly build, that of Chandisa was left untouched.
To the north of Chandisa is the Navagraha dais with iron bars all round. Then we pass in to Dakshinamurthi and Nataraja. It is very easy to fix the directions by a look at these images. Both will always look to the south.

The temple is quite big and build in the south Indian architectural pattern. There are many mini shrines for Saivate Gods, like Muthukumaraswamy, Nataraja, Vinayaka etc.
The Mother’s temple is on the southern side of the Murugan, and the Kailasanatha temple is on the northern side. Close observation reveals that it was originally built for Muruga, and later the Mother’s sheine and Kailasanatha shrine were added. So the Murugan koil is buffered by the shrine of his parents. Furthermore the flog staff and Mayura, the mount of Muruga are in frount of Murugan shrine. Any way, this method of Murugan seated in the centre with parents to his right and left is called Somaskanda Moorthi.
All the three temples are lavishly adorned with filigree work of supreme artistry. The ace sculptural craft man ship reflecting the refined taste of the builders and the sculptors elevate the souls. This spacious temple besides housing the three most adorable deities is also serving as an art gallery, since all the Vahanas made in wood, silver and iron of several shrines under the temple management are kept there. Their shapes, sizes and superb craft man ship offer a royal banquet to the eyes.

The sanctum is very small. In the south west corner of Arda Mandapa is one with a baby. She is Peichi Aththal.
“In Chakravala Katta, of Paher ther is a Pei (ghost) called Idahini. It will kidnap babies. To counteract that one should observe a vow called Padukidathal.”
The above is apassage from Cilappadikaram, Manimekalai, etc. that ghost Idahini is in the form of Peyichi aththal. Those who observe a vow here throw salt on the head of Peichi amman as a symbol of their having renounced salt due to the vow. But Peichi too knows fully well that these devotees after eating well in their house, purchase salt from tha bazar and throw it on her head! But this too is tolerable, some do not even buy salt in the shop. Salt is heaped at the feet of Peichi and these people take that in their hands and throw it! Peichi is aware of that too!
Some important persons are always paying a visit to this shrine, and hence the priest is often coming out peering to see if that man has arrived. With the priest obstructing the views of the Goddess it is very difficult to have a darshan of Mariamman. We hope atleast she has seen us.
The seated Mariamman is small in stature. She is covered with a golden sheath, and on Fridays there will always be a crowd. This too is owned by the Devasthanam.

This has a long legend and takes us to the time of Agasthya’s penance here. The great Saga drawn by the sequestered sublimity of this region chose it for penance during his southern trip. After completing it satisfactorily, he dedicated to move further south words. Realizing the sanctity and sublimity hovering over these two hills, he then bade his mighty demon assistant to carry them popularly known as Sivagiri and Sakthigiri tying them onto a Kavadi. He obeyed.
While on the move, the Sakthigiri was seen going up into the air and so placed some heavy stones to equalize the weight, yet it was floating in the air stopping, he closely observed the Sivagiri hill to know its might. Them found he, a small boy sitting on the Sivagiri hill and presumed rightly that he was the cause for it. He at once ordered the tiny tot to go out of the hill.
There was exchange of harsh words, followed by fisticuffs. Alas! Idumban was floored and killed on the spot. At the instant of Agasthya Mahrishi, Murugan breathed a fresh lease of life, In addition the omni passionate Muruga took him into his service as Dwarapalaka at the latter’s humble request, besides ordering first worship to him everyday. This tradition is being carried on since then.
Realizing the supreme spiritual significance of this the Devasthanam authority purchased it from the Forest department and built a fitting temple it is provided with a flight of 551 steps for easy Mounding. It lies only a kilometer off Sivagiri hill. A most – worthy place

Just behind the temple of Avinankudi, there are two rows of six stucco niches. Let us go there. Paintings of Muruga being tended by six Karthikai maidens attract us. Here too we have to pay a fee and get in.
It is not a pool but only a deep well. It must have been a tank once. A square wall has been erected. In the south is the bathing ghats. Several steps are submerged in the water. People in the past got down through these steps and bathed. Now as that is not possible, the water is very clean. Coins have been strewn into the water. This is an old custom and persists. When people who travel by train cross the bridge of any sacred river, they throw coins into it, thinking it is a holy act.
In the south-east is the Kshatrice Chaurav madam, and in the south is a Vinayaga temple. Wherever there is a tank invariably there will be a Pilliar Koil on the bank and here where his brother Muruga happens to reside the elder brother is sure to abide. In the west side of the ghats is a tub like structure half filled with water and Deity.
Dhandapani stands in the middle. We can bathe him by our hands with the water around him. In the sanctum we can not enter and perform ablutions. But here there are no such restrictions.

Bhogar is a well known Siddhar who made the idol of Lord Muruga at the hill temple. His guru is Kalanginaathar believed to be a Chinese and his disciple is Pulippani siddhar (whose Samadhi is in Thirupattur near Trichy covered in my Blog). Bhogar is an expert in siddha medicine and it is said that as per the last wishes of his guru, Bhogar proceeded to China to spread the knowledge of siddha sciences. His journey is said to have been made with the aid of an aircraft; he demonstrated to the Chinese the details of the construction of the aircraft and later built for them a sea-going craft using a steam engine. The details of these and other experiments demonstrated by Bhogar in China are clearly documented in the Saptakanda.
Bogar, as an expert in siddha medicine and with the consultation of Agasthiar (Father of Ayurvedic Medicine) and other siddhars, used 4448 rare herbs to make 9 poisonous medicines or Nava Bhashanam (Nava means nine; Bhashanam means poison). Out of this Nava Bhashanam, he then made one Master Medicine that can cure all diseases in a solid stone like form as Lord Murugan which is currently being worshiped as the main deity. Thirumoolar also discusses one such Master Medicine in his book Thirumandhiram. When the abhisheha items like milk and Panchamirtham flows on the deity from top to bottom the medicinal power is extracted in them. After installing, Bogar used to worship the idol and later after him, his disciple took over. Pulippani Siddhar and his descendants maintained this almost as their personal and private temple. Bogar went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi – the highest samadhi stage; where the Mind dissolves with Matter and Energy.
Bogar Samadhi is inside the hill temple, south west of the sanctum sanctorum in a narrow cave like corridor. It is believed that there is an underground passage here that goes straight to the foot of the main deity, Lord Murugan. Actually Bogar himself constructed this and went into Nirvigalpa Samadhi here. He is last seen by his disciples at this entrance.

Hindu Agama Shastras compare a Temple to the human body. Just as an individual soul is enveloped by five košas or sheaths – (Annamova, Prãnamaya, Manomaya, Vynãnamaya and Ãnandamaya) – the Deity installed in the Temple (representing the Supreme Spirit) is also enveloped by five prãkaras
Just as our gross body has five sections – head, neck, chest, legs and feet – a Temple also has five corresponding sections. The Garbhagriham or sanctum Santorum represents the head; the Sanctum is the Soul or the Jiva of the body; the Vimana over the Sanctum represents the tip of the nose. Ardhamandap in front of the Sanctum represents the neck; Mahã Mandapam, the chest; Prakaras around the Sanctum represents our five senses: the palibida where nivedana is offered to the deity represents the naval; the kodimaram represents the jeevadhara; and the Gopura, the main gateway of the temple, represents the feet.
TEMPLE AND HUMAN BODY
The main parts of a temple are:
1. Garbhagraha (Sanctum Sanctorum) containing the image of God.
2. The Vimana over the Sanctum.
3. Ardhamandap in front of the Sanctum.
4. Prakaras around the Sanctum.
5. The Gopura, the main gateway of the temple.
Indian temple is only a reflection of the physical form of the human body. According to the Tirumular “our body is a temple”. According to the Kathopanishad “This body of ours is a temple of the Divine.”

In the widened east street, the emerald green of fields and the cool blue of the Kodai hills is very exhilarating . The very name “Kodai hills” carries a special significance. There was a time when people were afraid to come to Kodaikanal. Muruga was in a fix with no money even for an ordinary festival. Pandarams carried him on their sholders, visiting many places and requesting monery for festivals.
Even then when people did not come to him, he went in search of them. In riches je might have been a begger but in mercy and grace never – why were people afraid to come here? The hill would have been a forest. There would have been no steps. Devotees woild have worshipped at Thiru Avinankudi and gone. That is why literatures and insceiptions speak less of the hill temple. Only in leter daus when Boga, Pulipani and Arunagiri Nathar visited the hill, people got courage and began visiting it.
Today the scene os dofferent. Lights illumine the hill as daylight. In the east and west mercury lights pour lightr in each and everything.
Becouse Karthigai maids reared him, he got the name Karthikeyan. Karthigai day is very holy on this account. This day comes for 13 days in an year. To condact the festivities in that period, this Kartigai mandapan was constructed bu Annur Govindasami Naidu in 1978. This mandapa has occupoed half of east street. Stucco nitches adorn the west wall. In the north is Idumban painting.

Valli spring is on overflow from a mountain-spring. It collects itself in a depression and forms a tank. It is frnced by iron bars and one is not allowed to get into it. They can sprinkle water on their heads. Two Nagas stones are at the edge and the water is used to perform ablutions to the Nagas. By investing little they hope to reap a big harvest from dandapani.
valli is under a tree surrounded by Naga stones. When she guarded the ragi fields “once she stood in the hot sun. Why should she be subjected to such hardship again”, thought the Devasthanm and they inntend to provide her a roof.
To her left on a dais abutting the hill 35 images are housed in a row under the open sky. It looks kike an army parade. Devotees press coins on their body! That is why beggars are not alloewed here. Beggars give the petty coins they received as alms to us and receive rupees. We stick these coins on the images. Of course the beggars charge some commission for this transaction.

Headaches of people will vanish Further it guards against head-aches.
Muruga himself is a physician. His very body is a medicine. Moreover to go round the hills is a tonic. The various herbal plants grown by the Siddars are still there. The air coming over them cures ills. It is the same in Kodai hills also.
People go round the hills in all times and in all seasons. During festivals the number will swell. Generally the best time go round the hills is early morning. The air called Ozone will rise in dawn and disappear at sunrise. This air is very beneficial to us. During the hot Agni Nakshatram days, devotes will go round from 1 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 10 p.m.. This is the period when Kadamba and kora, favourite trees of Muruga will blossom and waft their fragrance. These trees too have curative properties. Some devotees even roll round the hill (Angapradakshinam).
The Kora tree is the holy tree in Thiruvidaikazhi, a Muruga Sthala. This place should be approached from Thirukadavur near Mayuram. In Thiruvannamalai, it is difficult to go round the hills.

He is receiving our attention long before his brother. The number of Vinayagar temples in Palani is the greatest than in any other place. Somaley has reported that ther are 108 Vinayaga temples in Palani. Perhaps Vinayaga in grreat numbers have assembled here to shower grace on devotees who come to worship his brother.
Further there are many varieties of Vinayagars too here. They built a new Vinayaga shrine in Shanmugapuram colony. The Tamil Literary Society is looking after that. He has been bestowing grace on all, who come to him. The roof of the Patha Vinayagar temple is very low. In a way it does not affect any devotee, as bowing with head bent is common in all Vinayaga Temples.
The Vinayagar sports in his upper hands Ankusa in the right and Pasa (noose) in the left. Ankusa is an instrument used tocontrol an elephant. Why this elephant is wielding that weapon? He has to control himself as nobody else can control him. The object of bowing down and thumbing our forehead ourselves is indicative of the truth that one should control himself; instead of offering ourselves to be controlled by others.

The temple is open from 6.00 a.m. to 12.00 a.m. and from 4.00 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.
The primary temple was modeled upon the Puri Jagannath temple, whereas the outside structure reflects Pandava architecture. The temple follows both the Orthodox Sampradaya (tradition) of the South and the Bhajan Sampradaya of the North.

This temple is dedicated to Lord Panduranga i.e. Lord Vishnu along with His consort Raghumayee. The Deity of Lord Pandurangan is made of Shaligrama and twelve feet in height. Lord Pandurangan adorns the alankara of the Madura King on sundays, a very simple alankara on thursdays where His divine feet can be seen, alankara with silver kavacha and ornaments on fridays and in the form of Lord Venkateswara on saturdays.
    
The structure of the temple resembles the Pandaripuram temple in Maharashtra with Lord Panduranga accompanied by Mother Ragumayee blessing devotees. The temple was built by the disciple of His Holiness Gnanananda Swamigal, His Holiness Haridas Giri Swamigal.  It is being administered by His Holiness Namanandagiri Swamigal presently. Lord Panduranga is majestically 12 feet tall made of Salagrama stone. He graces in a standing posture. Raghumayee nearby is adding beauty to beauty. Nearby, an idol of Lord Varadharaja and his consorts may be seen.
Another rare element of this temple is the presence of a historical idol of Achutharaya Perumal, which was brought from Tirumala Tirupathi. Along with these idols, the golden idols worshiped by Swami Haridas Giri are present here. Lord Panduranga showers his blessing as a King of Mathura on Sundays, in a simple form showing his Lotus feet for the darshan of devotees on Thursdays, with silver coverings on Fridays & as Lord Venkatachalapathi on Saturdays.

https://www.bharattemples.com/sarangapani-temple-kumbakonam/,"This is one of the 108 Divya Desams located on the banks of the sacred river Kaveri. The temple also has the distinction of being a Pancharanga Kshetra. The temple tank is called Potramarai and located opposite the western entrance.
The 2000 year old Sarangapani Aaravamudhan temple is housed between two rivers, Cauvery and Arasalaaru, in the heart of Kumbakonam, once the capital of the Chola Kingdom.
It is said that Sage Hema Rishi had performed penances on the bank of the temple tank ‘Potramarai’ to get Lakshmi Devi as his daughter. Being pleased by the penances, Lord Vishnu appeared and blessed the Sage with the boon of getting Lakshmi Devi as his daughter. Lakshmi Devi manifested on a lotus flower in the Potramarai tank and hence was called Komalavalli.

Some parts of the temple is believed to have been built in the 7th Century AD by the famous Pallava King Mahendra Varma but the real construction of the temple is said to have been done by the Cholas and later renovated by the famous Vijayanagara King Krishnadevaraya.
Sarangapani Temple had a devotee called Lakshmi Narayanaswami. During his lifetime he was engaged in the Nityakainkarya (daily rituals) of the temple. With the help of kings and the wealthy people in the kingdom, he was able to procure ornaments for the deities and landed properties for the temple. He also built the Rajagopuram (main tower) and other mandapams inside the temple complex. When the devotee passed away on a Deepavali (Diwali) day with no heirs, the Lord himself is supposed to have performed the devotee’s funeral rites. Since then, on every Deepavali day, shraadam (death rites) is performed to Sri Lakshmi Narayanaswami on behalf of the Lord in the temple.

The Sarangapani Temple existed during the Pallava period. However, the current structure is attributed to the period of Vikrama Chola (1121 CE onwards). Later, the Cholas built the superstructure of the 11-tiered gopuram but the tower was actually completed by the Vijayanagara rulers.

As per Hindu legend, Sage Brigu came to Vaikunda to test the patience and tolerance quality of Lord Vishnu by hitting on his chest.  Lord did not prevent the sage nor grew angry against him. But Lord simply smiled.  Mother Lakshmi asked the Lord how he could allow other male to touch her also while hitting him as the chest of Lord is her home.  The sage fell at the feet of Mother Lakshmi and said that he was given the job of finding a God so soft in nature for conducting a Yagna to whom it was to be dedicated.  I hit Lord for this test and meant no motives.  He also begged Mother that she should be born his daughter.
Mother Lakshmi happily blessed the sage.  She promised the sage to leave Lord for him and advised him to take on penance to realize his wish.   The sage performed penance in Kumbakonam and found Mother on the Hema Pushkarani Theertha on a Lotus.  He took the child and named her Komalavalli.  Vishnu descended to earth as Aaravamudhan in a chariot drawn by horses and elephants from his abode Vaikuntam. He stayed in the nearby Someswaran Temple to woo Lakshmi to marry him and the couple eventually got married. The name Sarangapani (“one who has the bow in his hand”) derives from the Tamil word Sarangam meaning bow of Vishnu and pani meaning hand. He gave his daughter to Perumal in a grand wedding.  Perumal came to wed Mother holding a bow-Sarnga, hence is praised as Lord Sarangapani.  The place thus is revered as the Avatara Sthala-birth place of Mother Komalavalli-Lakshmi.
Sarangapani Temple’s Vaideeka Vimanam (special style of dome over sanctum) is considered to be an offshoot of the Srirangam Pranava Vimanam, which is a replica of the Pushpaka Vimanam (flying chariot from the Ramayana) presented to Vibishana of Sri Lanka by Rama after the ten-headed Ravana was killed. The main temple has a beautiful mandapam (hall) in front of the temple. Click to read complete Sarangapani Temple Architecture

It is one of the 108 holy vishnavite temples. Vaduvur Sri Kailasanathar swamy temple is one of the famous temple in vaduvur and also it is one of west facing lord Siva temple.and the famous AASAI temple in vaduvur Vadapathi.
This ancient temple is dedicated to Lord Rama along with Sita Devi, Lakshman Dev and Hanuman. The Deities here are swayambhu i.e. self manifested with the exception of Lakshmana whose original Deity is worshiped along with Bharata in a different temple as Rama and Lakshmana.
It is said that Lord Rama stayed at an ashrama of Sages when returning to Ayodhya after killing Ravana. The Sages had requested Him to stay there forever which couldn’t be fulfilled due to His duties as a King. Lord Rama instead ordered Lord Vishwakarma, the celestial architect to sculpt His Deity and leave it outside the ashram. The Sages were spellbound by the divine beauty and requested that the Deities be left behind to which Lord Rama readily agreed. Later, Lord Rama is said to have appeared in the dream of the ruler of Thanjavur in the 18th century and ordered the King to unearth the Deities at Thalai Gnayiru(Thalanayar in Nagapattinam dt, TN) under the arasa maram or sacred fig tree. The Deities were found but the villagers came to know about this and thus prevented the King from taking the Deities away.
The King convinced the villagers and thus left the Deities of Lakshmana and Bharata with them. On the way back, the King and his entourage rested at Vaduvur village where the villagers there also got to know about the Deities and so, wanted to have Them installed in Vaduvur. They had threatened to commit suicide by jumping from the village temple roof if the Deities weren’t installed there. The King acceded to the demands of the villagers and so the Deities were installed in the Rukmini Satyabhama samedha Gopalan temple in Vaduvur. Till today, the worship of the Deities goes on there. The Deity of Lakshmana was sculpted by the villagers.
The temple has four titles awarded to it i.e. Abhimana Divya Desam of Lord Vishnu, Vagularanyam Kshetram, Bhaskara Kshetram and Dakshina Ayodhya.

Dedicated to Bhagwan Vishnu
The temple occupies an area of 155 acres (63 ha) with 50 shrines, 21 towers, 39 pavilions and many water tanks integrated into the complex.
Srirangam temple is often listed as the largest functioning Hindu temple in the world. The temple occupies an area of 156 acres (631,000 m²) with a perimeter of 4,116m (10,710 feet) making it the largest temple in India and one of the largest religious complexes in the world. The temple is enclosed by 7 concentric walls (termed prakarams (outer courtyard) or mathil suvar) with a total length of 32,592 feet or over six miles. These temple has 21 gopurams (towers), 39 pavilions, fifty shrines, Ayiram kaal mandapam (a hall of 1000 pillars) and several small water bodies inside. The space within the outer two prakarams (outer courtyard) is occupied by several shops, restaurants and flower stalls. The Hall of 1000 pillars (actually 953) is a fine example of a planned theatre-like structure and opposite to it, “Sesha Mandap”, with its intricacy in sculpture, is a delight.The 1000-pillared hall made of granite was constructed in the Vijayanagara period (1336–1565) on the site of the old temple.
The temple site is on a large island bounded by the Cauvery River and Kollidam River. Its location has rendered it vulnerable to natural disasters as well as the rampaging of invading armies – Muslim and European – which repeatedly commandeered the site for military encampment.
The annual 21 day festival conducted during the Tamil month of Margazhi (December–January) attracts 1 million visitors.
 
 
Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, and It is one of the most illustrious Vaishnava temples in South India rich in legend and history.
 
The main entrance, known as the Rajagopuram (the royal temple tower), rises from the base area of around 5720 and goes up to 237 feet (72 m), moving up in eleven progressively smaller tiers.

The pillars consists of sculptures of wildly rearing horses bearing riders on their backs and trampling with their hoofs upon the heads of rampant tigers, seem only natural and congruous among such weird surroundings.
 
Sriranga Mahathmiyam, for example, is one of the compilation of the temple mythology about its origins. According to it, Brahma was performing austerities during the samudra manthan (churning of cosmic ocean), and Srirangam Vimanam emerged as a result. When Vibhishana passed through Trichy en route to Sri Lanka where he had become the king, the Srirangam Vimanam would not move from the island. So he gave it to a local king called Dharma Varma if the king consecrated the Vimanam to face the south cardinal direction eternally, blessing him and Lanka. Hence it is that the deity (in a reclining posture) faces South, his body aligned to the east-west axis.
