        <p>Hidimba Devi Temple Kullu Himachal Pradesh Hidimba Devi Temple locally known as Dhungiri Temple also known variously as the Hadimba Temple is located in Man?li a hill station in the State of Him?chal Pradesh in north India. It is an ancient cave temple dedicated to Hidimbi Devi wife of Bhima a figure in the Indian epic Mah?bh?rata. The temple is surrounded by a cedar forest called Dhungiri Van Vihar at the foot of the Him?layas. The sanctuary is built over a huge rock jutting out of the ground which was worshiped as an image of the deity. The structure was built in 1553 he Hidimba Devi Temple has intricately carved wooden doors and a 24 meters tall wooden shikhar or tower above the sanctuary.The tower consists of three square roofs covered with timber tiles and a fourth brass cone-shaped roof at the top. The earth goddess Durga forms the theme of the main door carvings.Also depicted are animals foliate designs dancers scenes from Lord Krishna s life and Navagrahas.The temple base is made out of whitewashed mud-covered stonework. An enormous rock occupies the inside of the temple only a 7.5 cm 3 inch tall brass image representing goddess Hidimba Devi. A rope hangs down in front of the rock and according to a legend in bygone days religious zealots would tie the hands of sinners by the rope and then swing them against the rock. About seventy metres away from the temple there is a shrine dedicated to Goddess Hidimba s son Ghatotkacha who was born after she married Bhima. The most surprising feature of the temple or what believers could call the most reassuring feature of the temple is the fact that inside the temple the imprint of the feet of the Goddess carved on a block of stone are worshipped. The Hadimba devi temple was built in 1553 AD by Maharaja Bahadur Singh. The temple is built around a cave where Devi Hidimba performed meditation. Hidimbi was supposed to have lived there with her brother Hidimb and not much is known about their parents. Born into a Rakshasa family Hidimba vowed to marry one who would defeat her brother Hidimb who was supposed to be very brave and fearless. During the Pandava s exile when they visited Manali Bhima one of the five Pandavas killed Hidimb. Thereafter Hidimba married Bhima and gave birth to their son Ghatotkacha. Official Address</p>
