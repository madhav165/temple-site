In the month of Bhadon on the eighth day of the new moon period a fair is held in the precincts of the lake that attracts thousands of pilgrims. Manimahesh Kailash has not been successfully summitted by mountaineers and is thus remains a virgin peak. An attempt to climb the peak in 1968 by an Indo Japanese team led by Nandini Patel was aborted.
