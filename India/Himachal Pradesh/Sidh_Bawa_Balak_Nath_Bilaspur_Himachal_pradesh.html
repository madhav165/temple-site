        <p>Sidh Bawa Balak Nath Bilaspur Himachal pradesh Sidh Bawa Balak Nath also known as Paunahari or Dudhadhari is a Hindu deity known as the most gracious god in Hinduism. He is known as the incarnation of Lord Shiva in Kali Yuga. Sidh Bawa Balak Nath is known as the merciful one who forgives all the sins  god incarnated in Kali Yuga. He is the follower of Nath Sect. Baba Balak Nath or Sidh Baba Balak Nath is a Hindu deity worshipped in the northern Indian states of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. His shrine is known as Deotsidh . It is situated 45 kms. away from Hamirpur near the border of Hamirpur and Bilaspur districts of Himachal Pradesh India. The Baba Balak Nath Temple is situated at the village of Chakmoh in the district of Hamirpur on the hilltop in a natural cave carved in the hills considered to be the abode of Baba. An Idol of Baba is placed in the cave.  The most popular story about the birth of Baba Balak Nath as sidh-purush is associated with the Amar Katha of Lord Shiva. It is said that Lord Shiva was sharing the Amar Katha with Goddess Parvati in the cave of Amarnath and Goddess Parvati fell asleep. A kid-parrot was there in the cave and he was listening the entire story and was making noise of yes  hmm.. . When the story finished Lord Shiva found Goddess Parwati sleeping and so he understood that someone else had heard the story. He became very angry and threw his Trishul on the kid-parrot. The kid-parrot escaped from there to save his life and Trishul followed him. In the way the wife of Rishi Vyasa was yawning. The kid-parrot entered her stomach through her mouth. The Trishul stopped as it was unreligious to kill a lady. When Lord Shiva knew all this he also came there and narrated his problem to Rishi Vyas. Rishi Vyas told him that he should wait there and as the kid-parrot would come out he could kill him. Lord Shiva stood there for a very long time but the kid-parrot did not come out. As Lord Shiva stood there the whole universe got disordered. Then all the Lords met Sage Narada and requested him to request Lord Shiva to save the world. Then Narada came to Lord Shiva and prayed him to leave his anger as the child had already heard the Amar Katha.and so now he had become immortal and now nobody could kill him. Listening to this Lord Shiva told the kid-parrot to come out and in return the kid-parrot demanded a blessing from him. Lord Shiva accepted that and the kid-parrot prayed that as he comes out as a man any other child who gets birth at the same time would be granted all kind of knowledge and would be immortal. As Lord Shiva accepted this a divine baby come out from the mouth of Rishi Vyas. He prayed Lord Shiva and got his blessings. This divine baby was called Sukhdev Muni later. The other babies who got birth at that time were famous as Navnatha and eighty-four siddhas Chaurasi Sidh . One of them was Baba Balak Nath. Connection with Lord Shiva in Dwapara Yuga  It is believed about Baba Balak Nath that he takes birth in every age yug . He appeared as Skanda in Satya Yuga as Kaul in Treta and as Mahakaul in Dwapara. In Dwapar age Baba Balak Nath was in the way to Kailash Dham with a wish to meet Lord Shiva. In the way he met with an old lady. The lady asked him where he is going. Then Baba Balak Nath who was Mahakaul told her that he is praying Lord Shiva since last three births but he had not been blessed by Lord Shiva with his appearance and so he was moving towards Kailash Dham with this very wish. The old lady told Baba that it was not easy to have a live appearance of Lord Shiva. You have to do something extraordinary. When Baba asked her what he should do she told that Baba should stand in the foothills of the Kailash near Mansarovar and pray there. Mata Parwati used to come there on some occasions for bath. When Mata Parwati comes there he should pray her to fulfill her wish. Mata Parwati will surely try to give him something else but he should insist on his wish only. Baba Balak Nath stood for twelve gharis with the old lady and moved towards the Man Sarovar. He did the same as the old lady had advised him and finally Lord Shiva was pleased and blessed him to be Paramsidh in Kaliyug that he would remain as Balak young and age would not affect him. MahaKaul of Dwapar age got birth in Kaliyug at Kathiyawad in the house of Narayan Vishnu and Laxmi. Parent named him as Dev . Dev was very religious from his childhood and he used to pray all the times. His parents then tried to marry him so that he cannot leave the home. Dev was not ready for this. When he was so much under pressure for marriage he left home and moved towards Girnar Parwat in the search of Paramsiddhi. In Junagarh he met with Swami Dattatreya. Here at the ashram of Swami Dattatreya he got divine knowledge and emerged as Sidh. As Lord Shiva had blessed him that age will not affect him he remained as a child and called Balak Nath .
