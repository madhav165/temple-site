There is a self appearing Sivalingam here the actual age of which is unknown. But during the reign of Govind Singh Jamindar of Jharsuguda the lingam was being worshiped inside a hut made up of leaves. In 1916 a Gujarati contractor named Mulju Jagmal erected a small temple here. The Jamindar of Jharsuguda arranged Savayats for daily worship and donated agricultural lands for maintenance of the temple and puja. The nearest Airport is at Jharsuguda. The nearest Railway station is Jharsuguda Railway Junction. One can reach by Bus from Jharsuguda Town to Jhadeswar Temple. Purunabasti Jharsuguda Odisha 768201</p>
