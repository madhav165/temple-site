        <h1>Panchu Mahadeva Temple Ganjam</h1>
        <p>At a distance of about 3 kms towards the north of Buguda is Buddhakhol which is a scenic spot frequently visited by tourists and picnickers. Amidst natural surroundings there is a cluster of five temples on the top of a hill dedicated to Lord Siva popularly known as Panchu Mahadeva. At the upper most part of the hill a perennial stream forms a waterfal. A number of Buddhist remains have been found at the place which give the impression that it was a Buddhist settlement in ancient days. Not far from the place there are numerous caves one of which is called Siddha Gumpha where Buddhist monks were said to have performed meditation in old days. On Sivaratri and Kartika Purnima days a large number of people gather here to offer Puja at the temple.
