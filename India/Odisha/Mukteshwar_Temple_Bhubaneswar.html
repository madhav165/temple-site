        <h1>Mukteshwar Temple Bhubaneswar</h1>
        <p>Mukteshwara Temple is a 10th-century Hindu temple dedicated to God Shiva located in Bhubaneswar Odisha India. The temple dates back to 950 975 CE and is a monument of importance in the study of the development of Hindu temples in Odisha. The stylistic development of the Mukteswara marks the culmination of all earlier developments and initiates a period of experiment which continues for an entire century as seen in such temples as the Rajarani Temple and Lingaraj temple both located in Bhubaneswar. It is one of the prominent tourist attractions of the city. The Jagamohana or the entrance merges seamlessly with the sanctum sanctorum. One can see the images of Lakulisa the saint who propagated the pashupata sect of Shaivism in the state during the 6th century AD. One can also see depictions of emaciated hermits or ascetics in meditative poses in the outer walls of the temple. One interesting carving depicts a woman writing a letter. Though innocuous the carving gives an insight that woman did have a standing in the society during those days. The Mukteshvara Temple is found to be the earliest work from the Somavamshi period. Most scholars believe the temple is the successor to Parashurameshvara Temple and built earlier to the Brahmeswara Temple 1060 CE . Percy Brown puts the date of construction of the temple to 950 CE. The presence of a Torana which is not part of any other temple in the region makes this temple unique and some of the representations indicate the builders were starters of a new culture. Torana or the arched gate The signature of the temple is the Torana or the arched gate which is one of the most photographed architectural structure in India if not the world. The exquisitely carved pillars of the arched gate leaves tourists and visitors awestruck with its matchless precision and skill. This temple is built in Kalinga architecture.
