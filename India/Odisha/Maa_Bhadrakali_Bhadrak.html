        <h1>Maa Bhadrakali Bhadrak</h1>
        <p>One of the famous temple of Goddess Bhadrakali is located in the outskirts of the revenue village Aharapada which is at a distance of 5 kms away from Bhadrak town in the south- west direction. One has to go via Santhia and Utarabahini in the south-west direction of Kacheri Chhaka of Bhadrak town to reach the shrine. The popular belief is that the name of the Town has been derived from the name of the deity. The statue of Goddess is of black granite and is seated in lotus posture on a lion. The temple remains open for visitors and devotees everyday from 6.30 am to 1pm and again from 3pm to 9.30 pm. As per the nomenclature of the goddess one tends to believe that it is the goddess Kali who is being worshiped in this Bhadrakali Pitha. However since the deity is seated on a lion one school of thought has opined that the goddess can be no other than the goddess Durga.
