There are a number of folk tales and legends regarding the deity and the temple. According to one of the historical legends one merchant namely Dhaneswar who often traded with the Singhalies Srilanka had brought a deity namely Pashana Mangala from Srilanka and had established the same at Dhamara on his way back home. The said deity later on came to be known as MAA DHAMARAI. According to one MAA DHAMARAIof the folktales Maa Dhamrai had five sisters and was residing at a place called Satabhaya . Her five sisters were carnivorous in contradiction to her being purely vegetarian which had angered her sisters and they pushed her deep in to the sea. Floating on the water Maa Dhamarai came towards Chandinipala and is believed to have been caught in the fishing net of one Sanatana Dalai and Bulei Behera who had rescued her and started worshiping keeping her in their house. Later on it is believed that on the same night the queen of the then King of Kanika Sailendra Narayan Bhanjadeo saw a dream where in Maa Dhamarai ordered her to build a temple. The temple built by the then king Sailendra Narayan Bhanjadeo by the year 1953 got destroyed and the remains even was washed away into the sea. During the said period the people worshiped the deity keeping her inside a thatched roof house. Bhubaneswar the Capital Of Odisha is the nearest Air port which is 230 km away from Dhamara.
