        <h1>Huma Temple Sambalpur</h1>
        <p>A village in the Sambalpur Subdivision situated on the left bank of the Mahanadi 23 kms. south of Sambalpur. The village contains the Leaning temple dedicated to Lord Siva which was built in the reign of Baliar Singh the fifth Raja of Sambalpur. The worship of Siva is said to have been initiated by a milkman Gauda  who daily crossed the Mahanadi to a place on the bank where the underlying rock croped out. Here he daily offered his dole of milk which was at once drunk up by the rock and this miraculous circumstance led to enquiries which ended in the construction of the present temple. Huma is a place of pilgrimage and is also visited by strangers out of curosity to see the different kind of fish in the river. A great fair takes place at the foothill in March every year on the occasion of Sivratri. The presiding diety is Bimaleswar Siva. The special type of fish found here are called as Kudo fish. They are said to be so tame that they will eat sweets and other foods from the hands of those who bathe close to the temple. During auspicious days they are called by their names and given the prasad of the God. Here nobody tries to catch them as they are believed to be the assets of the God. Now about the main point of attraction i.e. the tilted structure of temple. From the investigation and interviews performed by our team nobody able to give satisfying reply. The surprising thing is the main temple tilted to one direction and other small temples tilted to some other direction. And within the temple complex i.e. within the boundaries of temple everything found to be in tilted condition including the boundaries. Now again the angle of inclination is not changed since last 40 50 years as said by the villagers and priests. However the structure is tilted may be due to some geological reason may be the earth crust is un-even in structure. About the inclination its not possible to judge whether the angle is in a increasing trend or not. For that some sort of measurement mechanism should be given to analyse it very correctly as it is done in leaning tower of Pissa.
