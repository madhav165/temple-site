        <p>Sri Biranchinarayan Temple is in Palia village which is located 15 km south of Bhadrak on the way from Bhadrak to Chandabali. It occupies a significant place in the cultural map of Orissa state of India. Today the standing Biranchi Narayan Temple stands as evidence of the heritage of Surya Upasana in Orissa. Biranchi Narayan is another name for Lord Surya the BIRANCHISun God of light and lustre. The existing temple is dedicated to Biranchinarayan who is enshrined as a roughly four faced image of the Sun. A square stone slightly tapering towards the top contains four carved images of the Sun god in relief on the four sides of a slab. The figures hold two lotuses in two hands as usual and are depicted standing on chariots drawn by seven horses. Architecturally the temple can be dated to the 13th century. It was renovated and reconstructed in the beginning of the 20th century by the generosity of a local Jamindar.
