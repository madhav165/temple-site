        <h1>Shree Govindajee Temple Imphal Manipur</h1>
        <p>Shree Govindajee Temple Imphal Manipur Shree Govindajee Temple is the largest Hindu Vaishnav temple in Imphal city in Manipur. It is located next to the palace of the former rulers of the then Manipur Kingdom. The temple is simple in design with two gold plated domes a paved court and a large raised mantapa or congregation hall. The central chamber of the garbhagriha sanctum sanctorum has the main deity of Govindaji stated to be the incarnation of Lord Krishna and his consort Radha. In the other two chambers of the sanctum on either side of the main deity images deified are of Balabhadra and Krishna on one side and images of Jagannath Subhadra and Balabhadra on the other side. The temple was originally built in 1846 during the reign of Maharaja Nara Singh and rebuilt by Maharaja Chandrakriti in 1876. The temple management was earlier with the former king as per Article II of the Manipur Merger Agreement of 1949 when Manipur became a part of India after independence. However on popular demand by the public it is now managed by a Board with members drawn from the priest community and important people of the city.The Chief Minister of the state is the Board s president. Maharaja Nara Singh 1844 50 AD of the Manipur kingdom commissioned the temple on 16 January 1846 and dedicated it to Shree Govindaji which was their royal deity. The temple and the deities were substantially damaged during an earthquake of 1868. Consequently the temple was rebuilt to its original design during the reign of Maharaja Chandrakriti 1859-1886 and was consecrated on 26 April 1876.However during the Anglo Manipur war of 1891 the idols of the temple were moved to Kongma. In 1908 after the Maharaja Churchand Singh took up residence at his new palace the idols were also moved and reconsecrated in the present temple. It is also said that  Ching-Thang Khomba Maharaja Jai Singh  or Bhagya Chandra Karta 1763 1798  who was an ardent devotee of Lord Krishna received an epiphany from the Lord to build a temple for him. Accordingly he formally initiated the carving of the idol of the Lord Govindaji in 1776 which was then completed and consecrated in November 1779 on the full moon day in a temple built by him in his palace. On this occasion Ras Lila was performed for five days at Raas Mandal Pukhri at Langthabal Shree Govindajee Temple is located in Imphal in its East district  the capital of the Indian state of Manipur in the precincts of the royal palace.Imphal is accessible by road and air services.
