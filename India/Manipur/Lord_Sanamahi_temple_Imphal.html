        <h1>Lord Sanamahi temple Imphal</h1>
        <p>The temple is located in Imphal town in the first Manipur Rifle Ground. It was patronised by king Kulachandra in 1891. The structure is raised on an octagonal base. The southern side has got flying steps. The facade carries a rectangular door. In the octagonal structure each component wall meets the double cornice. The cornice below and above has got a sequence arranged in a line over the octagonal structure. The roof structure is in pyramidal Gothic Style. The arches incline at 45 degree to form a tapering octagonal structure which is truncated by Amalaka-sila on the top in a form of a circular disc. It carries a pinnacle. The deity Lord Sanamahi is worshipped in the temple. The rituals are of typical Hindu style. The decoration of deity and puja system is based on Hindu methods. The dress of the priest performing the rituals is very similar to a Hindu priest. The puja performed by the priest daily in morning and evening at appropriate times of Ushakala and Samdhyakala. The structure is made in bricks. There has been a enough effort to explore the artistic designs in constructing the structure itself in a peculiar architectural design and by giving a stylish finish to the double cornice.</p>
