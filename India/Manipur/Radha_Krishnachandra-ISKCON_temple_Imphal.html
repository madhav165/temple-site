        <h1>Radha Krishnachandra-ISKCON temple Imphal</h1>
        <p>Shri Radha Krishna Chandra Manimandir is the centrepiece of the University of Bhagavata Culture ISKCON in Manipur. This beautiful temple is constructed by Bhaktisvarupa Damodara Swami Sripad Maharaj founder-rector of the University of Bhagavata Culture and International director of the Bhakti Vedanta Institute. Manipur is a place where Lord Krishna is held in very high esteem. He is the one Hindu deity who has a place in all Manipuris hearts. It was therefore no wonder that Imphal had its very own ISKCON mandir. Imphal Manipur 795140</p>
