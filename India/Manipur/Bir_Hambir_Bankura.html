Bir Hambir was a pious man who started following Vaishnavism. A story in two Vaishnava works Prem-vilasa of Nityananda Das alias Balaram Das and Bhakti Ratnakara of Narahari Chakrabarti recounts the manner in which Srinivasa and other devotees were robbed by Bir Hambir while travelling from Vrindavan to Gaur with a number of Vaishanava manuscripts. However Bir Hambir was so moved by Srinivasa s reading of Bhagavata that he converted to Vaishnavism and gave Srinivasa a rich endowment of land and money. He introduced the worship of Madan Mohan to Bishnupur</p>
