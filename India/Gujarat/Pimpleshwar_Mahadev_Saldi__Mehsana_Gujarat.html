        <h1>Pimpleshwar Mahadev Saldi  Mehsana Gujarat</h1>
        <p>Pimpleshwar Mahadev Saldi  Mehsana Gujarat  The temple has not been renovated for at least 100 years and therefore portrays an antique look. The surrounding landscape is filled with Pimpal trees Bili Trees and Vakhada trees. Pimpleshwar Mahadev in Saldi does not have the usual Shiv linga. Instead it has a Jaladhari  a continuous flow of water from an aquifer below the ground. The temple has images of Ganesha Parvati and Hanuman carved in stone and has smaller shrines of Amba Laks Salvabhai Patel son of Teja Patel migrated from Champaner Gujarat and raised his family in the area which ultimately came to be known as Saldi. Approximately 200 years or seven generations following the founding of Saldi village one of the cows of a herder named Petha Patel was found to be regularly releasing her milk over one location under a Pimpal tree where the Jaladhari water source was ultimately found. In the Hindu tradition worshipers of Shiva pay homage to the Shiv linga by pouring milk over it. Thus the cow s offering of her milk at this site without any assistance led to the people of Saldi to attribute this phenomenon to the presence of Lord Shiva. Since then the current site of Pimpleshwar Mahadev is considered to be very sacred by the pilgrims and villagers alike and it has become famous throughout the state of Gujarat over the years. The first temple or shrine was put in place by Petha Patel of Saldi at this site dating back to the Hindu year Vikram Samvat 1143 1086 AD . The current building was constructed and renovated by Sayajirao Gaekwad the ruler of the state Baroda in 1895 during the British colonial era in India.
