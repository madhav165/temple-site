There is a small shrine on the way from the Shamlaji Temple to the Meshwo river where an image of a standing Ganesha idol from the late-Gupta period is still worshiped. The temple at Harishchandra ni chori probably dates to the 10th century A.D. It has a rectangular sanctum with a large pavilion in front. The whole structure is enclosed within the courtyard. The walls of this courtyard have fallen down but the ornamental gateway torana still stands.

Besides the fringe frieze above mentioned there are on the outer wall between every two angles larger figures of semi-rampant elephants standing out in relief and in front of the entrance stands on either side of the doorway a gigantic cement elephant. Above the shrine a pyramid-based tower rises into a spire like a high-shouldered cone with flattened sides.
