The moulding and decoration is similar to that of walls of sabhamandapa and pillars.There were two more kirti-torana on each side of the kunda of which only one exists without upper part. Kunda a tank or reservoir is known as Ramakunda or Suryakunda. The flight of steps through kirti-torana leads to the reservoir. It is rectangular. It measures 176 feet from north to south and 120 feet from east to west. It is paved with stones all around. There are four terraces and recessed steps to descend to reach the bottom of the tank. The main entrance lies on west. There are steps to reach from one terrace to another on right angle to terrace. These steps are rectangular or square except the first step of each flight of steps which is semicircular. The stepwell on the west of Kunda has one entrance and two pavilion-towers. It is moderately ornamented. The door-frame has lotus and leaves and the ruchaka type pilasters indicate it belongs to 11th century. The small mandapa above the ground level and located on the second kuta of stepwell may belong to 10th century. The shrine proper of the Sun Temple was built during the reign of Bhima I of Chaulukya dynasty. A 1 2 3 4 Earlier during 1024-25 Mahmud of Ghazni had invaded Bhima s kingdom and a force of around 20 000 soldiers had unsuccessfully tried to check his advance at Modhera. Historian A. K. Majumdar theorizes that the Sun Temple might have been built to commemorate this defence. 5 On a block in western wall of cella there is an inscription Vikram Samvat 1083 upside down carelessly incised in Devnagari scriptwhich correspond to 1026-1027 CE. No other date is found. As the inscription is upside down it evidences the destruction and reconstruction of the cella. Due to position of the inscription it is not firmly considered as the date of construction. On the stylistic ground it is known that the kunda with its corner shrines was built earlier in the beginning of the 11th century. The inscription is rather considered as the date of destruction by Ghazni instead of the construction. Soon after Bhima had returned to the power. So the temple proper the miniature and the niche shrines in the tank was built shortly after 1026 CE. The dancing hall was added much later in the third quarter of the 12th century along with the gateways the porch of the temple proper and the doorframes of the temple and the cella during the reign of the Karna. The temple is built on 23.6 latitude approximately near Tropic of Cancer . The place was later known as Sita ni Chauriand Ramkund locally. C 12 No worship is offered here now. 3 The temple is Monument of National Importance and is maintained by Archeological Survey of India. It is located in Modhera village which is 25 km from Mehsana and 106 km from Ahmedabad in Gujarat India. Official Address</p>
