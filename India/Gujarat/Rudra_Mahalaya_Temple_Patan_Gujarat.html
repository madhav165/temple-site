Its overall dimensions were 300 by 230 feet 91 m  70 m with the central building 150 feet 46 m in length.It was a triple storied temple with 1 600 pillars 12 entrance doors and 11 shrines of Rudra positioned around it. The sanctum was located on the west and there was also a mandapa or hall which had porches on the eastern northern and southern wings. Today only a few remnants of this complex are seen such as two toranas  porches and four pillars. One torana is elaborately ornamented the eastern gate which leads to the Saraswati river still stands the remaining pillars have highly ornamented carvings. Kirti Torana of North has survived. The western part of complex converted into the congregation mosque is also there Siddhpur historically known as Sristhal. Sidhpur under the rulers of Chaulukya dynasty was a prominent town in the 10th century. In the tenth century 943 AD Mularaja the founder of the Chaulukya dynasty of Gujarat started the erection of the Rudra Mahalay temple. In his youth Muladev had slain his maternal uncle usurped his throne and murdered the whole of his mother s kindred and in old age his crimes hung heavily on his mind. He made pilgrimages and courted the favour of Brahmins from far and near. To a band of them he gave Sristhal and committing the kingdom to his son Chamundaraja he retired there to end his days in their company 996 AD . But the Rudra Mahalay was still incomplete nor was it finished till 1140 AD.An inscription and ballad regarding its construction says It was during the 12th century in 1140 AD that Jayasimha Siddharaja 1094 1144 consecrated the temple complex and it became the principal temple complex of Siddhpur. 1 According to another legend two Parmars from Malwa named Govinddas and Madhavdas took up their haunt among the rush grass that covered the neighbourhood of the Rudra Mahalaya and lived by plunder. There they found the foundations of a temple and Shiva linga and said that in the night they had seen heavenly beings. This was told to Siddharaj and led to the erection or completion of the temple. 1 In Mirat-i-Ahmadi Ali Muhammad Khan writes  The king on signifying his intention of building the temple requested the astrologers it is said to appoint a fortunate hour and they at this time predicted the destruction of the building. Then Siddha Raja caused images of horse lords and other great kings to be placed in the temple and near them a representation of himself in the attitude of supplication with an inscription praying that even if the land was laid waste this temple might not be destroyed. Alauddin Khalji sent an army under Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan who dismantled the temple complex in 1296 AD Samvat 1353 .The temple was further destroyed and the western part of it was converted into congregational mosque Jami Mosque by Muslim ruler Ahmed Shah I 1410 44 of Muzaffarid dynasty in 1414 or 1415.
