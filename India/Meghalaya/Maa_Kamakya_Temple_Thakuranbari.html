        <h1>Maa Kamakya Temple Thakuranbari</h1>
        <p>Maa Kamakya Temple at Thakuranbari was built by a Great Koch King Narayana. This temple is located on a hillock about 1 km away from Mir-Jhumla s Tomb. It is said that this temple has a connection to the famous Kamakhya Temple located at Assam. Legend has it that Maa Kamakhya s body parts were divided into 52 parts and wherever her parts fell temples are built to honour and worship her. Consequently as the story goes Maa Kamakya s navel fell at Thakuranbari and thus the temple came into existence. Apart from the deity of Kamakhya Devi the compound also houses other temples namely Siva Durga Shakti Hanuman Santoshi and swammy. Though this temple is small and still unknown it is an important pilgrimage destination as Hindu devotees and pilgrim from all over india visit the place during important occasions.</p>
