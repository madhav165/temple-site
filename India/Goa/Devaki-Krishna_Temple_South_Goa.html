        <h1>Devaki-Krishna Temple South Goa</h1>
        <p>Like many of Goa. s temples the Devaki-Krishna Temple at Marchel was moved here from two previous locations to be safe from oppression. The beautiful and unusual image in black stone is of the baby Krishna on his mother Devaki. s hip. Could the Baby Jesus and his Mother Mary represented in so many of the neighbouring churches here have given this temple its inspiration or is it simply an astonishing coincidence of the overlapping of Western and Eastern traditions</p>
