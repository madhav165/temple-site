        <h1>Tambdi Surla Temple North Goa</h1>
        <p>The most ancient temple in the whole of Goa is located at a place called Tambi Surla which is approximately 65 kms from the capital city of Panaji and 12 kilometers from the border crossing post of Mollem. Tambdi Surla itself is in the midst of a forested area accessible via a 22 kilometers route from the main town of Valpoi in Sattari Taluka. The temple itself is built in Jain style in the twelfth century. There are some interesting details about the construction itself which has led to debates about the actual origins of the temple. The temple is built in a place which is quite inaccessible and away from the main settlements of the time. The size of the temple is quite small as compared to the size of the average Goan temple. And finally the top part of the temple has never been completed. The temple is located at the foot of the Anmod Ghat which connects Goa to the state of Karnataka. It is considered to be the only specimen of Kadamba-Yadava architecture in basalt stone preserved and available in Goa. Near Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctury Sanguem Surla Goa 403406</p>
