        <h1>Ramnath Temple South Goa</h1>
        <p>The second temple in the small village of Bandode or Bandivade as it is also known is that of Lord Ramnath. Located about 22 kilometers from the capital city of Panaji the temple is just a few minutes away from Farmagudi off the main road to Ponda. Legend has it that the name of Lord Ramnath comes from the place Rameshwar. It is said that Lord Rama after slaying Ravana in the battle was filled with remorse at the killing. In order to seek redemption for his act he installed a Shivalinga symbol of Lord Shiva  on the shores and hence came to be known as Rameshwar or Ramnath. The idol of Lord Ramnath was initially housed in a temple at a settlement called Lotli present-day Loutolim which was set up by Gaud Saraswat Brahmins who had migrated from Rameshwar on the southern shores of India. Lord Ramnath like many other deities in Goa was removed from the original temple at Loutolim and smuggled away to its present day abode of Bandivade to avoid persecution by the Portuguese regime. Bandivade was under the control of Bijapur at the time.</p>
