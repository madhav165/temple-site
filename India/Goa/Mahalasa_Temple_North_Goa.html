        <p>The temple of Mahalsa Narayani is located at the small village of Mardol just about a km from the famous Mangueshi temple and about 22 kilometers from Panaji the capital city. Originally the deity was housed in a temple at an ancient shrine in village of Verna which is now the site of an industrial estate. Along with other Goan temples this beautiful temple at Verna was also marked for destruction by the Portuguese around 1543. The more famous legend has it that in ancient times a beautiful goddess appeared on the Sonsada plateau at Verna. She was first seen by a shepherd named Sahastrapal who was taking his master s cattle for grazing to a nearby spring. The goddess asked the shepherd to bring his master to the location. When the shepherd appeared reluctant saying that the cattle were thirsty the goddess created a spring by hitting the ground with her nupur musical ornament worn on the ankle . The small Nupur Lake which was thus created can still be seen today.
