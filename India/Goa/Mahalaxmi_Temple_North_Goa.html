        <h1>Mahalaxmi Temple North Goa</h1>
        <p>Mahalaxmi Temple North Goa One of the capital city s most discerning assets is the Mahalaxmi Temple. Located on the Dada Vaidya road Rua de Saudade during the Portuguese times  the Mahalaxmi deity is the chief object of veneration for all Panjimites irrespective of caste class sex or creed. The city blessed by three historic ecclesiastical monuments  the Jamma Masjid the Church of Immaculate Conception and the Mahalaxmi temple  surprisingly standing on the same road pose a perfect symmetry of communal harmony and camaraderie. This 182-year-old temple has a fascinating history. In the 16th century the Havig Brahmins from Karwar-Kumtha areas who lived on alms and charity of others worshipped the Mahalaxmi deity and wherever they went in search of alms they carried this deity along. In the 16th century they moved to Goa along with this diety and reached Taleigo village of which Panjim was then a mere ward along the river Gomati Mandovi .  NA   NA  Situated in Bandora Village this temple lies 4 km to the east of Ponda. It s at a distance of some 45 km from Naguesh Temple and a drive down from there will take you around an hour to reach here.
