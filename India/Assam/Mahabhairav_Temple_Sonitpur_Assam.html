        <p>Mahabhairav Temple Sonitpur Assam Archaeologist believe that the temple was built during 8th to 10th century A.D. by the kings of the Salasthamba dynasty which is evident by the presence of huge stone pillars scattered all around the temple.The original temple was destroyed during the Islamic invasions of the Middle Ages.It was again rebuilt by the successive kings and rulers until it was heavily damaged by the catastrophic earthquake of 1897.The present structure of the temple was built sometime in the early part of the present century by a devotee and ascetic Sri Swayambar Bharati popularly known as Naga Baba.After a few years another Sri Mahadeo Bharati built the Nat Mandir close to the temple. After a few years another devotee built the cement-concrete idols of Ganesh and Hanuman as Dwarpaals in front of the temple  Official Address</p>
