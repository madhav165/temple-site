        <h1>Ugra Tara Temple Guwahati</h1>
        <p>Ugro Tara Temple is an important Sakti shrine dedicated to Tara Devi located in the western side of Jur Pukhuri in the heart of Guwahati city in the Latasil. Legend has it that the navel of Sati first consort of Shiva is related to this temple. The present temple of Ugra Tara was built by Ahom King Siva Singha in 1725 AD who had excavated a tank three years before known as Jur Pukhuri which is situated to the east of the temple. The tank still exists though the upper section of the temple was destroyed by a devastating earthquake. This was however rebuilt by a private citizen. Kalika purana describes a Shakti peetha called Dikkaravasini. Dikkaravasini has two forms Tikshna kantha and Lalitha kantha. Tikshna kantha is black and potbellied also called as Ugra Tara or Ekajata. Lalitha kantha is gracefully attractive also called as Tamreshwari. Lamb Rd Uzan Bazar Guwahati Assam 781001</p>
