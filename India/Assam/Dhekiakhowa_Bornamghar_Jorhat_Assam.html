        <h1>Dhekiakhowa Bornamghar Jorhat Assam</h1>
        <p>Dhekiakhowa Bornamghar Jorhat Assam Dhekiakhowa Bornaamghar is a naamghar in Jorhat district Assam India that was established by saint-reformer Madhavdeva . He kindled an earthen lamp there which has been continuously burning since then being religiously refuelled with mustard oil by the priests till date. It is located at Dhekiakhowa village of Jorhat district 15 km towards the east of Jorhat city 3.5 km away from National Highway 37.It is called a Bornaamghar because of its historical association and large campus. The naamghar is situated in a complex of facilities spread over 13 bighas of land. The naamghar and other facilities are maintained by a managing committee with donations from devotees. Besides the maintenance of the complex the managing committee sponsors various social and cultural programs.There is an anecdote after the name of Dhekiakhowa Naamghar. Guru Madhavdeva after taking up the duty of reforming people and spreading the Ekasarana Nam Dharma came to stay in this small and very poor village. He took shelter for the night at the hut of an old woman who served him rice with Dhekia Saak a very common wild vegetable but very popular and with an excellent taste . The old woman was very embarrassed to have served the Saint guru like this but he was immensely pleased by the dinner. So he started a namghar there and given the responsibility of kindling the earthen lamp to the old woman. That is why the naamghar was later khown as Dhekiakhowa Naamghar.The place is inevitably named after the Naamghar itself.A lot of visitors and devotees gather in the naamghar everyday especially during the sacred month of Bhado August September  for this month being the Death Anniversaries of both the gurus Srimanta Sankardeva and Madhavdeva  Official Address</p>
