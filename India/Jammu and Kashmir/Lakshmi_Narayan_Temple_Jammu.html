        <h1>Lakshmi Narayan Temple Jammu</h1>
        <p>Lakshmi Narayan Temple of Jammu is situated in Gandhi Nagar area. It was built by Raja Jambu Lochan early centuries and thus counted as one of the ancient temples of the region. This temple is not as famous as Raghunath temple and Bawey Wali mata but is definitely worth a visit. Huge numbers of devotees flock to the temple to seek blessings of Lord Narayanan and Goddess Lakshmi.</p>
