The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and it is believed that the shrine have been positioned in the same place where the Pandavas spent a few days in Bhaderwah during their exile days. Even one of the rocks at the temple has the footprint of Bhim the 2nd Pandava brother. The temple is located on the bank of Neru River and made up of purely stone slab. Indeed the dome of the temple is also made of stones in circular shape. According to legend River Ganga suddenly falls on the Shiv lingam and then disappeared and this is why it is known as Gupt Ganga. Forest Block Jammu and Kashmir 182222</p>
