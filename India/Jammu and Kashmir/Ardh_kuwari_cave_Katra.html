        <h1>Ardh kuwari cave Katra</h1>
        <p>The term Adhkuwari is believed to have come from Adi kumari which means The Eternal Virgin . According to the legend when Vaishnavi in the form of a small girl disappeared from the Bhandaara organized by Pandit Shridhar she halted at Banganga and Charan Paduka. From there she reached Adhkuwari where in a small womb shaped cave she meditated and observed spiritual discipline Tapasya for nine long months. The exact spot where she is believed to have meditated is located at the right hand side inside the cave and is shaped like a womb. Since Vaishnavi had observed spiritual discipline in a womb shaped cave for a period of nine months this cave has become popular by the name of Garbh Joon which has come from the term Garbh Yoni meaning the Womb. It is generally believed that by merely passing through this cave a devotee s sins are cleansed and his soul becomes pious again. The cave temple falls on the route to Bhavan approximately midway between Katra and the main shrine. You can get here on foot or helicopter.
