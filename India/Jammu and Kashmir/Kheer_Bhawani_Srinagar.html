        <h1>Kheer Bhawani Srinagar</h1>
        <p>Kheer Bhawani is a temple of goddess Ragnya Devi constructed over a sacred spring in Tula Mula village at a distance of 14 miles east of Srinagar. It has got the term kheer as most of the devotees offer kheer rice pudding to goddess an incarnation of Durga Bhawani. This temple is one of the most revered religious sites for Kashmiri Pandits. The sacred spring is widely known for its mystical power to changes its color. While most of the colors do not have any significance the black is considered as an inauspicious time for Kashmir. In 1912 Maharaja Pratap Singh constructed the temple and later Maharaja Hari Singh repaired it. Presently the temple runs under the Dharmath Trust led by Dr. Karan Singh. Devotees from far and wide visit the temple to seek blessings of the mother goddess. The eight day of full moon in the month of May is considered to be sacred and also believed that on this day the sacred spring changed its color. An annual mela is also held in the premises of the temple during this period. Pilgrims in huge numbers thronged the temple to celebrate the day. One can easily reach Kheer Bhavani Temple by taking regular Buses or by hiring Taxis from Srinagar Duderhama Ganderbal Bridge Tulla Mulla 193501 Jammu and Kashmir</p>
