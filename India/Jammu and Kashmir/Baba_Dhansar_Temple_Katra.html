        <h1>Baba Dhansar Temple Katra</h1>
        <p>Baba Dhansar Temple is located 15 km away from Katra on way to Salal Dam. A huge spring emerging from the rocks forms a number of small cascading waterfalls before flowing into the holy river that merges with the Chenab River. At Baba Dhansar Temple devotees find a naturally formed Shivling on which droplets of water fall at a constant pace throughout the year.</p>
