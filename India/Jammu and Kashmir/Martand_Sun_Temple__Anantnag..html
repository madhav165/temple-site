Martand Sun Temple a spectacular shrine dedicated to Surya the Sun  lies at a distance of over five miles from Anantnag in the heavenly state of Jammu and Kashmir India. This structure is a Kashmiri Hindu Temple and is known as one of the most elegant structures ever built in India. Even in a wrecked state the temple shares it s story with the ones who genuinely want to listen.
