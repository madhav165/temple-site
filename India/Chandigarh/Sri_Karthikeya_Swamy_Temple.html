        <h1>Sri Karthikeya Swamy Temple</h1>
        <p>Sri Karthikeya Swamy Temple is one of the most revered temples in the city. Built by Tamils this beautifully carved Dravidian-style temple features a gopuram that is a mix of Chola and Pallava architecture. In the 1980s when Punjab was facing militancy issues Tamils felt that only Lord Murugan  the evil-fighting warrior God  could protect them from any adversity. They installed a small vel spear here on a pedestal and started worshipping it. Soon their prayers were answered and the entire region was free of militants by 1990. Thereafter a full-fledged shrine with beautiful idols of Lord Karthikeya and other deities was built on the site and a grand consecration ceremony was performed in 1992.  Sector 31D Chandigarh</p>
