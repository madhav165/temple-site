The inner temple was constructed around 5th century by the Pallav dynasty. The Chola kings and the Vijayanagara kings constructed the outer temple in the 12th century. The entire temple is carved out of the side of a huge stone hill. The mandapam with 100 pillars and the 120 feet 37 m high main gopuram were constructed by Krishnadevaraya the Vijayanagara king in 1516. The temple complex abounds in lithic records stone inscriptions of Chola kings such as Rajaditya regnal years 947-949 CE  Raja Raja Chola regnal years 985-1014 CE  his son Rajendra Chola 1012-1044 CE  his son Rajadhiraja 1018-1054 CE  Kulottunga I 1070-1120 CE and Kulotunga III 1178-1218 CE . According to Hindu mythology the elephant or Hasti used to clean the Shiva deity by watering the idol with the help of river-water carried in his trunks and pray for him by placingBilva leaves. The spider or Sri tried to protect the deity from external damage by weaving his web and to provide shelter for the Shiva lingam. The snake or Kala used to place its precious gem on the linga to adorn the lord. In this way they all worshipped the Vayu linga separately without knowing what the other was doing. One day the spider had built a very big and thick web around the deity to protect it from dust and weather while the snake places its gem. The elephant not knowing this and assuming that this form of puja by Sri and Kala is a desecration by the seeming miscreants pours water on it and cleans it up. This causes a fight between the three. The snake punishes the elephant by entering its trunk and in the process kills itself while the elephant runs amok and hits its trunk and head against the shiva linga. During this struggle the spider is squashed against the linga by the elephant s trunk and the elephant dies due to the snake s poison. Lord Shiva then appeared and gave moksha to all three of them for their selfless devotion. The spider takes rebirth as a great king while the elephant and the snake reaches heaven for satisfying all its karma. This king continues his good work from his previous birth and builds a variety of temples that seeks to protect the underlying deity with tons of stones. It is interesting to note that all his temples keep the deity beyond the access of an elephant. In this temple access to the deity is through a narrow passage in the side of the building that prevents an elephant from extending its trunk over the lord from any side.
