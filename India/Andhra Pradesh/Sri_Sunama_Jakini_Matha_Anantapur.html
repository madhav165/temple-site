She married to Hanumanthakari Thanji Rao at a very young age. She was very devotional and use to observe fasting very often. One day during fasting she fell unconscious. Her husband thought that she is dead and ordered to bury her. Localites requested her husband to pass on the message to her mother father and brothers who live in Pinnepalli village. Her husband did not allow this. As localites were getting ready to bury her they found that Sunama maatha is still alive and informed the same to her husband. Under alcohol effect her husband ordered them to bury her anyway. In that sense Sunama Jakini maatha has taken jeeva samadhi Buddhism Nirvana .
