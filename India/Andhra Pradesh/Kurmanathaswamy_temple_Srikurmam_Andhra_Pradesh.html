It is dedicated to the Kurma avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu who is worshipped as Kurmanathaswamy and his consort Lakshmi worshipped as Kurmanayaki. According to Hindu legend the presiding deity is believed to have manifested here in the form of a tortoise-shaped idol upon the wishes of Swetha Chakravarthi. Brahma then consecrated the idol with Gopala Yantra. The temple is famous for ancestor worship. Srikurmam is the only Indian temple in the world where Vishnu is worshiped in his Kurma avatar. Initially dedicated to Shiva and referred to as Kurmeswara temple Ramanuja is said to have converted Srikurmam into a Vaishnavite temple in the 11th century AD. Since then the temple was regarded as an important centre of Vaishnavism in the medieval period along with Simhachalam. The temple has two dhvajasthambas a rarity for a Vaishnavite temple. 108 ekasila single-stone pillars with none resembling each other bear few inscriptions related to the royal lineages that existed in this area in the past. A tortoise park has been built to conserve the adult and young star tortoises making Srikurmam the only conservation centre for this species.Srikurmam follows both Shaivite and Vaishnavite traditions of worship. Four daily rituals and four annual festivals are celebrated in Srikurmam out of which the three-day Dolotsavam is the major one.
