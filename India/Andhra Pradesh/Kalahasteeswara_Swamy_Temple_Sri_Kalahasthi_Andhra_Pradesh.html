        <h1>Kalahasteeswara Swamy Temple Sri Kalahasthi Andhra Pradesh</h1>
        <p>Kalahasteeswara Swamy Temple Sri Kalahasthi Andhra Pradesh Vayu is incarnated as Lord Shiva and worshipped as Kalahasteeswara. Goddess Parvathi Devi is worshiped here as Gnanaparasunambikai. It is one of the most famous Shiva temples in South India and is said to be the site where Kannappa one of the 63 Saivite Nayanmars was ready to offer both his eyes to cover blood flowing from the Siva Linga before the Lord Siva stopped him and granted him Mukthi. The inner temple was constructed around 5th century and the outer temple was constructed in the 12th century by the Chola Kings and the Vijaya Nagara kings. The Shivalinga at Sri Kalahasti is marked by symbols of three creatures  that of a spider at the bottom a five-hooded snake on top and elephant-tusks on either side. Legend informs us that Sri spider  Kala snake and Hasti elephant were cursed by Brahma Shiva and Parvati but attained moksha by worshipping Lord Shiva here. Hence Shiva came to be called Sri Kalahasteeswara. It is one of the shrines of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams  Shiva Sthalams glorified in the early medieval Thevaram poems by Tamil Saivite Nayanar Sundarar. This is one of the 276 Devara Paadal Petra Shiva Sthalams and 19th Shiva Sthalam in Thondai Nadu. A lamp burns inside the inner sanctum that constantly flickers despite the lack of air movement inside. Kalahasti is located near the pilgrimage town of Tirupati and is visited by thousands of pilgrims. The river Swarnamukhi takes the northerly course at Sri Kalahasthi almost washing the west wall of the famous Sri Kalahasthi temple. The temple architecture is a treat to the eyes for all those who visit Srikalahasthi.  The temple remains open from 5.00 a.m. to 12.00 a.m. and 5.00 p.m. to 9.00 p.m. Thousands of pilgrims visit this temple to have darshan of the almighty Sri Kalahasteeswara and Sri Gnanaparasunambikai Devi. Sri Kalahasteeswara showers grace to wipe out the sins and obstacles of devotees. Worshipping Sri Kalahasteeswara results in dispelling all worldly miseries and attaining marvelous spiritual happiness. Goddess Gnanaparasunambikai Devi received the Panchakshara mantra from the Lord himself. The Goddess arrived at the place and started her penance here. Of the nine planets Kalahasthi importance is attached to Rahu and Ketu Dragon s tail and head respectively those afflicted with the adverse effects of these planets and problems related to snakes pray for relief here. After fulfillment of the prayers devotees perform Abhishek to the Lord offer Vastras clothes and also offer donation for the maintenance of the temple depending on their affordability.

There are weekly monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 6am  12 pm and 4-8 30 pm. Kalahasthi temple is closely attached with the history of Kannappar whose bhakti devotion is yet to be equaled in the history of the religious literature of Tamilnadu. Acharya Shankara had devoted a verse in praise of Kannappar in his celebrated Shivanandalahari. Sekkizhar in his Periyapuranam elaborately sings the greatness of Kannappar in 185 verses. Kannappar performed abishek to the Lord bringing water from the Swarnamukhi river in his mouth. Vibhuti Prasad is not offered in this temple but symbolizing the Abishek Theertha of Kannappar only Theertha Prasad water is offered to the devotees mixed with Pachai Karpooram. It is offered through a conch. The Vibhuti sacred ash brought by the devotees are placed at the feet of the Lord an Arati is offered and returned to the devotee. Abishek is performed to the Lord only with water mixed with Pachai Karpooram. Other Abisheks are offered only to the stage called Avudayar  the Linga Peetam . As the Shrine is related to Rahu-Ketu planets devotees do the Pradikshina in an anti-clockwise way. As sage Bharadhwaja performed penance here only those belonging to the Bharadhwaja Gotra are appointed as archakas in the temple. The Kavacham covering the Lord has the symbols of the planets hence there is no separate shrine for the Navagrahas except for Saturn. Garlands are not offered on the body of Lord. An Angi  upper cloth  is placed on the Lord on which Thumba Flower Garland is placed. In the Oddiyanam belt made of gold studded with pearls and precious stones  of Mother Gnanaparasunambikai the symbol of planet Kethu is carved. There is a temple for Lord Manikandeswarar on the slopes of the hill through which Kannappar went on the hill taking his Abishek Water from Ponmuhali river. There is also a mandap called Manikarnika Gattam near this temple carved out of the hill. The story goes that it is here Lord Shiva uttered the Tharaka Mantra to a woman commonly known as Karna Manthra being uttered on the ears of the departing soul as Lord Viswanatha did in Kasi  Varanasi to a devotee. Following this tradition devotees use to bring those nearing their end to Manikarnika Gattam and place them lying here so that the last breath may leave the mortal body through the right ear. Procession of Lord is taken from the North tower entrance. As Maharishis worshipped the Lord facing the east after a dip in the Ponmuhali river Lord Kalathiappar is facing west to bless the Rishis. Maha Shivaratri is the most important festival when lakhs of devotees offer prayers to seek the blessings of the Lord. Mahasivarathri Brahmotsavams are celebrated in par with Maha Shivaratri for 13 days during which the Utsava Murtis of Siva and Parvati will be taken on Vahanams in a procession around the temple streets. The fifth day of the festival in the month of Maasi coincides with the Maha Shivaratri. Mahasivarathri Nandi Seva Lingodbhavam Rathotsavam Theppotsavam and Swami-Ammavarla Kalyanotsavam are the important aspects of this festival. Shivaratri Vinayaka Chaturthi Vijayadasami Thirukarthigai in November-December Oonjal festival on all Fridays Makara Sankaranthi Pongal in January and Giri Valam on Shivarathri day are the other important festivals celebrated here. 9-30 PM on Saturday to Monday Srikalahasthi Srikalahasthi is named after Sri spider Kala Snake Hasti Elephant . They were staunch devotees of Lord Shiva. According to Hindu mythology the elephant or Hasti used to clean the Shiva deity by watering the idol with the help of river-water carried in his trunks and pray for him by placing Vilva leaves. The spider or Sri tried to protect the deity from external damage by weaving his web and to provide shelter for the Shiva lingam. The snake or Kala used to place its precious gem on the Linga to adorn the lord. In this way they all worshipped the Vayu Linga separately without knowing what the other was doing. One day the spider had built a very big and thick web around the deity to protect it from dust and weather while the snake places its gem. The elephant not knowing this and assuming that this form of puja by Sri and Kala is a desecration by the seeming miscreants pours water on it and cleans it up. This causes a war between the three. The snake punishes the elephant by entering its trunk and in the process kills itself while the elephant runs amok and hits its trunk and head against the Shiva Linga. During this struggle the spider is squashed against the Linga by the elephant s trunk and the elephant dies due to the snake s poison. Lord Shiva then appeared and gave moksha to all three of them for their selfless devotion. The spider takes rebirth as a great king while the elephant and the snake reaches heaven for satisfying all its karma. This king continues his good work from his previous birth and builds a variety of temples that seeks to protect the underlying deity with tons of stones. It is interesting to note that all his temples keep the deity beyond the access of an elephant. In this temple access to the deity is through a narrow passage in the side of the building that prevents an elephant from extending its trunk over the lord from any side. This temple is considered as the Kailash of the South or Dakshina Kailasam. At the foot of the Linga one can see a spider two elephant tusks and a five-headed the five elements serpent to remind the devotee of these acts of supreme devotion. The legend here is similar to that of the Jambukeswarar temple at Tiruvanaikkaa. Vayu Lingam During the early days of creation Lord Vayu performed penance for thousands of years to Karpoora Lingam  Karpooram means camphor . Pleased with his penance Lord Shiva manifested before him and said  O Vayu Deva Though you are dynamic in nature you stayed here without movement and did penance for me. I m pleased with your devotion. I shall grant you three boons . Lord Vayu said  Swami I want to be present everywhere in this world. I want to be an integral part of every Jiva who is none other than the manifestation of Paramatma. I want to name this Karpoora Linga which represents you after me. Samba Siva said  You are qualified for these three boons. As per your wish you will be spread throughout this world. Without you there will be no life. This Linga of mine will forever be known all over through your name and all Suras Asuras Garuda Gandharvas Kinnaras Kimpurushas Siddhas Saadhvis humans and others will worship this Lingam . Lord Shiva disappeared after granting these boons. Thereafter this Karpoora Vayu Lingam is worshipped by all Lokas worlds . Gnana Prasunambika Devi Once Parvati was cursed by Lord Shiva to discard her heavenly body and assume the human form. To get rid of the above curse Parvati did a long penance here. Pleased with her deep devotion Lord Shiva again recreated her body  a hundred times better than her previous heavenly body and initiated various mantras including the Panchakshari. Consequent to this Parvati gained fame and came to be known as Shiva-Gnanam Gnana Prasunamba or Gnana Prasunambika Devi. Ghanakala prayed to Lord Shiva here Cursed to become a ghost Ghanakala prayed at Srikalahasthi for 15 years and after chanting the Bhairava Mantra many times Lord Shiva restored her original form. Mayura Chandra and Devendra prayed to Lord Shiva here Mayura Chandra and Devendra were also freed from their curses after taking bath in the river Swarnamukhi and praying at Srikalahasthi. Lord Shiva preached to Sage Markandeya here To Markandeya Lord Shiva appeared in Srikalahasthi and preached that a Guru alone could make esoteric teachings and therefore he is Brahma Vishnu and Maheswara. Legends of Kannappa Nayanar Kannappa Nayanar was an enthusiastic devotee of Lord Shiva and a hunter by profession. It is believed that once he saw blood coming out of the eyes of the Lord Shiva. Kannappa plucked out one of his eyes and placed in the eye of Linga which was oozing with blood and tears. When the tears and the blood were still trickling from another eye Kannappa decided to remove his second eye and placed one of his feet on the spot of the right eye of the Shiva Linga. Before he could pull out his second eye with the arrow Lord Shiva appeared and restored his eye and for this reason earned the name Kannappan his original name being Thinnan and the distinction of having his statue adorn the sanctum. This act of Kannappa placed him among the 63 Nayanmars. At Sri Kalahasthi Lord Shiva tested the unshakable devotion of Kannappa Nayanar before the sages gathered at Srikalahasthi. With his divine power Lord Shiva created a tremor and the roof tops of the temple began to fall. All the sages ran away from the scene except Kannappa who covered the Linga with his body to prevent it from any damage. According to Swami Sivananda s book Sixty-Three Nayanar Saints some Saivite traditions believe that Kannappa was the reincarnation of Arjuna. Arjuna worshipped Siva for seeking the Pasupatha Astra and failed to recognize him in the form of a hunter. Thus according to this tradition Arjuna had to be born as a hunter and adore the Lord before attaining final liberation. Flickering Flame in the Hanging Lamp at Sanctum In the sanctum sanctorum of this temple is a hanging lamp that always keeps swinging with a flickering flame though there is no visible inlet for wind. No one knows where the wind comes from is a mystery.
