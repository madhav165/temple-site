        <h1>Ambalapuzha Sri Krishna Temple Alapuzha Kerala</h1>
        <p>This temple dedicated to Lord Krishna in the mood of Lord Parthasarathy is famous for it s Palpayasa i.e. milk kheer. Here the Deity of Lord Krishna has a whip in His right hand and a conch in His left hand. Many interesting pastimes of the Deity here have been recorded in the temple history. The temple was also a safehouse for the Deity of Sri Guruvayurappan of Guruvayur for a period of 12 years during the invasion of Tipu Sultan. It is said that Lord Guruvayurappan is very much attracted by the Palpayasa offering here that He personally comes here during the Naivedya i.e offering time to relish the same and goes back to Guruvayur.
