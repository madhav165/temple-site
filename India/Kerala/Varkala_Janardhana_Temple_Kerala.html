Sage Narada after paying his respects to Lord Narayana left Vaikuntam to see Brahma. Enraptured by the sweet music of Narada Narayana followed him unobserved. When Narada reached Brahmaloka Brahma saw Narayana following his son Narada and offered salutations to him at which Vishnu realizing the awkward situation suddenly disappeared. Brahma found that the person whom he had revered was his own son Narada. The Prajapathis who were laughing at this incident were cursed by Brahma that they would be born on earth and suffer the miseries of human beings. Narada advised them to perform penance at the place he himself would select for them. Narada threw his Valkalam  bark upper garment into the air and at the place where it fell down they consecrated a temple for Janardanaswamy a name of Vishnu . Hence the name Varkala is a corruption of Valkala  but the name came into prominent usage. According to the legend attracted by the music from Narada s Veena Lord Vishnu started following him and reached Satyaloka. Seeing Lord Vishnu Brahma prostrated before him. Lord Vishnu soon realized that he has reached Satyaloka but did not realize that Lord Brahma is prostrating before him and left back to Vaikunta. It seemed as if Lord Brahma is falling towards the feet of Narada and all the present Devas laughed. This made Brahma angry and he cursed Devas to be born as humans in the earth. Devas repented their folly and begged to be forgiven. Brahma replied that the curse would be withdrawn when they do a penance to please Lord Janardana. Devas asked where that place is where they should do the penance. Brahma told them that the place where Sage Narada s Vastra falls will be the sacred place. It is Varkala where his Vastra fell and Devas did the penance accordingly to get relieved of the curse. According to Mahabharata Balabhadran has visited the place for pilgrimage.
