        <h1>Muthappan Temple kannur kerala</h1>
        <p>Muthappan Temple kannur kerala Parassinikadavu Muthappan temple is a temple located at Anthoor Municipality on the banks of the Valapattanam river about 10 km from Taliparamba and 16 km from Kannur City in Kannur District Kerala.Principal deity of the temple is Sree Muthappan whose divinity is presented as a ritualistic theyyam enactment in two versions called Thiruvappana and Vellattam. According to the local tradition the presiding deity is a manifestation of Shiva. Vellattam and Thiruvappana are the generic names for two types of  Theyyam Ketti-aadal  in the kavu temples of North Malabar. Vellattom is a minor version of the ritual enactment where the ornaments decorations and parapharnelia are minimal thanks to which all actions including vaaythari speech is maximum and Attam dance will be at its peak. If you compare this level of enactment to the idol of a deity in a temple sanctum which is installed as per sathwic sasthra and vedic rituals Vellattom is at par with the idol alone without the prabha-mandalam which circles it. A more easier example is the Seeveli ceremony with only the small idol on top of the elephant. On the other hand Thiruvappana is the full version with royal regalia and bigger dimension of prabhamandalam. Because the decorations are more and are of binding nature the action is minimal and sluggish and the uriyaadal replies to prayers will be crisp to the point and predictions will be accurate. To compare Thiruvappana stands at par with temple idol with the Prabha-mandalam representing the auric circle around it and the Seeveli with the big Swarna-Kolam covering the small idol on top of the elephant . Muthappan is considered as the manifestation of Lord Shiva himself in Nayattu hunter format. The Vellattam which comes initially is Siva himself as the said minimal version. But the Vellattom which comes along with the grand Thiruvappana of Muthappan later on is the minimal version of Vishnu who according to mythology comes to Siva s assistance when he started travelling with the poykannu blindfold and started suffering serious difficulties to travel and hunt for food. Rituals of the temple is unique in that it does not follow the Satvic Brahminical form of worship as in other Hindu temples of Kerala. The main mode of worship is the ritual enactment of both the versions of Muthappan through a traditional dance known as Muthappan Theyyam.Fish meat and toddy are the customary offerings to Muthappan.Muthappan Thiruvoppana Mahothsavam is the major festival of the temple celebrated for three days every year on 19 20 and 21 of Kumbham  A version of the legend of Ponnu Muthappan is narrated here The King of Ancharamana in Eruvessi village and his wife Padikutty Antharjanam had no offsprings. Padikutty was an ardent devotee of Shiva and when she found a baby floating in a basket of flowers in the river water when she was coming back after a bath in the river she took it as the blessing of Lord Shiva and so was her husband. The child grew up and in his boyhood he was always for the benefit of downtrodden and poor people. However to the agony of his family he practiced hunting and also started eating flesh which was not allowed for a Naduvazhi. Unable to bear the indictments from his family the boy decided to leave home. When his mother attempted to stop him he looked at her in fury and appeared in his original godly figure before the parent. She bowed down before her son. Nonetheless she requested him to cover his eyes with a Poikannu a type of shield for the eyes since she was afraid that such a fiery look on another occasion may cause to emanate the cosmic force Shakti that could change the entire world. Wearing a shield on his eyes he left the family and passed through various villages in Malabar such as Kunnathurpadi Puralimala Padavil Thillenkeri Kannapuram Parassinikadavu and Valluvankadav. 5 7 The legend relates Muthappan with a tribal family for the divine boy started being called as Muthappan . Accordingly when he reached a village called Kunnathurpadi he got a tribalman Chantan as his friend. One day when he saw Chantan tapping toddy from Palm tree the boy asked for it but was denied. All of sudden Chantan was cursed and became a stone. His wife prayed and offered to perform the rituals Oottu Tiruvappana and Amruthakalasam to propitiate the boy in the month of Dhanu. The boy relented and gave her husband back. The Chantan family started to conduct pooja to propitiate the boy and they called him in the name  Muthappan . However according to another version of the legend Muthappan climbed the coconut tree and emptied the toddy jar in the absence of Chantan. When Chantan returned and saw Muthappan holding the jar he was provoked and defied the latter. It was at this instant Chantan was cursed. 7 The legend also describes a dog which always followed Muthappan throughout his journey. Hence in the temple of Muthappan dogs are considered divine and the temple entrance has an idol of dog at both sides. Official Address</p>
