The soldiers of Chempakassery Raja killed one Unni of Changazhimuttom family of Kuttanadu who has gone there to measure the Patta Nelu of Devaswom at Venattukara field. He is installed as a Bhramma Rakshas in this temple. In order to satisfy the Bhrahmma Rakshas  Kazhumaram was being made in front of the Rakshas Shrine and the Prathiroopam of Chempakassery Raja is hanged. But later these forms were removed. The Raja gave the pooja items for Pantheeradi to the temple as a mark of his repentance for killing Unni.
