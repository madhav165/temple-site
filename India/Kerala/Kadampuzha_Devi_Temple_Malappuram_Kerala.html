        <h1>Kadampuzha Devi Temple Malappuram Kerala</h1>
        <p>Kadampuzha Devi Temple Malappuram Kerala Kadampuzha Devi Temple is a Hindu temple and pilgrimage center at Kadampuzha in Malappuram district Kerala India. The temple is dedicated to goddess Durga Form of Goddess Parvati  a Devi. There is no idol in the temple and the Goddess is worshipped in a pit. There are also shrines for Sastha and Serpent deities along with the worship of Ganapathi Narasimha and Sudarshana. There is also a Shiva temple nearby called Madambiyarkavu . The temple owned by Malabar Devaswom Board under the Government of Kerala is administered through a trust consisting of the Hindu-Variar family and non hereditary co-opted trustees. It is the richest temple under Malabar Devaswom Board. The origin of this temple is associated with the epic Mahabharata. During the 5th year of exile Arjuna left the place in order to seek and obtain the knowledge of Divya Astras which could be obtained only by performing the greatest penance with sincerity and devotion. Arjuna wanted Pashupathastra the supreme astra of Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva and his consort Goddess Parvati wanted to test Arjuna. Disguised as Kirata King and wife respectively they approached Arjuna. At the same time a demon named Mukasura took the form of a wild boar and destroyed nature in order to disturb Arjuna s meditation. Both Lord Shiva and Arjuna shot an arrow and killed Mukasura. Lord Shiva disguised as the Kirata king argued with Arjuna and they finally came to conclusion that they would have a bow and arrow battle. In the fierce battle Arjuna was defeated. Disappointed over the defeat he placed a big stone in front of him and prayed to Goddess Adi Parashakthi. The flowers he showered on the stone fell at the feet of Kirata and Kirati. He then realized that those were Lord Shiva and Devi Parvathi. Pleased with this Lord Shiva granted him the arrow he desired. The hole divined to be the one created by the mighty arrow of Lord Shiva that summoned Ganaga for quenching Parvathi s thirst was perceived as the Devine Power Source by Adi Shankara and hence there is no idol to represent the Presence here. That there are no idols here is also a unique aspect of Kadampuzha. To mark this place and for the common man s reference a Thidambu or Arch is kept on top. Only during the Poo Moodal rite the Thidumbu is removed and the hole exposed. Adi Shankara built the temple over this spot in the method prescribed by Thachu Sastra and on the stone right in front of this the where the divine presence of Lord Shiva was perceived he consecrated Narasimha Moorthy and the Sudarshana Chakra each facing South and North respectively. On the South side of the temple Naga Kanya was consecrated and Shastav on the North. Then around 1949 when Shree M.K Achutha Warier was the trustee the sanctum sanctorum was rebuilt using laterite stones and the roof was built using jack wood and tiles. However only the North side was completed and the other three were laid bare. During this time the pilgrimage to the temple was rather bleak and the temple trustees found the upkeep rather tough. Then in 1974 a Deva Prashnam was conducted and according to the divinations then made Bharmashree Andaladi Divakaran Namboothiripad was made the Thantri Chief Priest and the compensatory poojas and other poojas for prosperity conducted by him brought about a huge change. Pilgrims started to folk Kadampuzha again and year after year this improved. Deva Prashnam was conducted again in 1984 and 1993 and whatever compensatory rituals suggested at those times were also religiously carried out. In the Deva Prashna of 1993 it was divined that the sanctum sanctorum was to be rebuilt using granite stones and the roof should be paved with brass and immediately the work was taken up and what we see is the result of that. The sanctum sanctorum was built using a complex calculation known as Siddharthakam Official Address</p>
