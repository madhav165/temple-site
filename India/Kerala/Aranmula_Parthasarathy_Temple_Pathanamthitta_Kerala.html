On the ninth day of the battle of Kurukshetra the Kauravas reigned supreme under the leadership of Bheeshma when Krishna motivated Arjuna to take initiative and vanquish his foe. Bheeshma was unparalleled with the use of celestial weapons in such a manner that Arjuna could not counter the onslaught. Arrows after arrows fired from Bheeshma s bow breached the defenses of Arjuna and inflicted wounds to his body by penetrating his armour. The string of Arjuna s bow the Gandiva was snapped during the battle. Seeing Arjuna s plight Krishna jumped down in rage and took up his discus charging towards Bheeshma.
