        <h1>Patan Devi patna Bihar</h1>
        <p>Patan Devi patna Bihar Patan Devi also called Maa Patneshwari is the oldest and one of the most sacred temples of Patna. It is regarded as one of the 51 Siddha Shakti Pithas in India. According to Puranic legends the right thigh of the corpse of Devi Sati had fallen here when it was chopped off by Lord Vishnu with his Sudarshan Chakra . The ancient temple originally called Maa Sarvanand Kari Patneshwari is believed to be the abode of the goddess Durga. The name of the city Patna is widely believed to have been derived from the name of the Bari Patan Devi Temple. Some however doubt whether the name of Patna is derived from this temple. According to them the name is derived from patan which means a town and Patna was a big place of export and import. Official Address</p>
