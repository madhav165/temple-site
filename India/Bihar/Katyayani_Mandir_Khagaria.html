As per the local folk traditions Ma Katyayani is worshiped in two forms in this area. Some devotees worship Ma Katyayani as Sidh Peeth while a large number of devotees worshiped as Lok Devi- Devi of Milk Cattles. That is why devotees offer raw milk to the deity. It is said that Rishi Katyayan was performing Tapasya on the bank of river Kaushiki now Koshi when Ma Durga- the deity of Shakti took avtar in child form and was accepted by Rishi as his daughter. Hence she is called Katyayani. Another story says that around 300 years ago this place used to be dense forest. One day a devotee Shripat Maharaj saw Ma Katyayani in dream and as per her directions constructed an earthen Temple at that place and started worshiping her. In the year 1951 the temple was reconstructed. Lack of proper communication and the inaccessibility of the place by road has hampered the development of this area. Katyayani Mandir.
