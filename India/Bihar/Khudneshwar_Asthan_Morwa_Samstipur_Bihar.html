        <h1>Khudneshwar Asthan Morwa Samstipur Bihar</h1>
        <p>Khudneshwar Asthan Morwa Bihar Khudneshwar Asthan is a Hindu temple devoted to Lord Shiva located 17 kilometers southwest of the Samastipur district headquarters. The name of the temple was inherited from a Muslim woman named Khudni who found the Lingam at this location and became a devotee of Lord Shiva. Her mortal remains were buried one yard south beside the Lingam under the same temple roof.During the British Empire Narhan estate built this temple in 1858 and appointed a priest as a caretaker. Devotees flock there yearround but especially during its annual festival of Maha Shivratri and in the month of Shravan crowds emerge for darshana and worship. In 2008 Bihar Religious Trust Board Chairman Kishore Kunal provided financial assistance from the board and announced it to be developed for tourists to demonstrate Hindu-Muslim unity.
