        <h1>Nair temple Patna</h1>
        <p>The Nair temple is a ruined pillared temple at the location of Nair on the road between Patna and Gaya west of Dharawat. It is about 20 miles from Gaya. The temple consists of three rows of monolithic pillars ten pillars in each row. In the front of the temple there is a further row of four pillars. According to Thomas Fraser Pepp√© who photographed it in 1870  The temple behind consists of brick and mud cement but very little of it is now standing the superstructure is entirely gone and none of the temples of this form are sufficiently complete to allow a conjecture as to their original form. The roof of the portico and the shrine is composed of large granite slabs a linga now occupies the shrine and there is a mutilated figure of Ganesh lying outside. Judging by the size of the mound and the part of the shrine remaining the temple must have been a lofty one.. Mahavir Mandir Patna Jct Fraser Road Area Patna Bihar 800001</p>
