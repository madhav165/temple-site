They could neither maintain this temple nor provide necessary facilities to the visiting devotees and thus the condition of the temple deteriorated day by day. So much so that there were no proper arrangements for pilgrims visiting the temple during Navaratra melas. As a result the Government of Haryana took over the temple and set up the Shri Mata Mansa Devi Shrine Board SMMDSB Panchkula trust to manage the temple.
