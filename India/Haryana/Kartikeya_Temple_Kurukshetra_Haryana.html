Daksha never liked Shiva who symbolizing destruction and detachment begs for food dances in a graveyard smeared with ashes and has no possessions not even good clothes for himself. Daksha publicly insulted Shiva in a Yagna ceremony and Sati immolated Herself in anger over this treatment of Her husband. The Yagna was destroyed by the ganas of Shiva led by Virabhadra. Shiva was an ascetic and his earlier marriage was conducted with great difficulty his remarriage was out of the question. Hence Taraka believed that his boon of being killed by Shiva s son alone would give him invincibility. The Devas manage to get Shiva remarried to Parvati by having Kama the God of love awaken him from his penance incurring his wrath in the process. Shiva hands over his effulgence of the third eye used to destroy Kama to Agni as he alone is capable of handling it until it becomes the desired offspring. But even Agni tortured by its heat hands it over to Ganga who in turn deposits it in a lake in a forest of reeds shara .
