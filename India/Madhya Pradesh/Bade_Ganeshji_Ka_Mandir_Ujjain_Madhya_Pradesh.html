        <h1>Bade Ganeshji Ka Mandir Ujjain Madhya Pradesh</h1>
        <p>Bade Ganeshji Ka Mandir Ujjain Madhya Pradesh Bade Ganeshji Ka Mandir glorifies the city of Ujjain. Ganesh is considered to be the most benevolent God that blesses his followers with wealth and prosperity. He has a very sweet figure with a tusK of an elephant and is considered to be the favorite son of Parvati or Goddess Durga. It is located very near the MahaKaleshwar Temple. Bade in Hindi means large and Mandir in Hindi means a temple so the entire phrase Bade Ganeshji Ki Mandir means The Temple of the Big Ganesh Statue. This city had once been the pride of India. It was reigned by King AsoKa the great Mauryan Ruler who had an ambition for a vast Kingdom. But the War of Kalinga changed him and he was transformed into a benevolent King whose only concern was the benefit and comfort of his subjects. So he embraced Buddhism that taught the doctrine of Universal Love towards all men. Asoka was the sole individual responsible for the far reaching fame of Buddhism. After AsoKa the Mauryan King Viramaditya or Chandragupta -II came to the throne and his court was adorned by the nine gems that were specialists in nine various subjects. They were popularly Known as Navaratna. There is also a splendid temple of the MahaKaleshwar at Ujjain. It is the most sacred site of the Hindus because they worship Lord Shiva whose incarnation as MahaKal is conspicuous at that Temple. He is worshipped during the Shiva Ratri Festival before which the Kumbh Mela is held there for everytwelve years. Official Address</p>
