        <h1>Harsiddhi Temple Ujjain</h1>
        <p>This temple occupies a special place in the galaxy of ancient sacred spots of Ujjain. Seated between the idols of Mahalaxmi and Mahasaraswati the idol of Annapurna is painted in dark vermilion color. The Sri Yantra the symbol of power or shakti is also enshrined in the temple.According to the Shiva Purana when Shiva carried away the burning body of Sati from the sacrificial fire her elbow dropped at this place. There is an interesting legend in the Skanda Purana about the manner in which the Goddess Chandi acquired the epithet of Harsiddhi. Once when Shiva and Parvati were alone on Mount Kailash two demons Chand and Prachand tried to force their way in.Shiva called upon Chandi to destroy them which she did. Pleased Shiva bestowed upon her the epithet of one who vanquishes all . The temple was reconstructed during the Maratha period and the two pillars adorned with lamps are special features of Maratha art. These lamps lit during Navaratri present a glorious spectacle. There is an ancient well on the premises and an artistic pillar adorns the top of it.
