        <h1>Kakanmath Temple Morena Madhya Pradesh</h1>
        <p>Kakanmath Temple Morena Madhya Pradesh Kakanma?h is a ruined 11th century Shiva temple located at Sihoniya in Madhya Pradesh India. It was built by the Kachchhapaghataruler Kirttiraja. Only a part of the original temple complex now survives. Some of the sculptures from the site are now located at Gwalior. The temple stands on an ornate base pitha . The building includes a sanctum a vestibule and two halls gudha-mandapa and mukha-mandapa . The sanctum has a circumambulatory path with three transepts. The gudha-mandapa has lateral transepts and four clusters of pillars each cluster contains four pillars. The vestibule has four pillars in a row which are aligned with the four clusters of the gudha-mandapa. The shikhara tower of the shrine makes it around 30 m high. The steps at the entrance had two large lion statues which are now located at the entrance of the Archaeological Museum Gwalior. Many other sculptures have also been taken to Gwalior. The Kakanmath temple was commissioned by Kachchhapaghata ruler Kirttiraja r. c. 1015-1035 CE .This can be inferred from a Kachchhapaghata inscription found at the Sas-Bahu Temple in Gwalior. The inscription states that Kirttiraja built an extraordinary temple devoted to Parvati s lord Shiva at Si?hap?n?ya modern Sihoniya . According to a folk legend the temple was named Kakanmadh after Kakanavati or Kakanade who was the queen of one Surajpala. The historicity of this legend is doubtful. One possibility is that the name of the temple derives from the kanak gold and ma?ha shrine . Originally the site had a temple complex with a central temple surrounded by four subsidiary shrines. Only the ruins of the central temple stand now its outer walls balconies and a part of its spire have fallen. This damage probably happened during an earthquake.A Sanskrit-language pillar inscription dated 1 4 50 VS 1393-94 CE records the renovation of the Mahadeva temple that is Kakanmath by one Durgaprasada.A 1497 VS 1440-41 CE pillar inscription records the visit of a pilgrim named Dekhana during the reign of Dungara a Tomara ruler of Gwalior . It states that Dekhana was the son of Kakaka and a resident of Nalapuraga?ha Official Address</p>
