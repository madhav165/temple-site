It was built in the 10th century by the rulers of the Kalchuri Dynasty and dedicated to Goddess Durga along with 64 yoginis.

It is a circular temple built by Yuvaraj II of the Kalchuri dynasty. It comprises 81 yogini shrines instead of 64. Maa Narmada s presence makes it adorable.Vigras survived jihadi attacks here too.
