        <h1>Devi Jagadambi Temple Khajuraho Madhya Pradesh</h1>
        <p>Devi Jagadambi Temple Khajuraho Madhya Pradesh Devi Jagadambika temple or Jagadambika temple is one of a group of about 25 temples at Khajuraho Madhya Pradesh India. Khajuraho is a World Heritage site. The temples of Khajuraho were built by the rulers of the Chandella dynasty between the 10th and the 12th centuries. The small town of Khajuraho in the Chatarpur district is the site of dozens of Shiva Vishnu and Jain temples which were built between the 9th and 12th centuries under the aegis of the Chandella dynasty which ruled in central India. Of about 85 temples said to have been erected at this site only about twenty-five have survived. The compact temples none of which are very large stand on high plinths jagatis lifting them from their environs instead of the usual enclosure walls. The sensuous sculptures that decorate them some of which are explicitly erotic are among the masterpieces of Indian art. The sculptures have been read as relating to Tantric practices. Noted for its exquisite sculptures including several of erotic couples the Jagadambi temple dates from the mid-11th century and has a sanctuary with a passageway preceded by a hall with a porch. The outer walls are completely covered with sculptures. Rearing beasts are positioned in the wall recesses. Official Address</p>
