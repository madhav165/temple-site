Sati daughter of Mahadev s wife and Daksh was very unhappy with this and at the altar of sacrifice Sati asked the reason for not inviting Lord Shiva from her father Daksh had said a word about Lord Shiva then suffering from this humiliation Sati sat silent and turned to the north direction and took his meditation at the feet of Lord Shiva by holding the air and fire element through Yoga route consume your body with its own strength. Or when Shiva revealed the accident angry opened his third eye and destroyed the sacrifice. Then Lord Shankar lifted the body of Mother Sati on the shoulder and began to meditate in anger. For the good of the universe Lord Vishnu divided the body of Sati into fifty-two parts. Wherever the body and the ornament of Sati s body fell Shakti Peethas were formed. One of them is Shakti Peeth the temple of Mihara Devi where mother Sati s necklace fell. Meher means the mother s necklace hence the name of this place was maihar. In the next life Sati was born in the form of Parvati the house of Himachal and after receiving austerity Shiva was again found as a husband. Another interesting legend about this shrine is also prevalent. Explains that 200 years ago Maharaj Durgjan Singh used to rule the name of Judeo. A shepherd from his kingdom used to come to the forest to feed cow. In this horrible forest the day was dark as night. There were many types of scary sounds used to come. One day he noticed that a golden cow came along from those cows and came to the place suddenly after the evening. On the second day when the cowboy brought the cows on this hill then it was seen that the same cow was being eaten together with these cows. Then he decided that when this cow would return to the evening that would be followed by that too. Chasing the cow he saw that he went into the cave situated in the top of the hill and when the inside of the cave closed it closed. She sat there at the door He does not know how long after the door is open. But there he appeared to an old mother. Then the shepherd said to the old lady  Mai I feed your cow so give me something for the stomach. I have come to you from this very desire. The old mother went in and gave barley grains in a wooden soup to the shepherd and said  Now you do not come alone in this forest.  Cow is pasting in the forest but you live alone in this forest You do not feel scared. Then the old mother laughed with that shepherd and said  Son this forest high mountain-mountain is my home I reside in this house. By saying so he disappeared. When the shepherd came home and opened a barley granite he was surprised. The diamond-pearl was shining in the place of barley. He thought  I will do it. In the morning I will be present in the king s court and will tell you the past. On the second day the shepherd reached his court with his plea and narrated the whole antagonist in front of the king. Upon hearing the story of that shepherd King went to sleep in his palace asking to go there the next day. In the night the king was seen by the shepherd in a dream and the old mother appeared and realized that this is Shakti Maa Sharda. In the dream the mother ordered the Maharaja to set up an idol there and said that my vision will be fulfilled only by all the people s desires. In the morning the king did all the work as per his mother s orders. Soon the glory of this place started spreading around The devotees started coming from the other side for the blessings of the mother and their wishful desires began to be fulfilled. After this the devotees of Mata made a huge temple of Mother Sharda. Another legend is also prevalent in reference to this religious site.
