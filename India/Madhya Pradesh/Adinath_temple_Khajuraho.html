        <h1>Adinath temple Khajuraho</h1>
        <p>Considered as one of the most exquisite Jain temples in Madhya Pradesh Adinath Temple is dedicated to the Tirthankar Adinath who is believed to have founded the religion of Jainism. The temple is known for having mind-blowing carvings of Yakshis on its three bands of sculptures. The 11th-century temple depicts similarities to Khajuraho s Hindu temples and is a must visit if you are fond of history and culture. The plan and design of the Adinatha temple is similar to that of the Vamana temple. There are only a few differences between the two temples. For example the top row of the outer wall of the Adinatha temple depicts a flying vidyadhara while that of the Vamana temple shows diamond-shaped decorations. The curvilinear tower of the Adinatha temple is of better proportions than that of the Vamana temple. This combined with a somewhat more evolved sculptural style suggests that the Adinatha temple was constructed after the Vamana temple.
