        <h1>Gufa Mandir Bhopal</h1>
        <p>This temple was established by Sant Narayan Dasji Mahara. The temple was initially established inside a rock cave and for this reason this worship site dedicated to Lord Shiva is called Gufa Mandir or Temple. In the complex there is another temple dedicated to Lord Hanuman which is one of the reasons behind all the fuss about the Gufa Mandir. The Hanuman Mandir is considered as the prime source of this temple s appeal. 7.9 KM from Bhopal airport and 13 Km from Railway station Neori Mandir Rd BDA Colony Nayapura Idgah Hills Bhopal Madhya Pradesh 462001</p>
