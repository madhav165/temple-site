        <h1>Shri Dwarkadhish Gopal Mandir Ujjain</h1>
        <p>Dedicated to Lord Krishna Shri Dwarkadhish Gopal Mandir in Ujjain is a wonderful example of Maratha architecture. With two feet tall statue of Lord Krishna dressed in silver this temple speaks of grandeur blending perfectly the ethnic and modern architecture. The inner sanctum of the temple is adorned by the silver-plated door which was taken away by Mahmud Ghazni but later recovered by Mahadji Scindia. The excellent marble-spired temple offers a great visit if you are interested in history and appreciate architectural creativity. Gopal Mandir was constructed in 1844 by Bayajibai Scindia the wife of Maharajah Daulat Rao Scindia. It is a marble-crowned structure which is an excellent example of Maratha architecture. The temple has silver-plated doors. In 1026 A.D Mahmud of Ghazni had taken these doors from the famous Somnath temple in Gujarat and carried them to Ghazni in Afghanistan. Later on Mahmud Shah Abdali the Afghan invader took the gates to Lahore and from there Mahadji Scindia finally recovered these silver doors.
