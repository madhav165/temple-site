        <h1>Shri Ganesh Mandir Tekdi Nagpur</h1>
        <p>Shri Ganesh Mandir Tekdi is one of the oldest temples in the city of Nagpur and is one of the most famous too. It is dedicated to Lord Ganesha. The temple is situated at the top of a hill and thus the name of Tekdi Ganesh as tekdi in Marathi means hill. It is an extremely serene place ideal for those who like to worship in solitude away from the noise of the city. The temple is believed to be constructed over 250 years ago. The idol of Lord Ganesha s head is decorated with gold and has other silver ornaments. The devotees refer to the place as Jagruta Devasthan since pilgrims flock to the place from dawn till midnight. However we would say visit this place late afternoon-ish to witness the beautiful setting of the sun and the lush greenery along with the cool air of the hilltop. Walk to the temple is also not very hard and quite a pleasant journey to soak in the wonders of nature around you. By flight the nearest airport is the Dr Baba saheb Ambedkar International Airport. Nagpur is also well connected by rail to all major cities. Sitabuldi Nagpur Maharashtra 440001</p>
