        <h1>Trivikrama Temple Osmanabad</h1>
        <p>The Trivikrama Temple also named Ter Temple is a Hindu temple originally Buddhist in Ter Maharashtra. The temple is original in that it was initially based on a free-standing apsidal structure now located at the back of the building which is characteristic of early Buddhist apsidal caityagriha designs.The apsidal structure seems to be contemporary to the great apsidal temple found in Sirkap Taxila which is dated to 30 BCE-50 CE.It would have been built under the Satavahanas in the 2nd or 3rd century CE. The external flat-roofed mandapa structure is probably only an addition from the 6th century CE when the temple was converted into a Hindu temple. A stone image of Trivikrama probably dates to the early Chalukyas.</p>
