        <h1>Marubai temple Mumbai</h1>
        <p>Known since 1700 AD Matunga was a cluster of villages which later on were brought under a single governing umbrella by the ruling British. The area was called Marubai Tekdi Gaon which is said was shortened to MaTunGa Matunga . Marubai is the traditional Gaondevi village Goddess of Matunga whose small temple existed under a peepal tree at King s Circle. The then British Government planned to develop Bombay Mumbai . Under the provisions of the City of Bombay Improvement Act 1898 certain lands situated within the Island of Bombay were required for public purpose namely the Matunga Road Scheme now the road is known as Dr. B. R. Ambedkar Road. So the authorities then decided to shift the Marubai temple from the Kings Circle peepal tree to a different location as it came in the way of the road building plan. 022 2409 5690</p>
