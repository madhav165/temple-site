        <h1>Shri Aday Durgay Temple Sindhudurg</h1>
        <p>Shri Aday Durgay Temple is located near village Rameshwar in Devgad taluka Sindhudurg District Maharashtra India. This temple is dedicated to two Hindu goddesses Aday and Durgay. It is a historic temple that was built even before the 15th century dedicated to the Clan Goddess or Kuladevata of the Pujare Clan. The temple building is very simple in appearance. It consists of a small room elevated to a height of 4 feet. The entire temple building is only 10 feet high. The main entrance faces east. Unlike other temples in the region this temple does not have a wooden door. The temple is open to devotees all the time. The temple is located in a forest near MSH 115. Devotees have to walk for about 15-20 minutes to reach the temple from the state highway. The only access to the temple is a small stone pathway through the forest land. There are a few mango plantations around the temple premises which are owned by the local people including some Pujare.</p>
