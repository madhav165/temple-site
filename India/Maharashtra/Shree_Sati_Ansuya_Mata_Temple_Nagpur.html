Mata lived with Paradsinga villagers played song and showered enormous love and affection on them for six decades. Mata annihilated all the troubles and karma fulfilled their desires and stood as the Head of the family for each of them. Their chaste love for her is so immense that they don t requisite any other God except Mata so there is no other temple in the village. In Katol and nearby areas without offering her naivedhya nobody takes their food. Pujya Sri Sivanesan Swamiji who familiarized Mata to devotees spent his whole life in Sai Seva by Baba s grace. Swamiji channelized and gave guidance to establish Sai Organizations and follow Sai Tatva. The most incredible gift Swamiji gave to devotees is tracing of real Avadhutas without seeing them and moving from Shirdi.

Many people are now being benefited from this all across the country.
