        <h1>Kanifnath Temple Pune</h1>
        <p>Kanifnath temple is located around 30km away from Pune city at top of the hill on Saswad road. Kanifnath Temple is one of the most famous trekking place near Pune with moderate terrain level of difficulty. There are two ways to go from Magarpatta. Either go to Saswad and then toKanifnath slightly longer or go through Kondhwa Road beautiful ghat section in the middle . The map shows the second option which i think is the easier and the more scenic option. 13 Rasta Peth Pune Maharashtra 411011</p>
