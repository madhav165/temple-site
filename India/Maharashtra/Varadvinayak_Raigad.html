        <h1>Varadvinayak Raigad</h1>
        <p>Varadvinayak also spelt as Varadavinayaka is one of the Ashtavinayak temples of the Hindu deity Ganesha. It is located in Mhad village situated in Khalapur taluka near Karjat and Khopoli of Raigad District Maharashtra India. The temple was built restored by Peshwa General Ramji Mahadev Biwalkar in 1725AD. Legend has it that the childless king Bhima of Koudinyapur and his wife met the sage Vishwamitra while they had come to forest for penance. Vishwamitra gave the king a mantra incantation Ekashar Gajana Mantra to chant and thus his son and heir prince Rukmaganda was born. Rukmaganda grew up into a beautiful young prince.
