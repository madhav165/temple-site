        <p>Among the many old temples in Nasik this one is the most important one. This temple is extremely important to the Maharashtrians and most of the Indians as well. The temple depicts a story a mistake made by Lord Shiva. The legend goes that god Shiva had killed a cow by mistake once and for that he was asked by Nandi to take a holy dip in Ramkund so as cleanse himself of his bad deed. He is said to have come to Nashik and done so and post which he sat to meditate. The very spot where the temple is located is believed to be where Shiva had meditated at that time. There are many nearby temples dedicated to Lord Ganesha Gayatri Devi etc and for this reason this spot is an important one according to the local people.
