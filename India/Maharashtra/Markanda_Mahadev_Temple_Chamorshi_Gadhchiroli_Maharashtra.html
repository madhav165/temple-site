Surrounding of the fortifications of the group temples there is the temple of Dashavtar. There are 12 Pithas there are shown extra 2 Pithas here. One of the experts of culture opinioned that these extra 2 Pithas influences the minds of the people more during this period and so more of the 2 Pithas might have been constructed. There are 12 Shivlingas in the temple and courtyard of the temple. Late Dr V.V. Mirashi says that this might be the work of the man who ruled from Himalaya to Srilanka during the 11th Century. In historical texts there was no such king. On the contrary Rashtrakutas ruled during 8th Century in Vidharbha. There was a formal copper inscription of them in Chandrapur and Akola. Their capital city was Mayurkhandi which is so far undiscovered. Rashtrakuta 3rd Govinda might have constructed the temples of Markanda it is said by Dr Mirashi. In all the groups of temples might be built during 8th and 9th Century. There are seen constructions of Gajlakshmi Garud etc. on the sculptures of Markanda. There is Mahal Amgaon at 12 Km distance towards the east. In the temple there are records of Gajlakshmi and Narsimha Avatar. Nowadays our image of Garuda was found in the field. The Villagers installed the image in 2003. The image sculpture is in meditation and Anjali Mudra. The image is a wing. There is a script on a column found along a street leading to Rekhegaon. This column might be of soldiers killed in the war. The experts have read this script. The authorities of Vidarbha should save this temple.
