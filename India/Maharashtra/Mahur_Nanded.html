        <h1>Mahur Nanded</h1>
        <p>Mahur or Mahurgad is a town and religious place in Nanded district of Maharashtra India. Mahur is the birthplace of Hindu God Dattatreya. Atri Rishi and Sati Anusaya Mata lived here. Brahmadev Vishnudev and Lord Shiva once got a news about Anusaya Mata that there is no one more pious and pure as her. To test her piousness they arrived under the garb of asking Alm bhiksha . When she brought it they asked to serve them while being naked she realized by her power that she is under a test. She made them a three headed child  fed them. This became Dattatreya the unified God.</p>
