        <h1>Mini Sabarimala Mumbai</h1>
        <p>The Mini Sabarimala Temple is the first temple dedicated to the deity Ayyappa outside the state of Kerala. The temple is quite similar to the one at Sabarimala in Kerala. The temple is located on a small hillock in Kanjurmarg. There used to be a Devi and a small Ayyappa temple before the Mini Sabrimala Temple was constructed. However it was demolished by foreign invaders who also killed the temple priests. The ruins of the temples can still be witnessed to this day at the Mini Sabarimala temple. Mini Sabarimala is 9 km from Mumbai Airport. Travellers can avail bus or taxi services from the airport to reach this religious spot. Bus services are available from each corner of the state to Kanjur.</p>
