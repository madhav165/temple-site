        <h1>Shri Ramdeobaba Mandir Nagpur</h1>
        <p>Ramdeojibaba is a local folk deity of Rajasthan who worked for the welfare of society irrespective of cast and creed. Baba Ramdeoji is considered as incarnation of Lord Vishnu at Runicha in Pokhran Rajastan and around Vikram Samvat 1409 had devoted all his life to the uplift of the downtrodden. Muslims called him Pir and Hindus and other communities call him Baba. For Ram sa Pir there is no difference between a Hindu or Muslim. Ramdevbaba believed in the equality of all human beings both high and low rich and poor. He helped the down-trodden by granting them their wishes. Baba Ramdev is often depicted on horseback. His worship crosses the Hindu-Muslim divide as well as crossing the caste line since his followers include caste Hindus and the casteless dalits.
