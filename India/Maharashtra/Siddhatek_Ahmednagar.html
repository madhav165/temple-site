        <h1>Siddhatek Ahmednagar</h1>
        <p>Siddhatek is a town in the Ahmednagar district of the western part of India located on the Bhima River. The town is known for its temple to Sri Siddhi Vin?yaka the right-tusked incarnation of Ganesha as Masterful Remover . Legends surrounding the north-facing temple suggest it was built to commemorate the place where Lord Vishnu defeated the evil Asuras Madhu-Kaitabh with the blessing of Siddhi Vin?yaka. The shrine is particularly popular during the festivals of Ganesh Jayanti Vijayadashami and Somvati Amavasya</p>
