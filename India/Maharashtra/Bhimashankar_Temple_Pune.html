Chimaji Appa presented the large bell as a token of his victory against the Portuguese on 16 May 1739. According to legend a demon Tripurasura did penance in the Bhimashankar jungle ages ago in order to please Lord shiva. He hoped that by pleasing the Lord he would be given the gift of immortality. The Lord pleased by Tripurasara s devotion blessed him with immortality on the condition that Tripurasara would use his boon for the welfare of the local folk and help them. In case Tripurasara forgot his vow the Lord would be entitled to sue him in any way he deemed suitable. As time went on Tripurasara forgot all about his vow and began harassing the local folk as well as other deities. Chaos reigned and the deities approached the Lord to help them. The Lord prayed to Goddess Parvati to help him. Together in the form of ardh-narya-nateshwar  on the eve of Kartik Poornima they killed Tripurasara and the day is now known as Tripurasara Poornima. After Tripurasara s death his wives Dakini and Shakini approached lord Shiva questioning their existence without Tripurasara. The Lord blessed them both with immortality. Demon named Bhima  son of Kumbhakarna younger brother of demon king Ravana lived with his mother Karkati in the dense forest Dakini on the ranges of the Sahyadri hills. Once he got to know from his mother about his father and how Kumbhakarna was killed by the Lord Shree Ram  the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu. He had decided to take revenge and performed severe penance to please Lord Brahma. Demon Bhima was blessed with a superpower from the Lord Brahma and started using his power on Rishi Gods people etc. Once Bhima imprisoned Kamrupeshwar  the true devotee of Lord Shiva. And order to worship him in place of Lord Shiva. When Kamrupeshwar refused to do as he said Bhima raised his sword at Shivlinga. Then Lord Shiva appeared from Shivlinga and reduced him to ashes.
