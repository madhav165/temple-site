        <h1>Parasuram Parshuram Kund temple</h1>
        <p>A Hindu pilgrimage centre Parasuram Kund is situated on the Brahmaputra plateau in the lower reaches of the Lohit River and 21 km north of Tezu in Lohit district of Arunachal. Dedicated to sage warrior Parasuram the temple attracts pilgrims from Nepal from across India and nearby states of Manipur and Assam. Over 70 000 devotees and sadhus take holy dip in its water each year on the occasion of Makar Sankranti in the month of January. A dip in the sacred pond kund is believed to wash away one s sins. The legend behind the belief as found in the Kalika Purana is that the Sage Parasuram washed away the sins of killing Kshatriyas in the water of Brahma kund. Parasuram was taking revenge by massacring Kshatriyas as they killed his father and wage a battle against the Brahmins. But as a Brahmin he was not supposed to wield a sword or get into the act of fighting.</p>
