According to Hindu mythology this temple is associated with the story of Lord Shiva as the story goes Lord Shiva carried the dead body of Sati and roamed around in the sky and seeing this melancholy act Lord Mahavishnu cut the dead body into many pieces using Sudarshan Chakra. This lead the body parts to scatter all around India. You may see other prominent temples dedicated to Maa Sati.
