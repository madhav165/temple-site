        <h1>Gorsam Chorten</h1>
        <p>The largest Chorten stupa of the area is the one at Gorsam near Zemithang which is about 100-km away in the north of Tawang. Lama Pradhar a Monpa monk constructed it most probably in the early part of eighteenth century. The hemispherical dome rests upon a three-terraced plinth. Four miniature stupas are set on the four corners of the lower most terrace of the plinth. The base is square with each side about 170 feet in length with a niche running all along its whole length and 120 Manis are set in frames of wood in the niche of each of the base. A paved path goes all around for the pilgrims for circumambulation.</p>
