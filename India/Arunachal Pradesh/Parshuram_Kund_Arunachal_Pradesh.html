        <h1>Parshuram Kund Arunachal Pradesh</h1>
        <p>Parshuram Kund Arunachal Pradesh Parshuram Kund is a Hindu pilgrimage centre situated on the Brahmaputra plateau in the lower reaches of the Lohit River and 21 km north of Tezu in Lohit district of Arunachal Pradesh. Dedicated to sage Parshuram the popular site attracts pilgrims from Nepal from across India and from nearby states of Manipur and Assam. Over 70 000 devotees and sadhus take a holy dip in its water each year on the occasion of Makar Sankranti in the month of January.The site of the Parashuram Kund as established by the sadhu was in existence until the 1950 Assam earthquake that shook the whole of the North-East and the kund was completely covered. A very strong current is now flowing over the original site of the kund but massive boulders have in a mysterious way embedded themselves in a circular formation in the river bed thus forming another kund in place of the old. The nearest railway station is Tinsukia 120 km from where buses are available via Namsai. There are also buses available from Sadiya. The nearest airports are Tezu and Dibrugarh Assam .There is no railway available to Parshuram Kund as of now. A survey of 122 km Rupai-Parshuram Kund broad gauge railway line was complete at the initiative of Arunachal Chamber of Commerce and Industries while a preliminary engineering-traffic survey for the Pasighat-Tezu-Parsuram Kund was conducted by northeast frontier railways at the request of the state government Official Address</p>
