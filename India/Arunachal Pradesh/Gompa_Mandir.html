        <h1>Gompa Mandir</h1>
        <p>Centre for Buddhist Culture Gompa is located on top of a hill just above the Nehru Museum. Adorned with a beautiful gate at the base of the hill a road spiraled up the hill to the gompa. The Gompa is actually near the main road but it seemed separated from the rest of the town by this small hill  that stood out in the hill station. It is by far the most peaceful and serene place I visited in Itanagar. It is also a nice spot to view Itanagar from a higher point.   The Gompa sits on top of the hill literally. A small but colorful gate marks the entrance of the Gompa. A white stupa with golden carvings stood just outside the main Gompa and against the backdrop of green rolling hills it looked very beautiful. The main Gompa is a typical Gompa but one of the smaller ones I had seen. There was no one inside when I went there though later a monk came out of the monastery and I asked if it was ok to photograph the interior. To my surprise he was quite casual with being photographed. The location of the Gompa and the way it sat pretty on top was most remarkable. You could go around the back of the gompa and view the whole town. The peak offers a 360 degree view.  Lilabari airport in North Lakhimpur is the nearest airport to the Itanagar at a distance of about 57 kilometres. Lilabari airport receives regional Air India flights from Kolkata and Guwahati. Harmuti railway station in Assam and Naharlagun railway station in Arunachal Pradesh are the closest railway to reach Itanagar each at a distance of 34 kilometres and 15 kilometres respectively You can reach Itanagar via bus from Banderdewa North Lakhimpur Tezpur and Guwahati.</p>
