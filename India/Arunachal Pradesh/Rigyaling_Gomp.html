        <h1>Rigyaling Gomp</h1>
        <p>Rigyaling Gompa is situated at a distance of 1-km from Tawang township. The former Rigya Rinpoche constructed the gompa. After his death Changsey the secretary took charge of the gompa. The re-incarnated Rigya Rinpoche Rev. Tenzin Tsethar is presently in South-India completing his education. This gompa is surrounded by a thick covering of trees planted by Changsey under the guidance and supervision of forest department Tawang.</p>
