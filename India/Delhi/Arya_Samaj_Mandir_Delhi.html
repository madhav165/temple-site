        <h1>Arya Samaj Mandir Delhi</h1>
        <p>Founded and established by Swami Dayanand Arya Samaj Mandir in Delhi is situated on Hanuman Road in Janakpuri. Unlike other Hindu temples this shrine is a simple structure with plain walls with few posters of Swamiji pasted here and there. The temple was established only to provide a common roof to those who want to learn about the Vedas. There are no idols in the shrine and all one can hear is the melodious chanting of the mantras. The immense peace and the opportunity to learn about the ancient text make this place ever so special.</p>
