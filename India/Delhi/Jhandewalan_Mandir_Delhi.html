        <p>Dedicated to Goddess Durga this temple is built after Badri Bhagat one of the great devotees of Mother Goddess who saw an idol hidden underneath the ground at the place where the temple stands in one of his dreams. Today the exact location of the temple is the Jhandewalan Road on the way to Karol Bagh. The temple got its name from the act of people offering flags in the temple in order to get their wishes fulfilled. It is believed that the original idol of the Goddess is established safely on the ground level of the temple. On the occasion of Durga Puja and Navratra a large number of Hindu devotees throng this temple. DB Gupta Road Block E Jhandewalan Extension Paharganj New Delhi Delhi 110055</p>
