        <h1>Hanuman Mandir Delhi</h1>
        <p>It is one of the most popular Hindu temples in Delhi. The shrine is marked by the colossal 108ft statue of Lord Hanuman and can be seen from the both Jhandewalan and Karol Bagh metro station. Tuesdays are quite crowded here despite the fact that the temple stays open every day. Other than the massive effigy of Lord Hanuman which fairly does its job of attracting devotees and tourists the entrance of the temple is also an attraction. The entrance door has been carved in a shape of the mouth of the deity and one can reach the main hall of the shrine through a passageway.
