        <h1>Shri Shiv Mandir Delhi</h1>
        <p>This is the only temple of Yogmaya in Delhi and it is situated in Mehrauli. It is believed that Yogmaya was the incarnation of Lord Vishnu and she is worshipped as the Mother of all beings. It is also believed that this temple has been standing in Mehrauli for over 5000 years despite many attempts of sabotage it. During the month of October when the famous Phoolon ki Sair festival takes place in Delhi this temple comes to life. Many devotees and visitors walk from the dargah of Qutbuddin Bhaktiar Khaki in Mehrauli till the Yogmaya mandir where the floral fans and canopies are offered to the goddess Yogmaya.</p>
