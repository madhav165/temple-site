        <p>Chittaranjan Park Kali Mandir New Delhi Chittaranjan Park Kali Mandir Chittaranjan Park Kali Bari is a temple complex and Bengali community cultural center in Chittaranjan Park in New Delhi India. Built on a small hill it started as a Shiv temple in 1973 which still stands within the complex the larger shrines dedicated to goddess Kali Shiva and Radhakrishna were added in 1984. Over the years it has remained an important centre of convergence of local Bengali community during annual Durga Puja festivities. The temple also hosted its first Durga Puja in 1977 a tradition that continues to date. It was founded in 1973 on land designated by the nascent EPDP colony and a small temple to Shiva was consecrated on small hill at the edge of the colony. The tradition of Durga Puja started in 1977. Expansion of the devotee base enabled the construction of an imposing Kali temple in February 1984 in Bengal terracotta temple architecture. This was followed by two temples one for Shiva and the other for Radha-Krishna. The temples was overlaid with elaborate terracotta designs around 2006-09. The Kali Mandir is a hub of Bengali activity owing to the high density of Bengalis residing in Chittaranjan Park. Managed by the Chittaranjan Park Kali Mandir Society it organizes a number of cultural and religious events throughout the year.  Official Address</p>
