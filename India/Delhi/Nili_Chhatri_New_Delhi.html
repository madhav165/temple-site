        <h1>Nili Chhatri New Delhi</h1>
        <p>Nili Chhatri New Delhi The tomb is called Nili Chhatri due to the colour of its dome which was originally ornamented with blue caustic tiles. The tomb stands almost midway between Purana Qila and the tomb of Nizamuddin Auliya. It is built in an enclosure of several acres. Though the walls of the tomb are not extant in its entirety some portions of it can still be seen in the surrounding area. But the gateway is relatively in good shape. At the entrance of the tomb is written the inscription the letters of the inscription are of black marble inlaid on sandstone. The eyes of Time did not see in this world Such a beautiful and lofty building Of knowledge the date of its completion I asked  it replied  it has attained completion. Behind the gateway is a small building with three doors. On the back of this building is a high octagonal terrace about 6 feet 1.8 m from the ground and 79 feet 24 m in diameter. In the middle of the southern wall of the terrace there are two flights of steps on opposite sides which lead to a landing on a level with the top of the terrace. On the north-eastern and north-western corners of the terrace there are two graves of masonry and stone. On each of the four corners of the terrace are the ruins of a tower. In the center of the chabutrah is the mausoleum of Naubat Khan. It is octagonal in shape having 51 feet 16 m as its diameter and about 34 feet 10 m high. The whole of the tomb is built of stone and masonry and ornamented with encaustic tiles of four colours i.e. green blue yellow and orange. The verses from Quran can be seen in the tomb. The tomb has eight arched entrances which are about 5 feet 1.5 m wide and 7 feet 2.1 m high. Above these doorways are open arched niches. The walls of the tomb have steps. The first set of steps takes the visitor to the level of the open niches over the doorways. The second set of steps which are twelve in number leads to the top of the building. The roof of the tomb is flat but on its center there is an octagonal chabutrah about 5 feet 1.5 m high and 30 feet 9.1 m in diameter which supports another octagonal chabutrah 23 feet 7.0 m in diameter and about 2 feet 0.61 m high. This second chabutrah bears marks of eight pillars. It was on these pillars that the blue enameled dome was raised which also began to be called as Nili Chhatri. Official Address</p>
