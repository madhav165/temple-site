        <h1>Bhadrakali Temple Bijapur</h1>
        <p>The temple in the Bhadrakali village is 20kms from Bhopalpatnam. The temple is dedicated to Goddess Kali. Locals believe that the Kakatiya ruler who was a believer of Goddess Kali installed the picture here first. The place where the temple is located was a cave earlier situated within the dense forests. A large fair is held on the Vasant Panchami day and devotees from far off places of Chhattisgarh Telangana and Maharashtra visit here. Agni kund is held here where people walk through a bed of red hot coal.
