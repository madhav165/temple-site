        <h1>Sakal Narayan temple Bijapur</h1>
        <p>The Sakalnarayan hills are around 50kms from Bijapur. After crossing the 1km terrain and forest a cave can be found. It is opened to the public on Gudi Parva Ugadi. When one enters the main door of the cave many other tunnels are opened up where one can notice the statues of Lord Krishna and Sesh Nag. Usur cave and Usur waterfall along with Shankanpalli caves of Bijapur are very less explored however the places are great to visit and require immediate attention Swami Vivekananda International Airport Raipur 540 km Dantewada Junction Railway Station 140 km Pandri Bus Stop Raipur 540 km</p>
