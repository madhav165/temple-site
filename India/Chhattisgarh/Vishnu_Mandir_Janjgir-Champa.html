        <h1>Vishnu Mandir Janjgir-Champa</h1>
        <p>The Vishnu Mandir were built by kings of Hayhay Vansh near Bhima Talab of purani basti of Janjgir in 12 Century. It was being constructed in two parts to make a full temple but both the parts were not assembled in time and as a result of it both the parts of the temple are laying on the ground separately and still the temple is uncompleted. Due to this the temple is also called as Nakata Mandir by local people. On the walls of the temple the statue of God and Goddess Gandharava and Kinners are making it worth watching for the tourists.
