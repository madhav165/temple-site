        <h1>Khallari Mata Temple Mahasamund</h1>
        <p>Khallarimata temple is on the hilltop forest of Khallari village situated about 25 km South side of Mahasamund. Every year during Navratri the devotees throng to visit the Goddess and to participate in the annual fair mela scheduled on the Full Moon day of Chaitra month every year. It is believed that during the MAHABHARAT ERA the PANDAV visited this hilltop and the reason for this belief is the footprint of BHIM visible on this hill. The nearest airport is at Raipur.
