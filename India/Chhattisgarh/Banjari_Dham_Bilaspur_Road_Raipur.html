        <p>It is believed that in the place where the Banjari Mata Mandir is located today there appeared a stone in the shape of Banjari Mata s idol. Slowly people started worshipping the idol leading to a temple being constructed around it. At every Navratri here is arranged a fair for everyone and there is a school names Maa banjari mata Gurukul</p>
