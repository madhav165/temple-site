        <h1>Bhairamdev Temple Bijapur</h1>
        <p>The temple is one of the important ones in the Bijapur district and requires a lot of investigation to be done to fully discover it. The temple is located in Bhairamgarh in Bijapur and a rock cut Ardhanariswar carved on large boulders. The image belongs to 13-14th century AD. It is an incarnation of Lord Shiva believed Lord of Maa Danteswari. Within 500 meters to the temple several sculptures related to Nag Kings are found which are of historical importance. Rare image of Lord Brahma in the area proves its architectural value. Hence this excavation proves how old the monument is and requires an urgent attention to improve the condition.
