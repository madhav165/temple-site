Many Sages led by Sage Valakhilya started doing penances and worship of Lord Krishna in Kunjavana a forest on the banks of the Sharavathi river seeking the Lord s help in reducing the effects of the Kali Yuga. During the course of the worship many obstacles were encountered and thus Sage Valakhilya sought the advice of Sage Narada who advised to seek the blessings of Lord Ganesha in removing all obstacles. Sage Narada selected a site in Kunjavana which the Devatas had visited earlier. The Devatas had even created two lakes called Chakra Tirtha and Brahma Tirtha. Sage Narada and the other Sages created a new late called as Deva Tirtha. Sage Narada invited all the Devatas and requested Parvati Devi to send Lord Ganesha. Lord Ganesha was pleased with the fire sacrifice and rituals done to propitiate him and thus agreed to be present in the forest always to prevent any obstacles in the worship of the Sages. One more lake was created now to get water for the worship of Lord Ganesha and was called Ganesha Tirtha.</p>
