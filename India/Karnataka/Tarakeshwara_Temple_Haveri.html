        <h1>Tarakeshwara Temple Haveri</h1>
        <p>The name of the temple is derived from the Tarakeshwara form of Lord Shiva. Even though the credit of construction of this temple goes to the Kadambas it was the Kalyani Chalukyas that made significant changes to make it into the form we see today. The Tarakeshwara temple is a listed monument of the archeological survey of India. The nearest airport is in Hubli. The nearest railway station to the temple is the Haveri railway station which is approximately 40 kms from the temple. Once you reach the railway station there are plenty of options for road transport to take you to Hangal. Hangal has well-connected bus network to the other districts of Karnataka. The state bus standof Hangal is very near to the Tarakeshwara temple.</p>
