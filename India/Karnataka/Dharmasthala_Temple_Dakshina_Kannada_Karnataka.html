        <p>Dharmasthala Temple Dakshina Kannada Karnataka harmasthala Temple Kannada Tulu ? ? ? ? ? ? ?? ?? ??  Sanskrit ? ? ? ? ?? ?? ?? K??tra Dharmasthala is an 800-year-old religious institution in the temple town of Dharmasthala in Dakshina Kannada Karnataka India. The deities of the temple are Shiva who is referred to as Ma√±junatha Ammanavaru the tirthankara Chandraprabha and the protective gods of Jainism Kalarahu Kalarkayi Kumarasvami and Kanyakumari. The temple is considered unique since it belongs to the Shaiva sect of Hinduism. The priests are Shivalli Brahmins who are Vaishnava and the administration is run by a Jain Bunt family called the Pergades. 800 years ago Dharmasthala was known as Kuduma in Mallarmadi then a village in Belthangady. Here lived the Jain Bunt chieftain Birmanna Pergade and his wife Ammu Ballalthi in a house called Nelliadi Beedu. According to the legend the guardian angels of Dharma assumed human forms and arrived at Pergade s abode in search of a place where Dharma was being practised and could be continued and propagated. As was their habit the couple hosted these illustrious visitors with all their wherewithal and great respect. Pleased by their sincerity and generosity that night the Dharma Daivas appeared in the dreams of Pergade. They explained the purpose of their visit to him and instructed him to vacate his house for the worship of the Daivas and dedicate his life to the propagation of Dharma. Asking no questions the Pergade built himself another house and began worshiping the Daivas at Nelliadi Beedu. This worship of daivas continues. The Dharma Daivas again appeared before Pergade to build separate shrines to consecrate the four Daivas  Kalarahu Kalarkayi Kumaraswamy and Kanyakumari. Also Pergade was instructed to choose two persons of noble birth to act as the Daivas oracles and four worthy persons to assist Pergade in his duties as the executive head of the shrines. In return the Daivas promised Pergade protection for his family abundance of charity and renowned for the Kshetra . Pergade as desired built the shrines and invited Brahmin priests to perform the rituals. These priests requested Pergade to install a Shivalinga beside the native Daivas. The Daivas then sent their vassal Annappa Swamy to procure the linga of Shiva from Kadri Manjunath Temple near Mangalore. Subsequently the Manjunatha temple was built around the linga.
