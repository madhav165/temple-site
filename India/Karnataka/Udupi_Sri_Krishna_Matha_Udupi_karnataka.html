The Krishna Matha was founded by the Vaishnavite saint Jagadguru Shri Madhwacharya in the 13th century. He was the founder of the Dvaita school of Vedanta. It is believed that Madhwacharya found the murti of Sri Krishna in a large ball of gopichandana.As told by Sri Madhwacharya in his Tantrasara Sangraha the murti is placed Pashchimabhimukha facing West . All the other murtis in other Ashta mutts face west as well. Devotees always have darshan of Lord Krishna through the inner window known as Navagraha kindi  the outer window known as Kanakana kindi which is decorated by an arch named after him. A statue has also been erected. A similar window covers the immediate front of the murti and is called Navagraha kindi. It is often mistaken to be Kanakana kindi. The temple opens by 5.30 in the morning. The unique feature of the temple is that the deity is worshipped through the silver-plated window with nine holes Navagraha kindi .The temple also offers prasadam lunch in the noon. According to mythology when Lord Krishna s wife Rukmini requested her husband for the idol of Balkrishna the child form of the Lord Shri Krishna entrusted Vishwakarma with the task of designing the idol. Vishwakarma made a beautiful idol of Balkrishna with the holy saaligrama stone and gave it to Rukmini for worship.
