It is an ancient Vishnu shrine which has a statue estimated to be about 600 years old. The temple s presiding deity is Shree Vishnumurthy who is another form of Lord Vishnu.

Since there is no hard and fast documents available regarding history of its origin we could not have got any kind of legendary and chronological view in connection to the temple. However as per the opinion of Shri Gururaj Bhatt a well-known archeologist and historian in South Kanara the age of the statue dates back to 600 years. Initially there was no temple complex but Mr. Venkatramana Hebbar found a small shrine in ruining stage midst of shrubs and forest occupant around 1911.
