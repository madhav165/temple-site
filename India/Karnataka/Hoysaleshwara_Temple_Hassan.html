        <p>Halebidu temple is another great example of temple architecture the twin temples of Hoysaleshwara Kedareshwara built by Vishnuvardhana and Ballala-II at Halabidu. Sequences from Ramayana Mahabharatha  Bhagavatha are depicted on the outer walls of these temples. The efficiency and experience of the sculpture who had carved these stories in stone is bewitching.
