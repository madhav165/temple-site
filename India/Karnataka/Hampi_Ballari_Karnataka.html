The toponym Hampi traditionally known as Pampa-kshetra Kishkindha-kshetra or Bhaskara-kshetra is derived from Pampa another name of goddess in Hindu theology. According to mythology the maiden Parvati resolves to marry the loner ascetic Shiva. Her parents learn of her desire and discourage her but she pursues her desire. Shiva is lost in yogic meditation oblivious to the world Parvati appeals to the gods for help to awaken him and gain his attention. Indra sends the god Kama the Hindu god of desire erotic love attraction and affection to awake Shiva from meditation. Kama reaches Shiva and shoots an arrow of desire.Shiva opens his third eye in his forehead and burns Kama to ashes. Parvati does not lose her hope or her resolve to win over Shiva she begins to live like him and engage in the same activities asceticism yogin and tapasya awakening him and attracting his interest. Shiva meets Parvati in disguised form and tries to discourage her telling her Shiva s weaknesses and personality problems.Parvati refuses to listen and insists in her resolve. Shiva finally accepts her and they get married.According to Sthala Purana Parvati Pampa pursued her ascetic yogini lifestyle on Hemakuta Hill now a part of Hampi to win and bring ascetic Shiva back into householder life. Shiva is also called Pampapati lit. husband of Pampa .The river near the Hemakuta Hill came to be known as Pampa river.The Sanskrit word Pampa morphed into the Kannada word Hampa and the place Parvati pursued Shiva came to be known as Hampe or Hampi. The site was an early medieval era pilgrimage place known as Pampakshetra. Its fame came from the Kishkindha chapters of the Hindu epic Ramayana where Rama and Lakshmana meet Hanuman Sugriva and the monkey army in their search for kidnapped Sita.
