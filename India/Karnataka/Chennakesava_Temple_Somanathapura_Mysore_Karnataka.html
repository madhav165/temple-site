The temple was consecrated in 1258 CE by Somanatha Dandanayaka a general of the Hoysala King Narasimha III. It is located 38 kilometres 24 mi east of Mysuru city. The ornate temple is a model illustration of the Hoysala architecture. The temple is enclosed in a courtyard with a pillared corridor of small shrines damaged . The main temple in the center is on a high star-shaped platform with three symmetrical sanctums garbha-griha  set in a square matrix 89 x 89  oriented along the east-west and north-south axes. 3 The western sanctum was for a statue of Kesava missing  the northern sanctum of Janardhana and the southern sanctum of Venugopala all forms of Vishnu. The sanctums share a common community hall sabha-mandapa with many pillars. The outer walls the inner walls the pillars and the ceiling of the temple are intricately carved with theological iconography of Hinduism and display extensive friezes of Hindu texts such as the Ramayana southern section  the Mahabharata northern section and the Bhagavata Purana western section of the main temple . The Chennakesava temple states George Michell represents the climax of the development in Hoysala temple style and yet is also unique in many ways. The northern and southern row of small shrines inside the pillared courtyard corridor consists of eighteen single shrine and one linked-double shrine each. The linked-double shrine is at the northwestern and southwestern corners of the courtyard. The western row consists of fourteen small shrines while the eastern row consists of eight single small shrines and two linked-double shrines. In total the Kesava temple consists of 58 small 1 1 small shrines 4 small 2 1 linked-double shrines 2 near entrance and the main central temple.The 64 corridor shrines once featured Vedic and Puranic deities and rooms for pilgrims. The statues in the smaller shrines were defaced their limbs broken or destroyed. Some of the recovered broken pieces are in a heap inside the temple. The collection includes Jaina statues in the Kayotsarga posture as well as numerous Hindu statues. The ceiling of the southern array of shrines has carvings on its ceiling the western does not and it have an repair related inscription instead from Vijayanagara Empire era. The northern array also mostly lacks any ceiling art work except near the stairs in the middle while the eastern array shows the greatest signs of damage and restoration with most small shrines missing but for signs of their foundation. The main temple is built on a jagati which symbolizes worldly platform. It is about 3 feet high star-shaped and has stone steps at its east end for the visitor to climb up to it. Near the stairs on each side are two dvarapala guardian shrines but these are damaged. The platform around the temple serves as the circumambulation passage. The raised jagati platform circles around the main temple with a broad walking space. It is the pradakshina patha circumambulation path  and is supposed to be walked in a clockwise manner in order to pictorially read the Ramayana Mahabharata and Bhagavata Puranalegends in the correct sequence.The eastern side of the platform is rectangular while the space below the vimana temple tower mirrors the pointed star tower shape with nine points on each side and two linking edges a total of 29 . A stone elephant originally stood at each star point end of the platform but only 11 of the 15 original have survived in a damaged condition. On the sides of the star side and where two stars of the jagati platform meet were 14 mid size images likely of Nagas and 58 images of Yakshas but all of this are now missing. The temple premises stores 7 of the broken pieces found in the early 20th century. The platform appears from distance to be five stacks from the careful moulding. From the jagati level there are four stone steps that leads the devotee into the temple s sabha mandapa inside.The hall appears to be rectangular yet consists of two fused squares and a rectangle. A small square is at the entrance the largest square in the middle and a rectangle facing the three sanctum garbha griya  all supported by intricately carved pillars. The main hall opens to each sanctum through a small square shaped puja mandapa. The three sanctums house Keshava image lost  Janardhana and Venugopala. Above each of these sanctums rise the 16 pointed star shaped North Indian style tower shikara . Wall panel relief and molding frieze around the main Kesava Temple The outer wall of the main temple consists of parallel horizontal bands of artwork carved above the circumambulatory platform.It has three major section the basement band the wall band and the top band. The lowest band in the basement section is about 6 inches tall and shows a row of elephants mostly marching to the left in the clockwise direction the devotee is expected to walk. The elephants are not exact copy of each other rather show different natural expressions and playfulness of elephants.Some show elephants in war throwing enemies while others show them teasing the riders in front. The band above the elephants is of horses with armed riders depicting a military march. In some spots camels substitute for horses suggesting that the Hoysala had adopted camels into their army. Some spots also show battle scene with horses. In various places the artists added humor by placing dwarfs and monkeys supporting the front raised leg of the horses. The band above the horsemen friezes is a scroll of nature. It shows flowers fruits occasionally some peacocks and wildlife. The band above it is the mythology frieze. It is about 7 inches tall around 2.5 feet above the platform and it depicts the legends and spiritual stories found in the Ramayana up to face 5  the Puranas particularly the Bhagavata Purana from face 6 to 11 and lastly the Mahabharata.There are numerous panels around the temple that tell the various Hindu fables and stories.

In addition to this temple Somanatha consecrated a Shaivism tradition related Panchalinga temple literally  five linga temple  in the east-northeast corner of the land grant. He also built a fort wall around the land but these are now in ruins.According to the inscriptions and textual evidence Somanatha additionally built the Purahara Narasimhesvara Murahara Lakshminarasimha and Yoganarayana temples in Hoysala style in the region but all these temples except the Lakshminarasimha have disappeared after wars between the Hindu kingdoms and Muslim Sultanates ravaged the region. The Lakshminarasimha temple is also in ruins. From the other disappeared temples the sanctum image of Yoganarayana temple is only known surviving artwork but it too is in a damaged form. The Kesava temple too was badly damaged according to 15th-century inscriptions. It was repaired in the 16th century with financial support and grants by the emperors of the Vijayanagara Empire.The repairs are evidenced by the different color of stones and quality of work in the veranda and parts of the northern tower and platform of the main temple. The repaired temple was damaged in the 19th century then repaired again in the early 20th century by the colonial era Mysore government. A part of the inscription stone at Keshava temple entrance.
