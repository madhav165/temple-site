        <p>Badami cave temples Badami Karnataka The Badami cave temples are a complex of four Hindu a Jain and possibly Buddhist cave temples located in Badami a town in the Bagalkot district in northern part of Karnataka India. The caves are considered an example of Indian rock-cut architecture especially Badami Chalukya architecture which dates from the 6th century. Badami was previously known as Vataapi Badami the capital of the early Chalukya dynasty which ruled much of Karnataka from the 6th to the 8th century. Badami is situated on the west bank of a man made lake ringed by an earthen wall with stone steps it is surrounded on the north and south by forts built in later times. The Badami cave temples represent some of the earliest known examples of Hindu temples in the Deccan region. They along with the temples in Aihole transformed the Malaprabha River valley into a cradle of temple architecture that influenced the components of later Hindu temples elsewhere in India. Caves 1 to 4 are in the escarpment of the hill in soft Badami sandstone formation to the south-east of the town. In Cave 1 among various sculptures of Hindu divinities and themes a prominent carving is of the Tandava-dancing Shiva as Nataraja. Cave 2 is mostly similar to Cave 1 in terms of its layout and dimensions featuring Hindu subjects of which the relief of Vishnu as Trivikrama is the largest. The largest cave is Cave 3 featuring Vishnu-related mythology and it is also the most intricately carved cave in the complex. Cave 4 is dedicated to revered figures of Jainism. Around the lake Badami has additional caves of which one may be a Buddhist cave. Another cave was discovered in 2015 about 500 metres 1 600 ft from the four main caves with 27 Hindu carvings.  The Badami cave temples are located in the town of Badami in the north-central part of Karnataka India. The temples are about 88 miles 142 km east of Belgavi IATA Code IXT  and 87 miles 140 km northwest of Hampi. The Malaprabha River is 3 miles 4.8 km away.
