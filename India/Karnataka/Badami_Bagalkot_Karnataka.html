        <h1>Badami Bagalkot Karnataka</h1>
        <p>Badami Bagalkot Karnataka  The Puranas state the wicked asura Vatapi was killed by sage Agastya and it refers to this area as Vatapi and Agastya Tirtha. In the Ramayana Agastya and Lopamudra are described as living in Dandaka forest on the southern slopes of Vindhya mountains. Rama praises Agastya as the one who can do what gods find impossible. He is described as the sage who used his Dharma powers to kill demons Vatapi and Ilwala after they had jointly misled and destroyed 9 000 men. In the Mahabharata sage Agastya is described in the epic as a sage with enormous powers of ingestion and digestion. To kill men asura Vatapi used to become a goat and his brother Ilvala would cook him. Then Vatapi would recollect in the stomach and tear himself out from the inside of the victim killing the victim. When Agastya arrives Ilvala offers the goat again. He kills Vatapi by digesting the meal as soon as he ate giving Vatapi no time to self organize.Agastya in the legends of Mahabharata kills the demons Vatapi and Ilvala much the same mythical way as in the Ramayana. Badami Chalukyas was founded in AD 540by Pulakeshin I AD 535 566  an early ruler of the Chalukyas is generally regarded as the founder of the Early Chalukya line. An inscription record of this king engraved on a boulder in Badami records the fortification of the hill above Vatapi in 544. Pulakeshin s choice of this location for his capital was no doubt dedicated by strategic considerations since Badami is protected on three sides by rugged sandstone cliffs. His sons Kirtivarman I AD 567 598 and his brother Mangalesha AD 598 610 constructed the cave temples.Kirtivarman I strengthened Vatapi and had three sons Pulakeshin II Vishnuvardhana and Buddhavarasa who at his death were minors thus making them ineligible to rule so Kirtivarman I s brother Mangalesha took the throne and tried to establish rule only to be killed by Pulakeshin II who ruled between AD 610 to 642. 5 Vatapi was the capital of the Early Chalukyas who ruled much of Karnataka Maharashtra parts of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh between the 6th and 8th centuries. The greatest among them was Pulakeshin II AD 610 642 who defeated many kings including the Pallavas of Kanchipuram.And was later killed by Narasimha Pallavi 1 in the famous battle of vatapi Old Kannada inscription of Chalukya King Mangalesha dated 578 CE at Badami cave temple no.3 The rock-cut Badami Cave Temples were sculpted mostly between the 6th and 8th centuries.
