        <h1>Hasanamba Temple Hassan</h1>
        <p>The main tower at Sri Hasanamba has been newly constructed in Dravidian style. There are three major temples on the premises of this temple dedicated to Darbar Ganapati Hasanamba and Siddeshwara. Another prominent attraction here is the shrine dedicated to Kallappa. The three idols installed here are said to be of three thieves who had allegedly come to steal the idol of the presiding deity Sri Hasanamba and earned her wrath. Earlier Hassan was known as Sihmasanapuri and later it got the name of Hassan. It is said that during the rule of Hoysala dynasty in twelfth century A.D. an idol was found with its face wearing a pleasant smile. Hasana Mukhi or a smiling face was transformed into Hassan. The Hasanamba temple is opened in the presence of the Deputy Commission for only twelve days in a year during Deepavali celebrations. The special feature of this temple is that the lamp lit this year will be alive till the temple is reopened next year. Even the flowers retain their freshness for the entire year. Devotees from across south India and Maharashtra visit the temple.
