        <p>Dharmaraya Swamy Temple  Bengaluru Karnataka  When we look at the history of the temple it is believed that the temple was constructed by the Ganga Arasu people. These people also known as Vanhi Kula Kshatriyas or Thigalas The Archeology survey department which has undertaken a study of the stone and masonry has concluded that this temple is about 800 years old. It is also learnt that when Bangalore city was built by Kempe Gowda in the 16th century the Kempegowda Gopuras towers were built in the four corners of the city keeping the Sri Dharmarayaswamy Temple vimanagopura kalasa as a centre point. The four towers are the Ulsoor tower in the North-East The Bellary Road Tower in the North-West The Lalbagh Tower in the South-East The Gavipura Tower in the South-West. The Gonga Arasu or Ganga Arasu kings used to build their towns near lakes or river beds and also built their temples at a lower level to the ground with a further lower level pradakshina patha. Sri Dharmaraya Swamy temple was built in the Sidhikatte lake bed area  it is below the land level that existed prior to current Bangalore. It is also learnt that this old town was called as Kalyanapuri a Town of Temples Ponds  Religious centres. Later it was named as Bendhakaluru and then as Bengaluru .  The temple resembles the architectural features of the Gangas the Pallavas and the Vijayanagara styles. The garbhagruha is in Ganga style the vimanagopura is in Pallava style and the mukhamantapa is in Vijayanagar style which shows the development of this temple in three different ages. The fourth stage of development of rajagopura and sabhangana was taken up in the 20th century. The earlier rajagopura was built well before Kempe gowda founded Bangalore in the year 1530 A.D. Kempe Gowda was an ardent devotee of this temple. Bangalore city was designed keeping this temple as its reference. The temple area was developed as Halasuru pete.
