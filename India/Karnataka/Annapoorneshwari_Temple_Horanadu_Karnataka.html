To prove food is not illusion Parvati disappeared resulting in the nature to become still. Neither climate changed nor plants grew causing drought in the world. Taking pity on the world Parvati appeared and distributed food to all. According to another tale Shiva beheaded the god Brahma. Brahma s skull got stuck in Shiva s hand. He was cursed that till the skull is not full of food or grains it will stick to his hands. Shiva went everywhere and asked for food but the skull was never full. So he finally went to this temple and Annapoorna filled the skull with grains and reversed Shiva s curse. Official Address</p>
