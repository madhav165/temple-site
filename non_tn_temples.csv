The temple is situated in the Gara mandal of the Srikakulam district, which is located at a distance of 130 kilometres (81 mi) from Visakhapatnam. Considered the only Indian temple where the Hindu deity Vishnu is worshipped in the form of a tortoise, Srikurmam is 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) away from Srikakulam town and 3.5 kilometres (2.2 mi) away from the Suryanarayana temple, Arasavalli. Believed to have been built before the 2nd century AD,the temple is popular among the Tamil diaspora as well because it is a Vaishnavite temple. Initially dedicated to Shiva and referred to as Kurmeswara temple, Ramanuja is said to have converted Srikurmam into a Vaishnavite temple in the 11th century AD.His disciples established Vaishnavism in the temple with the support of Kalinga king Anantavarman Chodaganga, the eastern Ganga king.After this incident, a group of devadasis were employed to sing and dance daily before the deity in the morning and evening.

One story of the site’s origin is as follows: The sage Agastya wanted to build a temple for Lord Venkateswara on this site. However, the statue that was made could not be installed as the toe nail of the idol got broken. The sage was upset over this and performed a penance for Shiva. When Shiva appeared, he said the place suits Shiva better as it resembles Kailash. Agastya then requested Shiva to give the devotees a Parvathi Goddess as Lord Uma Maheswara in a single stone, which Shiva obliged.A second story is as follows: Chitteppa, a devotee of Shiva, was worshiping Shiva and Shiva appeared to him as a tiger. Chitteppa understood that it was Lord Shiva in tiger form, and shouted Neganti Shivanu ne kanti (meaning: I saw Shiva I saw), and danced with joy. There is a cave called Chitteppa nearby. Sri Yaganti Uma Maheswara Temple is one of the few temples patronized by one of the great dynasties of India. Every year Maha Shivaratri is celebrated and a large number of devotees from all over Andhra Pradesh visit. Shiva, Parvati and Nandi are the main deities in this temple.This temple is 14 km away from Banaganipalli in kurnool dt.

Though a small village, historically it is very important, because it has a beautiful Siva Temple which is popularly known as “the Parasurameswara Temple.”The main importance of the temple lies in the Linga which is housed in the Garbhagriha of the temple and considered unique for its naturalistic depection. This is supposed to be the earliest Linga discovered so far and it has been assigned to the 3rd century BCE. The name of the temple is mentioned as Parasurameswara Temple in the inscriptions. These inscriptions do not refer to the original builders of the temple. But they register the gifts made to the temple like land, money and cows for the conduct of daily worship in the temple. The Black and Redware sherds of the 2nd or 3rd century AD have been brought to light during the course of excavations conducted in 1973. Potsherds of the Andhra Satavahana period (Circa 1st century AD to 2nd century AD) and large sized bricks measuring 42x21x6 inches of the same period have also been found. Hence some historians assign the temple to the Satavahana period.

The Shri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha temple, Simhachalam is a Hindu temple situated on the Simhachalam hill, which is 500 metres above the sea level in the north of Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. It is dedicated to one of the Hindu trinity deitiesVishnu, who is worshipped there as Varaha Narasimha. As per the temple’s legend (which is divided into 32 chapters), Vishnu manifested in this peculiar form, with a boar head, human torso and a lion’s tail, after saving his devotee Prahlada from a murder attempt by the latter’s father Hiranyakashipu. Except on Akshaya Tritiya, the idol of Varaha Narasimha is covered with sandalwood paste throughout the year, which makes it resemble a Shiva Lingam.
Simhachalam is one of the 32 Narasimha temples in Andhra Pradesh which are important pilgrimage centres. It was regarded as an important centre of Vaishnavism in the medieval period along with Srikurmam and others. The temple has been recognised by historians with the help of a 9th-century AD inscription by the Chalukya Chola king Kulottunga I. In the later half of the 13th century, the temple complex underwent radical physical changes during the reign of the Eastern Ganga king Narasimhadeva I. It later received patronage from many royal families, of which Tuluva dynasty of Vijayanagara Empire is a notable one. The temple underwent 40 years of religious inactivity from 1564 AD to 1604 AD. In 1949, the temple came under the purview of the state government and is currently administered by the Simhachalam Devasthanam Board.
Simhachalam temple resembles a fortress from outside with three outer courtyards and five gateways. The architecture is a mixture of the styles of the Kalinga Architecture/Odishan(Orissan), Chalukyas and the Cholas. The temple faces west instead of east, signifying victory. There are two temple tanks: Swami Pushkarini near the temple and Gangadhara at the bottom of the hill. The temple houses a number of sub-shrines and a few mandapams. The religious practices and customs of the temple are formulated by the Vaishnavite philosopher Ramanuja. They are modelled based on the Satvata Samhita, one of the 108 texts of the Pancharatra Agama.
Simhachalam is the second-largest after Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh in terms of income earned. It is believed that the deity is capable of giving progeny to women and fulfilling wishes of devotees. Kalyanotsava and Chandanotsava are the two major festivals celebrated in the temple, followed by Narasimha Jayanti, Navaratrotsava and Kamadahana. The festivals celebrated in Simhachalam have an influence of the Dravida Sampradaya, the customs followed in Tamil Nadu. Apart from those by well known poets, the temple found many literary references and lyrical works dedicated by anonymous writers which are preserved in the Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, Chennai.

Vayu is incarnated as Lord Shiva and worshipped as Kalahasteeswara. Goddess Parvathi Devi is worshiped here as Gnanaparasunambikai. It is one of the most famous Shiva temples in South India, and is said to be the site where Kannappa, one of the 63 Saivite Nayanmars, was ready to offer both his eyes to cover blood flowing from the Siva Linga before the Lord Siva stopped him and granted him Mukthi. The inner temple was constructed around 5th century and the outer temple was constructed in the 12th century by the Chola Kings and the Vijaya Nagara kings.
The Shivalinga at Sri Kalahasti is marked by symbols of three creatures — that of a spider at the bottom, a five-hooded snake on top and elephant-tusks on either side. Legend informs us that Sri (spider), Kala (snake) and Hasti (elephant) were cursed by Brahma, Shiva and Parvati but attained moksha by worshipping Lord Shiva here. Hence Shiva came to be called Sri Kalahasteeswara. It is one of the shrines of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams – Shiva Sthalams glorified in the early medieval Thevaram poems by Tamil Saivite Nayanar Sundarar.
This is one of the 276 Devara Paadal Petra Shiva Sthalams and 19th Shiva Sthalam in Thondai Nadu. A lamp burns inside the inner sanctum that constantly flickers despite the lack of air movement inside. Kalahasti is located near the pilgrimage town of Tirupati and is visited by thousands of pilgrims. The river Swarnamukhi takes the northerly course at Sri Kalahasthi almost washing the west wall of the famous Sri Kalahasthi temple. The temple architecture is a treat to the eyes for all those who visit Srikalahasthi.
 
The temple remains open from 5.00 a.m. to 12.00 a.m. and 5.00 p.m. to 9.00 p.m.
Thousands of pilgrims visit this temple to have darshan of the almighty Sri Kalahasteeswara and Sri Gnanaparasunambikai Devi. Sri Kalahasteeswara showers grace to wipe out the sins and obstacles of devotees. Worshipping Sri Kalahasteeswara results in dispelling all worldly miseries and attaining marvelous spiritual happiness. Goddess Gnanaparasunambikai Devi received the Panchakshara mantra from the Lord himself. The Goddess arrived at the place and started her penance here.
Of the nine planets, Kalahasthi importance is attached to Rahu and Ketu (Dragon’s tail and head respectively) those afflicted with the adverse effects of these planets and problems related to snakes, pray for relief here. After fulfillment of the prayers, devotees perform Abhishek to the Lord, offer Vastras (clothes) and also offer donation for the maintenance of the temple depending on their affordability.
Shri Kalahasteeswara Swamy temple is reputed as the Rahu Kethu Kshetra. People who have Rahu Kethu Doshas and Sarpa Doshas, the unmarried, those with children and those who are facing various problems for long period, perform the most effective Rahu – Kethu Sarpa Dosha Nivarana pooja in this temple all, it is believed that the Doshas get removed and desired results occur. Thousands of devotees from the country and abroad perform this pooja and fulfill their vows continuously, after receiving good results.
The temple follows Saivite tradition. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasanthi at 6:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 11:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m and Sayarakshai between 7:45 – 8:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: Alankaram (decoration), neivedhyam (food offering) and Deepa aradhanai (waving of lamps) for both Srikalahasteeswara and Gnana Prasunambika. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 6am – 12 pm and 4-8:30 pm.
Kalahasthi temple is closely attached with the history of Kannappar, whose bhakti (devotion) is yet to be equaled in the history of the religious literature of Tamilnadu. Acharya Shankara had devoted a verse in praise of Kannappar in his celebrated Shivanandalahari. Sekkizhar, in his Periyapuranam elaborately sings the greatness of Kannappar in 185 verses. Kannappar performed abishek to the Lord bringing water from the Swarnamukhi river in his mouth. Vibhuti Prasad is not offered in this temple, but symbolizing the Abishek Theertha of Kannappar, only Theertha Prasad (water) is offered to the devotees mixed with Pachai Karpooram. It is offered through a conch.
The Vibhuti (sacred ash) brought by the devotees are placed at the feet of the Lord, an Arati is offered and returned to the devotee. Abishek is performed to the Lord only with water mixed with Pachai Karpooram. Other Abisheks are offered only to the stage (called Avudayar – the Linga Peetam). As the Shrine is related to Rahu-Ketu planets, devotees do the Pradikshina in an anti-clockwise way. As sage Bharadhwaja performed penance here, only those belonging to the Bharadhwaja Gotra are appointed as archakas in the temple.
The Kavacham covering the Lord has the symbols of the planets, hence there is no separate shrine for the Navagrahas except for Saturn. Garlands are not offered on the body of Lord. An Angi – upper cloth – is placed on the Lord on which Thumba Flower Garland is placed. In the Oddiyanam (belt made of gold studded with pearls and precious stones), of Mother Gnanaparasunambikai, the symbol of planet Kethu is carved. There is a temple for Lord Manikandeswarar on the slopes of the hill through which Kannappar went on the hill taking his Abishek Water from Ponmuhali river.
There is also a mandap called Manikarnika Gattam near this temple carved out of the hill. The story goes that it is here Lord Shiva uttered the Tharaka Mantra to a woman (commonly known as Karna Manthra being uttered on the ears of the departing soul) as Lord Viswanatha did in Kasi – Varanasi to a devotee. Following this tradition, devotees use to bring those nearing their end to Manikarnika Gattam and place them lying here so that the last breath may leave the mortal body through the right ear. Procession of Lord is taken from the North tower entrance. As Maharishis worshipped the Lord facing the east after a dip in the Ponmuhali river, Lord Kalathiappar is facing west to bless the Rishis.
Maha Shivaratri is the most important festival when lakhs of devotees offer prayers to seek the blessings of the Lord. Mahasivarathri Brahmotsavams are celebrated in par with Maha Shivaratri for 13 days during which the Utsava Murtis of Siva and Parvati will be taken on Vahanams in a procession around the temple streets. The fifth day of the festival in the month of Maasi coincides with the Maha Shivaratri. Mahasivarathri, Nandi Seva, Lingodbhavam, Rathotsavam, Theppotsavam and Swami-Ammavarla Kalyanotsavam are the important aspects of this festival. Shivaratri, Vinayaka Chaturthi, Vijayadasami, Thirukarthigai in November-December, Oonjal festival on all Fridays, Makara Sankaranthi (Pongal) in January and Giri Valam on Shivarathri day are the other important festivals celebrated here.
9-30 PM (on Saturday to Monday)
Srikalahasthi:
Srikalahasthi is named after Sri (spider) Kala (Snake) Hasti (Elephant). They were staunch devotees of Lord Shiva. According to Hindu mythology, the elephant or Hasti used to clean the Shiva deity by watering the idol with the help of river-water carried in his trunks and pray for him by placing Vilva leaves. The spider or Sri tried to protect the deity from external damage by weaving his web and to provide shelter for the Shiva lingam. The snake or Kala used to place its precious gem on the Linga to adorn the lord. In this way, they all worshipped the Vayu Linga separately without knowing what the other was doing.
One day, the spider had built a very big and thick web around the deity to protect it from dust and weather while the snake places its gem. The elephant not knowing this and assuming that this form of puja by Sri and Kala is a desecration by the seeming miscreants, pours water on it and cleans it up. This causes a war between the three. The snake punishes the elephant by entering its trunk and in the process, kills itself while the elephant runs amok and hits its trunk and head against the Shiva Linga.
During this struggle, the spider is squashed against the Linga by the elephant’s trunk and the elephant dies due to the snake’s poison. Lord Shiva then appeared and gave moksha to all three of them for their selfless devotion. The spider takes rebirth as a great king while the elephant and the snake reaches heaven for satisfying all its karma. This king continues his good work from his previous birth and builds a variety of temples that seeks to protect the underlying deity with tons of stones.
It is interesting to note that all his temples, keep the deity beyond the access of an elephant. In this temple, access to the deity is through a narrow passage in the side of the building that prevents an elephant from extending its trunk over the lord from any side. This temple is considered as the Kailash of the South or Dakshina Kailasam. At the foot of the Linga one can see a spider, two elephant tusks and a five-headed (the five elements) serpent to remind the devotee of these acts of supreme devotion. The legend here is similar to that of the Jambukeswarar temple at Tiruvanaikkaa.
Vayu Lingam:
During the early days of creation, Lord Vayu performed penance for thousands of years to “Karpoora Lingam” (Karpooram means camphor). Pleased with his penance, Lord Shiva manifested before him and said, ” O Vayu Deva! Though you are dynamic in nature, you stayed here without movement and did penance for me. I’m pleased with your devotion. I shall grant you three boons”. Lord Vayu said, “Swami! I want to be present everywhere in this world. I want to be an integral part of every Jiva who is none other than the manifestation of Paramatma. I want to name this Karpoora Linga, which represents you, after me.
Samba Siva said,” You are qualified for these three boons. As per your wish, you will be spread throughout this world. Without you there will be no life. This Linga of mine will forever be known all over through your name, and all Suras, Asuras, Garuda, Gandharvas, Kinnaras, Kimpurushas, Siddhas, Saadhvis, humans and others will worship this Lingam”. Lord Shiva disappeared after granting these boons. Thereafter, this Karpoora Vayu Lingam is worshipped by all Lokas (worlds).
Gnana Prasunambika Devi:
Once, Parvati was cursed by Lord Shiva to discard her heavenly body and assume the human form. To get rid of the above curse Parvati did a long penance here. Pleased with her deep devotion Lord Shiva again recreated her body – a hundred times better than her previous heavenly body and initiated various mantras including the Panchakshari. Consequent to this, Parvati gained fame and came to be known as Shiva-Gnanam Gnana Prasunamba or Gnana Prasunambika Devi.
Ghanakala prayed to Lord Shiva here:
Cursed to become a ghost, Ghanakala prayed at Srikalahasthi for 15 years and after chanting the Bhairava Mantra many times Lord Shiva restored her original form.
Mayura, Chandra and Devendra prayed to Lord Shiva here:
Mayura, Chandra and Devendra were also freed from their curses after taking bath in the river Swarnamukhi and praying at Srikalahasthi.
Lord Shiva preached to Sage Markandeya here:
To Markandeya, Lord Shiva appeared in Srikalahasthi and preached that a Guru alone could make esoteric teachings and, therefore he is Brahma, Vishnu and Maheswara.
Legends of Kannappa Nayanar:
Kannappa Nayanar was an enthusiastic devotee of Lord Shiva and a hunter by profession. It is believed that once, he saw blood coming out of the eyes of the Lord Shiva. Kannappa plucked out one of his eyes and placed in the eye of Linga which was oozing with blood and tears. When the tears and the blood were still trickling from another eye, Kannappa decided to remove his second eye and placed one of his feet on the spot of the right eye of the Shiva Linga. Before he could pull out his second eye with the arrow, Lord Shiva appeared and restored his eye and for this reason earned the name Kannappan (his original name being Thinnan) and the distinction of having his statue adorn the sanctum. This act of Kannappa placed him among the 63 Nayanmars.
At Sri Kalahasthi, Lord Shiva tested the unshakable devotion of Kannappa Nayanar before the sages gathered at Srikalahasthi. With his divine power, Lord Shiva created a tremor and the roof tops of the temple began to fall. All the sages ran away from the scene except Kannappa who covered the Linga with his body to prevent it from any damage.
According to Swami Sivananda’s book, Sixty-Three Nayanar Saints, some Saivite traditions believe that Kannappa was the reincarnation of Arjuna. Arjuna, worshipped Siva for seeking the Pasupatha Astra and failed to recognize him in the form of a hunter. Thus, according to this tradition, Arjuna had to be born as a hunter and adore the Lord before attaining final liberation.
Flickering Flame in the Hanging Lamp at Sanctum:
In the sanctum sanctorum of this temple is a hanging lamp that always keeps swinging with a flickering flame though there is no visible inlet for wind. No one knows where the wind comes from is a mystery.

Lord Shiva has 5 faces; Isanam, Thatpurusham, Vaamadevam, Sathyojaatham and Agoram. There are 5 ancient Shiva temples on the banks of Kosasthalaiyar (Brahmaranya River) representing the 5 faces of Lord Shiva and this is one of them representing the Tatpurusha face of Lord Shiva.
This temple built by Vijayanagara emperor Vidhyaranyar was in a dilapidated state but now it has been renovated beautifully. Kanchipuram Sankara Paramacharya is considered to have spent lot of time here meditating and he is the person who traced this place to Ramayana period findings. This temple was one of the favorites of the Paramacharya, who stayed here for 10 days, and in whose memory a Dhyana Mandapam was constructed. Sri Jayendra Saraswathi and Sri Vijayendra Saraswathi performed the Kumbabhishekam of the temple on June 23, 2002.
The Temple remains open from 06.00 a.m. to 12.30 p.m and 04.00 p.m. to 08.00 p.m.
Shivarathri in February-March, Aipasi Annabishekam in October-November and Tiruvadhirai in December-January are the festivals of the temple. Pradosham days morning 6.00 a.m. to 8.30 p.m. Sani Pradosham is especially important when about 15,000 devotees throng this temple. On the occasion of Maha Shivaratri well over 30,000 devotees wait for the darshan of Pallikondeswarar.
Surutapalli is the place, where Pradosha puja first began. If devotees worship Pallikonda Easwara, who swallowed the venom to save the world on Pradosha day falling on a Saturday, they will recover the losses. Those demoted will be reinstalled in their proper position again with promotion too. Obstacles in wedding proposals will not occur. Separated couples will see re-union in life. Realizing their wishes, devotees perform archanas to Lord Shiva with Vilwa garlands.
 
Origin of Pradosham:
Once Indra, the King of Gods, while riding on his white elephant Iravadha came across Sage Durvasa who offered him a special garland. Indra accepted the garland but without giving much importance he gave it to his elephant. Iravadha was irritated by the smell of the flowers in the garland and therefore threw the garland on the floor and stamped on it. This act enraged sage Durvasa as he got the garland from “Sridevi” as prasadam. Immediately Durvasa cursed Indra and all devas to be bereft of all strength, energy, and fortune.
Due to this curse, in the battles that followed Devas were defeated and Asuras led by Mahabali Chakravarthy, gained control of the universe. Devas sought help from Lord Vishnu who advised them to take the path of diplomacy with Asuras and the only way to regain lost glory was to drink Amrutham/nectar. Devas came to an agreement with asuras to jointly churn the ocean for the nectar of immortality and to share it among them. However, Lord Vishu told Devas that he would ensure Amrutha (Nectar) does not get to Asuras.
During the Samudra Manthan (churning) of the Ocean of Milk Mount Mandaranchal was used as the dasher (churning tool), and Vasuki, the king of serpents, became the churning rope. The gods held the tail of the snake, while the demons (Asuras) held its head, and they pulled on it alternately causing the mountain to rotate, which in turn churned the ocean. However, once the mountain was placed on the ocean, it began to sink. With request from both Devas and Asuras Lord Vishnu took the form of a turtle (Kurma avatar), came to their rescue and supported the mountain on his back.
Halahala Poison was the first to come when churning started and this terrified the Devas and Asuras because, the poison was so toxic that it might have destroyed all of creation. On the advice of Vishnu, both Devas and Asuras approached Shiva for help and protection. Out of compassion for living beings, Shiva drank the poison. It was so potent that it changed the color of Shiva’s neck to blue and therefore he is also called Neelakantha (the blue-necked one, Nila = “blue”, kantha = “throat”). Parvati immediately realized the deeds of Shiva and put her hand to stop the poison from entering Lord Shiva’s body.
After the episode, Shiva proceeded to his abode Kailash with Parvati. On the way, he felt exhausted and slightly uncomfortable, when he reached a place in the bounds of Andhra, which came to be called Suruttuppalli. There, he lied down to relax, keeping his head in the lap of Parvati. The gods, who were concerned about Shiva’s well-being assembled there and stood around him, waiting for the Lord to open his eyes. This lying posture of Shiva is rare and unique, is almost similar to Vishnu’s reclining posture.
As soon as the effect of poison diminished and Lord Shiva came back to normalcy all Devas and Asuras wanted to have his Darshan. When they approach Nandi (Sacred Bull) for permission to see Lord Shiva, Nandi refused and asked them to pray and wait since, Lord Shiva and Parvati were together. On waking up, he found that everyone was happy and feeling relieved since a big disaster was averted.
So, happily, he then began his cosmic dance, Anantha Thandavam, on top of the forehead of Rishaba Vahana accompanied by Devendhran reciting flute, Mahalakshmi singing dance, Brahma playing the jalra, Mahavishnu playing the mridangam in the presence of all the Devars and Rishis. This period when Lord Shiva gave them Darshan is known as Pradosha Kalam. Pradhosha, generally, is a significant occasion observed with great piety at all Siva temples. It is believed that Pradosham is originated here.
Valmikeswarar & Ramalingeswarar:
Sage Valmiki prayed to Lord Rama and the Lord gave him darshan. After defeating Ravana, and before reaching Ayodhya, Rama stayed at this place. So, the two together prayed to Lord Siva. The Lingam, which Valmiki prayed to, is called Valmikeswarar and the one Rama prayed to is Ramalingeswarar. At present these two Lingams face each other.
Lava & Kusa visit to this Temple:
Unknowingly twins Lava and Kusa fought with his father Rama over the Ashwamedha Yaga horse. To get salvation from this they visited many Shiva temples along with Sage Valmiki. This is one of the Temples visited by them.
Pancha Brahma Sthalams:
The river Brahma Aranya was believed to have been created by Lord Brahma. Once when he churned the Arani wood (Arani means fire) to create fire to start the Yagna for Sage Romesa, fire came out initially but on churning further, water came out of it and flown as a river. Since this was created by Lord Brahma from the Arani wood, this is called Brahma Aranya river.
The Brahma Aranya river flows from Andhra Pradesh and merges with sea at Pazhaverkadu. Many sages have meditated at the banks of this river and created many temples. Out of these, in five places they have contained all their meditative powers into Shivalingams and built temples. They are called Pancha Brahma Sthalams, representing the five faces of Lord Shiva and they are:
All these temples are many thousand years old and since they have been created by Sages, the base of the lingam (Avudayar) will be in square shape.
The Temple is located at about 2 Kms from Uthukottai, 2 Kms from Uthukottai Bus Stand, 11 Kms from Nagalapuram, 15 Kms from Ramagiri, 26 Kms from Thiruvallur, 29 Kms from Thiruvallur Railway Station, 74 Kms from Tirupati, 60 Kms from Chennai and 72 Kms from Chennai Airport.

The inner temple was constructed around 5th century by the Pallav dynasty. The Chola kings and the Vijayanagara kings constructed the outer temple in the 12th century. The entire temple is carved out of the side of a huge stone hill. The mandapam with 100 pillars and the 120 feet (37 m) high main gopuram were constructed by Krishnadevaraya, the Vijayanagara king in 1516.
The temple complex abounds in lithic records (stone inscriptions) of Chola kings such as Rajaditya (regnal years 947-949 CE), Raja Raja Chola (regnal years 985-1014 CE), his son Rajendra Chola (1012-1044 CE), his son Rajadhiraja (1018-1054 CE), Kulottunga I (1070-1120 CE) and Kulotunga III (1178-1218 CE).

It is located in North Guwahati in Mani Karneswar area on the northern bank of River Brahmaputra. The temple is located at the site where Rudra Singha was cremated as per Hindu last rites. The temple is a fine example of a mixed style of Ahom-Mughal architecture.
In the latter part of his reign, Swargadeo Rudra Singha announced his desire to expand Assam westward as far as the river Karatoya, in present day West Bengal and Bangladesh. It was considered the frontier of the ancient Kamarupa kingdom. Some sources also indicate that his ambition was to include a portion of the sacred Ganga River within his domain. Since Bengal was under the rule of the Mughals, he began to prepare for a massive military expedition against the Mughal Empire. An army of approximately 400,000 soldiers gathered in Guwahati, in which various tribes from the hills and plains came together, including the king of Cachar and the king of Jaintia from present day Meghalaya.
His efforts were in vain. Before his preparations were completed he was seized with a mortal illness and died in August 1714 in his camp at Guwahati. His body was taken to Charaideo, in present day Sivasagar District, for burial as per ancient Tai-Ahom custom. According to some sources, Rudra Singha was cremated according to Hindu customs in North Guwahati, while some denote only one of his small fingers was burnt in this way. His second son, Pramatta Singha, after ascending to the throne, decided to construct in Guwahati a temple to Lord Shiva in memory of his father. The site of his father’s death was selected for the construction of the temple.

https://www.bharattemples.com/tuman-temple-korba/,"At the heart of Korba lies a hidden gem, the Tuman Temple. This ancient temple has a rich history dating back centuries and is steeped in cultural significance. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, one of the most revered Hindu deities. The temple attracts devotees and tourists alike, all drawn to its magnificent architecture and cultural heritage.
Tuman Temple is located in the Korba district of Chhattisgarh state.  Tuman is a small village situated 10 km away from Katghora, which is 30 km away from the district headquarters in the northwest direction. Ancient history states that Tuman was the capital of kings in the Haihaya dynasty. One ancient Shiv Mandir is found here. It is believed that the mandir was built during the reign of Kalchuri (Near 11 A.D) by king Ratnadev First.
Besides this Shiv Mandir, some other remnants are also found there. Tuman Local Language is Chhattisgarhi.
कटघोरा से 10 किमी की दूरी पर स्थित एक छोटे गांव है। जो जिला मुख्यालय से 30 किमी दूर उत्तर-पश्चिम दिशा में है। पृथ्वीदेव जब पेंड्रा जीत कर तुमान की ओर आए तब इन गढ़ों में दामा व दुरहा भाईयों का राज था, जिन्हें हराकर उन्होंने गढ़ पर कब्जा किया, तुमान छत्तीसगढ़ में कलचूरियों की प्रथम राजधानी बनी।
यहां एक प्राचीन शिव मंदिर है। जिसका निर्माण कलचुरि शासक रत्नराज / रत्नदेव प्रथम  (1045 ई.  – 1065 ई. ) के शासनकाल में हुआ था। यहाँ शिव मंदिर के अलावा, अन्य अवशेष भी वहाँ पाए जाते हैं।
Tuman Temple dates back to the 11th century and is believed to have been built by the Chandelas, who were known for their love of art and architecture. The temple was originally built as a shrine to Lord Shiva, one of the three primary Hindu gods, known as the Trimurti. Lord Shiva is regarded as the god of destruction and is also considered to be the god of yogis.
According to legend, the temple is said to be located on the spot where Lord Shiva emerged from the earth in the form of a lingam, a sacred symbol in Hinduism representing the god’s masculine energy. This lingam is worshipped in the temple’s inner sanctum, which is considered to be one of the most sacred spaces in the temple.
The temple has been a pilgrimage site for Hindus for centuries, and many believe that visiting the temple and worshipping Lord Shiva here can bring them good fortune and blessings.
The Tuman Temple is a magnificent example of Nagara-style architecture, which is characterized by its lofty towers and intricate carvings. The temple is made of sandstone and features five beautifully carved towers, each representing one of the five elements – earth, water, fire, air, and space. The temple’s main tower, or shikhara, rises to a height of over 30 meters, making it a truly awe-inspiring sight.
The temple’s walls are adorned with intricate carvings depicting scenes from Hindu mythology, such as the battle between Lord Rama and Ravana, the demon king. The carvings also depict other deities such as Lord Vishnu, the preserver god, and his consort, Goddess Lakshmi.
The inner sanctum of the temple houses the lingam, which is carved from a single piece of stone and is considered to be one of the most beautiful lingams in India. The sanctum is also adorned with beautiful carvings depicting scenes from Lord Shiva’s life.
इस मंदिर के आसपास कई और मंदिर पाये गये थे जिनकी संख्या संख्या लगभग 20 हैं, लेकिन सभी मंदिर ध्वस्त हो चुके है पुरातत्व हैं केवल एक ही मंदिर बचा हुआ हैं, इन सभी मंदिरो का संरक्षण भारतीय पुरातत्व सर्वेक्षण द्वारा किया जाता है, और सभी मंदिरो को संरक्षित स्मारक का दर्जा भी प्राप्त हैं।
प्राचीन इतिहास में कहा जाता है, कि तुमान हैहै वंश के राजाओं की राजधानी हुआ करती थी, जिस समय यहां एक शिव मंदिर मिला जो माना जाता है कि इस प्राचीन शिव मंदिर का निर्माण कल्चुरीयों के राजा रत्नदेव प्रथम द्वारा 11 A.D. आसपास करवाई गयी थी।

https://www.bharattemples.com/bijlipur-templebalrampur/,"The temple built by the erstwhile Maharaja of Balrampur in the 19th century. The location of the temple came to the Maharaja in his dream and is linked to the story that a devotee of Patan Devi used to walk the distance from Bijlipur to Patan Devi every day of his life to pray to the Devi. When he grew old, his physical condition deteriorated untill one day he pleaded to the Devi that he was now unable to come for her darshan due to his old age this was the last visit.
Soon thereafter, the Maharaja of Balrampur was passing by this area which was heavily forested and he took a break for the night in the vicinity. That night there was a storm accompanied by thunder and lightening. The Devi appeared in the Maharaja’s dream and directed him to build a temple at the spot she would indicate. Next morning he received news that a large peepul tree had been struck by lightening and had burnt down. In its place there was a deep hole made in the ground.
The Maharaja then went on to build this temple. It was made of red stone with exquisite carvings for which stone masons were employed from Rajasthan. There is no idol in the main temple. There is a deep hole in the ground which is covered with cloth and prayers to the Devi are performed over it.

Sree Dudhdhari Math was founded by Sree Swami Balabhadradas Ji Maharaj, a monk belonging to 16th Century.

With the passage of time, for the sake of ease of pronunciation, the term evolved as Dudhdhari. The Math thus takes the name Dudhdhari Math.
The Math came under royal patronage of the-then Maratha ruler of Nagpur Maharaja Raghuraoji Bhonsle. The Maharaja brought out a royal charter as per which the head of Sree Dudhdhari Math would be conferred upon the title ‘Rajeshri’ and since then all the Heads/Mahant of the order were given the title of ‘Rajeshri’.

https://www.bharattemples.com/bhoramdeo-temple-kabirdham-chhattisgarh/,"Bhoramdeo Temple, Kabirdham ,Chhattisgarh
Bhoramdeo Temple is a complex of Hindu temples dedicated to the god Shiva in Bhoramdeo, in the Indian state of Chhattisgarh. It comprises a group of four temples of which the earliest is a brick-temple.
The main temple is the Bhoramdeo temple built in stone. The architectural features with erotic sculptures has given a distinct style akin to the Khajuraho temple and the Konarak Sun Temple in Odisha, and hence the Bhoramdeo complex is known by the sobriquet the “Khajuraho of Chhattisgarh”.
Another temple within a distance of about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) from Bhoramdeo, which is mentioned along with the Bhoramdeo complex is the Madwa Mahal, meaning marriage hall in local dialect, also known as Dullhadeo. It was built in 1349 during the reign of Ramchandra Deo of the Nagavanshi dynasty and has a unique Shiva Linga erected over 16 pillars.
The temple complex, rich in history and archeological details, is dated to the Kalachuri period (10th-12th centuries, one ruling over areas in Central India in west Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and were called Chedi or Haihaya (Heyheya) (northern branch)) with close identity with the sculptures found in nearby archeological sites such as Janjgir, Kalachuri, Narayanpur and Ratanpur sites. The brick temples were built during the rule of Pandus and are similar to those built in Kharod, Palari, Rajim and Sirpur in the state.
The temple complex, highlighted as a “scintillating poetry in stone”, is credited to Nagwanshi Kings who practiced tantrism and who ruled in the then Southern Koshal region, which is now the state of Chhattisgarh. Its construction is dated between the 7th and 12th centuries.As the Gond Tribals of the area worshiped Lord Shiva whom they called Bhoramdeo, the temple was also named Bhoramdeo with the Shiva Linga deified in it.
horamdeo temple, built of stone, and dated to the 11th century, which is older than the Khajuraho Group of temples is considered an “outstanding structure”. It has profusion of carved images on its exterior walls. Its architectural style is known as the Gurur type, unlike the north Indian Nagara style of architecture. Its structural uniqueness lies in the receding rows or tiers placed successively upwards in the top part of the temple tower.
The first stage of the temple is a large platform or plinth that is built to height of 5 feet (1.5 m). The platform itself, on its exterior faces, has many sculptures of Hindu deities carved on it.
The temple built over this platform which measures 60 feet (18 m) x 40 feet (12 m) has the conventional Hindu temple composition of a mandapa (hall), followed by an antral or passage leading to the Garbhagriha or sanctum sanctorum, the main enclosure in the temple where the chief deity, Shiva in form of a Shiva Linga, is deified.The mandapa is square on plan and is supported on four main central pillars, apart from the peripheral pillars. The sanctum sanctorum measures 9 feet (2.7 m)x9 feet (2.7 m). All the three enclosures are linked by passageways.
The temple is built facing the eastern direction, where there is an entry door; in addition, there are two more doors which open to the south and north but there is no door in the westerly direction. The three doors have open “half shelters”.
Right at the entrance to the sanctum sanctorum, there are very finely sculpted images of the ten avatars of the god Vishnu, apart from images of Shiva and Ganesha. The towering roof of this garbhagriha is topped by Kalasha, which is circular in shape.The garbhagriha has striking right angled offsets in the north east and southern part which add to the elegance of the temple.There are many small towers which surround the main tower.
The front entrance door of the temple has sculpted images of Ganga and Yamuna on its doorpost.Also sculpted on the exterior and interior walls of the temple are the bass reliefs in the entablature part, of elephants, mythical figures and sensuous sculptures; the sensuous figures on the exterior walls represent the Kama Sutra, the erotic postures which reflects the then prevailing social, cultural, architectural and religious ethos in the region. These sculptures are crafted in three tiers on the exterior face of the temple up to the pinnacle, and are housed in niches. The sculpted images arranged in rows on the outer faces of the main tower vary in size from 1 foot to 1.5 ft to 2 ft in descending order from the top of the tower to its lower end. The main tower expands lower down into four other subsidiary structures to provide stability to the main tower.
The lowest tier of the exterior walls is embellished with sculptures of lions and elephants. The material used for the sculptures are of black and ochre stones (black stone is used to carve pantheon gods while Ochre stone is used for other sculptures). Also sculptured on the exterior face of the temple are divine images of Vishnu and his incarnations.

https://www.bharattemples.com/yogmaya-temple-new-delhi/,"Yogmaya Temple, New Delhi
Yogmaya Temple, also Jogmaya temple, is a Hindu temple shakti peetha dedicated to the sister of Krishna, and situated in Mehrauli, New Delhi, close to the Qutb complex. According to local priests this is one of those 27 temples destroyed by Mahmud Ghazni and later by Mamluks and it is the only surviving temple belonging to pre-sultanate period which is still in use. Hindu king Samrat Vikramaditya Hemu reconstructed the temple and brought back the temple from ruins. During Aurangzeb’s reign a rectangular hall was added to the temple which is a witness of a failed attempt by Mughals to convert this ancient temple into a mosque which was later turned into a store room for Devi’s vastra. Though its original (300-200 BC) architecture could never be restored after its deconstruction by Muslims, but its reconstruction had been carried out repetitively by the locals.
Yogmaya or Jogmaya is considered, an aspect of Maya, the illusionary power of God.The temple is also venue of a large congregation of devotees during the Navratri celebrations.The present temple was built in early 19th century and may be the descendant of a much older Devi shrine. Adjacent to the temple lies, a water body, johad, known as Anangtal Baoli, after King Anangpal Tomar, and covered by trees from all sidesThe temple is also an integral part of an important inter-faith festival of Delhi, the annual Phool Walon Ki Sair.
In 12th-century Jain scriptures, Mehrauli place is also mentioned as Yoginipura, after the temple. The temple is believed to be built by the Pandavas, at the end of Mahabharata war. Mehrauli is one of the seven ancient cities that make up the present state of Delhi. The temple was first renovated during the rule of Mughal Emperor Akbar II (1806–37) by Lala Sethmal.
The temple lies 260 yards from the Iron Pillar in the Qutb complex,and within the Lal Kot walls, the first fortress citadel of Delhi, constructed by the Tomar/Tanwar Rajput King Anangpal I around AD 731 and expanded by King AnangPal II in the 11th century who also constructed Lal Kot
The temple rebuilt in 1827 is a simple but contemporary structure with an entrance hall and a sanctum sanctorum that houses the main Idol of Yogmaya made of black stone placed in a marble well of 2 ft (0.6 m) width and 1 ft (0.3 m) depth. The sanctum is 17 ft (5.2 m) square with a flat roof over which a truncated shikara (tower) is built. Apart from this tower, a dome is the other feature seen in the temple (pictured). The idol is covered in sequins and cloth. Two small pankhas (fans) of the same materials are seen suspended over the Idol from the roof. The walled enclosure around the temple is 400 ft (121.9 m) square, with towers at the four corners. Twenty two towers were built within the precincts of the temple at the orders of the Sood Mal, the builder. The floor of the temple was originally made of red stone but since then has been replaced by marble. The main tower above the sanctum is 42 ft (12.8 m) high and has copper plated shikara or pinnacle.
The flowers and sweet meats offered by the Devotees to the goddess are placed over a marble table of 18 inches square and 9 inches height set in front of the idol in the sanctum floor. Bells, otherwise a part of Hindu temples, are not tolled during the worship of the goddess. Wine and meat are forbidden to be offered at the temple and goddess Yoga Maya is stated to be austere and exacting. An interesting display at the temple premises in the past (but now in an open wall panel) was an iron cage of 8 ft (2.4 m) square and10 ft (3.0 m) in height in which two stone tigers are exhibited. A passage, between the temple and the wall panel has flat roof which is covered with the planks overlaid by bricks and mortar and fixed with bells.[
It is believed that the main idol in the temple was that of Yogamaya, an incarnation of Durga, born as the sister of [Krishna]]. Kansa, cousin of Devaki (mother of Krishna) and uncle of Yogamaya and Kansa attempted to kill Yogamaya on Krishna Janmastami day when Krishna was born. But Yogamaya, who was cleverly substituted for Krishna, vanished after predicting Kansa’s death at the hands of her brother Krishna.
Another folk legend is that of Mughal Emperor Akbar II’s (r. 1806-1837) association with the temple. His wife was distraught at the incarceration and exile of her son Mirza Jehangir who had fired from a Red Fort window at the then British Resident that had resulted in the killing of the bodyguard. Yogamaya had appeared in her dream and the Queen praying for her son’s safe return had vowed to place Punkah made of flowers at the Yogmaya temple and in the nearby Muslim shrine of Qutbuddin Bhaktiar Khaki. This practice set since then is continued to this day in the name of Phool Walon Ki Sair, a festival held for three days during October every year.
Another important fact about this ancient temple is that for more than 5000 years {i.e. the times when the said temple was built}, the people who live around this ancient temple have been taking care of the yogamaya temple. It is said and believed that all these people who are now more than 200 in number had one common ancestor at point in time who, hundreds of years ago started the practice of taking care of the temple by offering prayers to the goddess which includes doing the shringar of the goddess yogamaya twice a day, cleaning the temple, making and distributing prasad to the devotees visiting the temple and other related things. These 200 odd people who now take care of the temple carrying forward the customs and traditions of their forefathers do it voluntarily and amicably.

The temple complex reverentially named as “Malai Mandir” is a harmoniously blended Tamil Word “Malai” {Mountain/Hill) with the Hindi word “Mandir” {Temple}by the people of Delhi, with Sree Swaminatha Swami as the Presiding Deity, and has been attracting an increasing number of people of all classes of people from India and abroad year after year, and has become an important landmark of Delhi. This temple reflects the glory and grandeur of South Indian Temple Architecture at its best. .
The temple complex of the Presiding Deity was consecrated and the Maha Kumbhabhishekam was performed on the 7th of June, 1973. The temple of Sree Karpaga Vinayakar, Sree Sundareswarar and Devi Meenakshi were consecrated and the Maha Kumbhabhishekam performed on the 13th June 1990. The Navagraha Sannidhi along with a Sannidhi of Idumban was consecrated on the 7th of July, 1995. Sree Adi Sankara Hall was inaugurated on the 9th of November, 1997. The third Punarudharana,Ashtabhandhana,Swarna Rajathabhandana Mahakumbhabhishekam of the temple was performed on the 27th of June, 2001.
The year 2007 was unique in the annals of the Temple. An Eka Koti Archana was performed with all solemnity and intense devotion. One crore recitals of the sacred Namavalis of Lord Swaminatha Swami uttered in the sonorous and harmonious unison by twelve learned Sivacharyas continuously for 120 days, for the benefit of not only the participating devotees, but also to the people at large, the country and above all humanity as a whole. It is the earnest belief of the devotees that with the successful completion of the Eka Koti Archanas, the sanctity and dignity of the temple has increased manifold.
With the infinite Grace of Lord Swaminatha Swami, one is inclined to view the future progress of the Samaj in its services to the devotees with great expectations. It has embarked on the comprehensive Building Project trying to improve (a) a wide range of infrastructural facilities in the temple complex for the benefit of the devotees viz. a well equipped modern office, wider auditorium for the assembly of devotees, an additional kitchen and (b) extension of social welfare benefits to the employees, including provision of more number of residences and renovation with increase of living space of their existing residences. Provision has also been made for a library and a Veda Patasala for which attempts are being initiated to secure some additional allotment of land. This composite Building renovation and extension Project is expected to take about three years for its execution.
 
The main temple within the complex, formally called Sree Swaminatha Swami Temple, houses the sanctum sanctorum of Lord Swaminatha. It is situated atop a small hillock in Sector-7 R.K. Puram and overlooking Vasant Vihar in South West Delhi. This is in keeping with the tradition of locating Murugan temples on hills. The sign outside the main temple is written in Tamil, proclaiming Lord Swaminatha’s motto, “Yaamirukka Bayamain” meaning “Why fear when I am there?”. The temple is built entirely of granite, and is reminiscent of the Chola style Tamil Architecture.
Besides the main Swaminatha Swami Temple, the complex contains temples dedicated to Sree Karpaga Vinayagar (elder brother of Lord Swaminatha), Sree Sundareswarar (father of Lord Swaminatha) and Devi Meenakshi (mother of Lord Swaminatha). These subsidiary temples draw inspiration from the Pandya style of Tamil Architecture, as can be seen at the historic Meenakshi Amman Temple in Madurai, Tamil Nadu.
In the Hindu religion, the peacock is considered Lord Swaminatha’s mount or vahana. Accordingly, the temple has adopted a peacock as its pet. This peacock can be seen and heard among the trees and foliage within the temple compound.People from various backgrounds visit the temple .
One can easily reach this temple by metro, nearest metro station is Vasant Vihar which is around 2 km away from there.

Close to the temple, on a hill in the east of Kailash Colony and near the ISKCON temple, lies an edict of Ashoka, dating from the 3rd century BC.
Millions of years ago, the gods who dwelt in the neighbourhood of the present temple were troubled by two giants and were compelled to prefer their complaint to Lord Brahma, ‘the god of all’. But Lord Brahma declined to interfere, and referred them to the Goddess Parvati. Out of the mouth of Maa Parvati sprung Kaushki Devi, who attacked the two giants and slaughtered them, but it so happened, that as their blood fell on the dry earth thousands of giants came into life, and the battle was maintained by Kaushki Devi against great odds. Maa Parvati took compassion on her offspring and out of the eyebrows of Kaushki Devi came maa Kali Devi, ‘whose lower lip rested on the hills below and the upper lip touched the sky above. She drank the blood of the slaughtered giants as it poured out of their wounds; and the goddess obtained a complete victory over their enemies. Maa Kali Devi then fixed her abode here, and she was worshipped as the chief divinity of the place.
It is believed that the Goddess Kalkaji, pleased with the prayers offered and rituals performed by the gods on the advice of Lord Brahma, appeared at the site of temple and blessed them, and settled at the site. During the Mahabharata, Lord Krishna and the Pandavas are said to have worshipped Kali at this temple during the reign of Yudhisthir. The temple itself is believed to have been constructed by Thok Brahmins and Thok Jogians at the request of Kali.
It is also called Jayanti Peetha or Manokamna Siddha Peetha. “Manokamna” literally means desire, “Siddha” means fulfilment, and “peetha” means shrine. So, it is believed to be the holy shrine where one gets the blessings of Maa Kalika Devi

Hanuman Temple in Connaught Place, New Delhi, is an ancient (pracheen in Sanskrit) Hindu temple and is claimed to be one of the five temples of Mahabharata  days in Delhi. The idol in the temple, devotionally worshipped as “Sri Hanuman Ji Maharaj” (Great Lord Hanuman), is that of Bala Hanuman namely, Hanuman as a child. The temple, which has a self manifest idol of Hanuman, has an unusual feature fixed in the spire (Viman) in the form of a crescent moon (an Islamic symbol) instead of the Hindu symbol of Aum or Sun that is commonly seen in most Hindu temples. This became particularly important during the Mughal period corroborating this extraordinary depiction.
Tthe main foyer of the temple through massive silver plated doors, which are engraved with scenes of the epic Ramayana story. The foyer is ventilated with clerestory windows that are adorned with paintings of Hanuman in the cardinal directions depicting his four aspects. Below each Hanuman painting, the full text of Tulsidas’s Sundar Kand is inscribed on the marble tablets affixed on the walls. The Sanctum Sanctorum, which houses the Hanuman idol, is on the north wall on the right side of the entry foyer (pictured), with the idol facing the southern direction in a small bass Relief carving (pictured). Images of Radha and Krishna, a central triumvirate of Rama, Lakshmana and Sita are also installed to the right of the Hanuman idol on the same wall. As the idol of Hanuman faces the southern direction, devotees can discern only one eye of the idol. The idol depicts a Gada (mace or club) in the left hand with the right hand crossed across the chest showing veneration to the adjacent idol of lord Rama, Lakshmana and Sita. A tapering crown adorns the idol, which has a sacred thread on the right shoulder and is clad in a fashioned dhoti.The height of the temple is reported to be 108 ft (32.9 m). The ceiling of the main mandap (hall or pavilion) depicts the epic story of Ramayana artistically painted. The last named deity has created a cult culture among women with Friday worship that was propagated by the religious feature film Jai Santoshi Ma, since 1975. Historically, Delhi located on the banks of the Yamuna River has been stated to be the Indraprastha city built by Pandavas of the Mahabharata epic period. In the Mahabharata days, Pandavas ruled from Indraprastha and Kauravas from Hastinapur (two collateral families) as per a brokered partition of the Kuru empire. But, in a dice game, Pandavas lost their Kingdom and were exiled for a 12 year term and in the 13th year must remain in hiding (with a rider that if they were detected during this period they would undergo the exile denovo). Mythological legend states that during the Pandavas’ exile (imposed by their cousin Duryodhana of the Kaurava dynasty), in order to subdue Bhima’s (second of the five Pandava brothers) arrogance, Hanuman considered to be the brother of Bhima (both Vayu’s children, appeared in the forest disguised as a weak and aged monkey. Bhima, while in search of a fragrant flower sought by Draupadi in the forest, found Hanuman lying with his tail blocking his way and, unaware of Hanuman’s identity, scornfully asked him to remove his tail. But Hanuman told Bhima to lift the tail since being old he was unable to do it on his own. Bhima tried hard several times but failed to lift it, in spite of being a man of great strength. Bhima then realized that the monkey was none other his own brother, apologizes for his arrogant behavior and requests Hanuman to show him his true form. Hanuman was then said to have enlarged himself and showed Bhima the size in which he had crossed the sea to go to Lanka, looking for Sita during the Ramayana epic period. After the Pandavas won the Kurukshetra war against the Kauravas and re–established themselves in Indraprastha, the Pandava clan is stated to have built five temples of Hanuman and other deities.
It is believed that Tulsidas (1532–1623), who wrote Ramacharitamanas (popularly known as Tulsi Ramayan and penned the famous Hanuman Chalisa hymns in praise of Hanuman, visited this temple in Delhi. During his visit to Delhi, Tulsidas was summoned by the Mughal Emperor and asked to perform a miracle, which he did with the blessings of Lord Hanuman. The Emperor was pleased with Tulsidas and presented the Hanuman temple with an Islamic crescent Moon finial which adorns the temple spire. It is also claimed that because of the crescent moon symbol on the spire, the temple was not destroyed by the Muslim rulers who invaded India at various times.
Reportedly, it was built originally by Maharaja Man Singh I of Amber (1540–1614) during Emperor Akbar’s (1542-1605) reign. It was reconstructed by Maharaja Jai Singh (1688-1743) in 1724, around the same time as the Jantar Mantar. After that the temple has undergone many improvements making it a notable religious centre in the heart of Central Delhi.
An important feature of the worship at this temple is the 24–hour chanting of the mantra (hymn) “Sri Ram, Jai Ram, Jai Jai Ram”, since August 1, 1964. It is claimed that this continuous chanting has been recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records.
 
The temple is situated on the Baba Kharak Singh Road (old Irwin Road) about 250 m (820.2 ft) southwest of Connaught place in Central Delhi, which is the commercial hub of Delhi. Tuesday and Saturday are special days of worship when devotees congregate at the temple in large numbers. Hanuman Jayanti (birthday celebrations of lord Hanuman) is held every year with great fanfare on the full moon (Purnima) day in the month of Chaitra (March – April) as per established lunar Hindu Panchangam or Hindu calendar. Colourful processions with festoons and with devotees wearing Hanuman masks and tails and carrying large idols of Hanuman fill the streets.Commercial establishments within the temple complex sell religious offerings and bangles made of lac and plastic.

The site on which the original Temple of Shantadurga stood at Quelossim (Keloshi) is known as “Deoolbhata” and it is in the possession of the Shree Shantadurga Saunsthan Committee,Kavale.
The current temple was constructed during the reign of Maratha ruler Chattrapati Shahu Maharaj of Satara in about 1738 A.D. Naroram Rege Mantri originally from Kochara village in the Vengurla Taluka,(Konkan) was a Mantri (Minister) in Chattrapati Shahu’s Court at Satara (Grandson of Shivaji Maharaj)around 1723. He obtained finances to construct the new temple for the goddess from Chh.Shahu Maharaj of Satara. The temple construction started around 1730 . Due to his efforts, the village of Kavalem was bequeathed to the Temple by Shrimant Bajirao-1 Peshwa in 1738.[
The temple complex is on the slope of the foothills of a mountain chain, surrounded by lush vegetation. There is a main temple and three smaller temples of other deities which have been built on three sides of the temple. The temple consists of a collection of pyramidal roofs with a dome. The pillars and floors are made of Kashmir stone. The temple has a huge tank, a Deepastambha and agrashalas (guest houses).
Many renovations have been completed over the years to the main temple and the temples of the other deities as well as to the agrashala. The temple has recently banned entry of foreigners into the temple citing objectionable dressing and conduct as the reason.

Shamlaji no medo, also spelled Shamalaji, (Gujarati: શામળાજી and Hindi: शामलाजी) is a major Hindu pilgrimage centre in Aravalli district of Gujarat state of India. The Shamlaji temple is dedicated to Vishnu or Krishna. Several other Hindu temples are located nearby.
There is a small shrine on the way from the Shamlaji Temple to the Meshwo river, where an image of a standing Ganesha idol from the late-Gupta period is still worshiped.
The temple at Harishchandra ni chori probably dates to the 10th century A.D. It has a rectangular sanctum with a large pavilion in front. The whole structure is enclosed within the courtyard. The walls of this courtyard have fallen down but the ornamental gateway (torana) still stands.
Numerous temples in ruins, ancient brick-work and scattered idols found at Shamlaji show that since ancient times it has been a popular and important center of pilgrimage on the highway between Gujarat and Rajasthan. Devni Mori, a place about two kms from Shamlaji, is having remains of a Buddhist monastery from around 3rd-4th century AD. The stupa which is considered as a sharir stupa, has proved the presence of Buddhists in Vadnagar. Excavating of the stupa brought to light an inscribed casket which contained relics of Buddha. It is quite clear that the bodily relics of Buddha in the casket.Being a place of pilgrimage established at a picturesque spot, there are several other ancient shrines scattered all over this place. Amongst them is the small temple of Trilokeshwer just opposite Shamlaji has a beautiful and unusual idol of Shiva with the trident. The Kashi-Vishwanath Mahadev is a simple but ancient temple, which is about seven feet below the ground level. The temple of Ranchhodji, is on the opposite bank. There is also the tomb of Navgaja Pir, a maulvi (muslim cleric) close by visited by many Adivasis.
Shamlaji temple is located on the banks of the Meshvo river in the valley surrounded by well wooded hills.It is also referred to as Dholi Dhajawala due to white silk flag fluttering on top of the temple.
Built of white sandstone and brick it is surrounded by a wall with a gateway. It is of two stories, supported on pillars, and a canopy with arches on each side. The lower courses of richly carved stone are of great age. Above them runs a frieze with an unintelligible pattern, and, above this, running right round the building, a fringe of elephants’ heads and forequarters carved in stone. Above this is a very ranch worn frieze full of figures in bass-relief, men on horseback with bows, and animals. The elephant is a very frequent emblem. Besides the fringe frieze above mentioned, there are, on the outer wall, between every two angles, larger figures of semi-rampant elephants standing out in relief, and, in front of the entrance, stands on either side of the doorway a gigantic cement elephant. Above the shrine, a pyramid-based tower rises into a spire like a high-shouldered cone with flattened sides. The forepart of the roof consists of a number of small domes springing from a flat roof, or rather of a flat trabeate roof, with domes here and there, the largest being in the centre. Outside at all the angles of the roof are figures of animals and the gargoyles.On walls, there are some scenes from the epics Mahabharata and Ramayana.
Of the two inscriptions, one is to the left in the upper story and bears date 94 AD and 102 AD. This writing, cut in stone, is not very archaic and could not be of the date it professes to record. It may be a transcript of an older inscription or the record of an old tradition. The other, on copper at the entrance of the temple, records repairs executed in 1762 AD by the then Thakor of Tintoi. From these two inscriptions, name of the deity seems to be Gadadharji, the holder of the club, a well known title of Vishnu, Krishna, or Shamlaji.The cow idols are also worshiped depictiong childhood of Krishna as cowherd. It is one of the 154 important pilgrimage sites of Vaishnavism.
A microlith site known as Dhek-Vadlo locally was found near Shamlaji. A Buddhist stupa known as Devni Mori is located near it which dates to Mauryan period.
Several ruins of temples, scattered idols and old brick-works surrounding the place establishes antiquity of the place.
The present temple dedicated to Shamlaji, a form of Vishnu or a name of Krishna, is built probably in 11th century in Chaulukya style and renovated at least 500 years ago. The temple was claimed by Jains in the past.Years ago the Idar State rulers gave the fiefdom of Shamlaji temple to the Modhari Rao Saheb with other villages like Revdar, Devdar, Napada, Khalsa, Sunsar, Modhari, etc. The Rao of Modhari still holds trusteeship of Shamlaji Temple

At one time Lord Krishna wished to invite the sage Durvasa for dinner and accordingly he set out with Rukmini to the ashram of Durvasa who agreed on the condition that they pull the chariot in which he would travel. They agreed but, on the way, Rukmini became thirsty and asked Lord Krishna for water. He struck the earth with his foot and Ganga gushed forth. Rukmini quenched her thirst. Durvasa was watching and flew into a rage because he was not offered water first. Durvasa, it must be.
known as a sage who easily lost his temper and cursed anyone and everyone left and right without much thought. In his rage, he cursed Rukmini that the couple would always live apart. No one knows why he did not curse Lord Krishna but as a result of the curse, they had to live apart. Was the curse revoked? No one knows. Some say that it was actually Lord Krishna who indirectly incited Durvasa to curse her unwittingly because Krishna did not like her arrogance. Anyway, this is the reason why the Rukmini Devi temple is not adjacent to Dwarkadheesh temple but it is at a distance. It is also noteworthy that the temple stands on barren land amid rocks bereft of water.
Rukmini had fallen in love with Lord Krishna and he too was smitten with her and decided to abduct her. She would always go to Avantika temple and pray to Amba Mata to grant her wish that she become the wife of Lord Krishna.  She was the daughter of Bhishmaka, King of Vidarbha and her brother was against the match and did not approve but wanted to marry her off to the evil Shishupal. She sent a message to Lord Krishna to save her and therefore, both decided to elope. One day she went to worship at the temple (which is currently in Bulandshahr, UP) and that day, Lord Krishna carried her away and married her in Madhavpur Ghed in Gujarat and both lived in bliss until the Durvasa incident. Madhavpur too has a temple of Rukmini and Krishna to commemorate this event. It is believed Amba Mata grants the wishes of maidens who pray to her at this temple.
Some believe that Radha and Rukmini are one and the same, the incarnations of Goddess Lakshmi because there are similarities in age and the devotion they have towards the Lord. When Krishna is with Rukmini, Radha does not appear and when he is with Radha, Rukmini is absent.
Rukmini is Lakshmi incarnate, a symbol of love and devotion to Krishna, a symbol of purity and humility as well.
The temple is about 2 km from the historic temple of Dwarka on the coast of Saurashtra in Gujarat, Western India. It can be reached by hiring a rickshaw or just taking a walk from the main temple. In order to reach Dwarka, you can take a train from Ahmedabad to Jamnagar and travel by road. You can just as well fly into Jamnagar airport.

The Somnath temple located in Prabhas Patan near Veraval in Saurashtra on the western coast of Gujarat, is believed to be the first among the twelve jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva. It is an important pilgrimage and tourist spot of Gujarat. Reconstructed several times in the past after repeated destruction by several Muslim invaders and Portuguese, the present temple was reconstructed in Chaulukya style of Hindu temple architecture and completed in May 1951. The reconstruction was completed by Vallabhbhai Patel. The site of Somnath has been a pilgrimage site from ancient times on account of being a Triveni sangam (the confluence of three rivers: Kapila, Hiran and Sarasvati). Soma, the Moon god, is believed to have lost his lustre due to a curse, and he bathed in the Sarasvati River at this site to regain it. The result is the waxing and waning of the moon, no doubt an allusion to the waxing and waning of the tides at this sea shore location. The name of the town Prabhas, meaning lustre, as well as the alternative names Someshvar and Somnath
According to popular tradition documented by J. Gordon Melton, the first Shiva temple at Somnath is believed to have been built at some unknown time in the past. The second temple is said to have been built at the same site by the “Yadava kings” of Vallabhi around 649 CE. In 725 CE, Al-Junayd, the Arab governor of Sindh is said to have destroyed the second temple as part of his invasions of Gujarat and Rajasthan. The Gurjara-Pratihara king Nagabhata II is said to have constructed the third temple in 815 CE, a large structure of red sandstone.
However, there is no historical record of an attack on Somnath by Al-Junayd. Nagabhata II is known to have visited tirthas in Saurashtra, including Someshvara (the Lord of the Moon), which may or may not be a reference to a Siva temple because the town itself was known by that name.The Chaulukya (Solanki) king Mularaja possibly built the first temple at the site sometime before 997 CE, even though some historians believe that he may have renovated a smaller earlier temple.
Ruined Somnath temple, 1869
In 1024, during the reign of Bhima I, the prominent Turkic ruler Mahmud of Ghazni raided Gujarat, plundering the Somnath temple and breaking its jyotirlinga despite pleas by Brahmins not to break it. He took away a booty of 20 million dinars. Historians expect the damage to the temple by Mahmud to have been minimal because there are records of pilgrimages to the temple in 1038, which make no mention of any damage to the temple. However, powerful legends with intricate detail developed in the Turko-Persian literature regarding Mahmud’s raid,which “electrified” the Muslim world according to scholar Meenakshi Jain.They later boasted that Mahmud had killed 50,000 devotees. The devotees had tried to defend the temple from being vandalised and looted.
The temple at the time of Mahmud’s attack appears to have been a wooden structure, which is said to have decayed in time (kalajirnam). Kumarapala (r. 1143–72) rebuilt it in “excellent stone and studded it with jewels,” according to an inscription in 1169.During its 1299 invasion of Gujarat, Alauddin Khalji’s army, led by Ulugh Khan, defeated the Vaghela king Karna, and sacked the Somnath temple.Legends in the later texts Kanhadade Prabandha (15th century) and Khyat (17th century) state that the Jalore ruler Kanhadadeva later recovered the Somnath idol and freed the Hindu prisoners, after an attack on the Delhi army near Jalore.However, other sources state that the idol was taken to Delhi, where it was thrown to be trampled under the feet of Muslims.These sources include the contemporary and near-contemporary texts including Amir Khusrau’s Khazainul-Futuh, Ziauddin Barani’s Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi and Jinaprabha Suri’s Vividha-tirtha-kalpa. It is possible that the story of Kanhadadeva’s rescue of the Somnath idol is a fabrication by the later writers. Alternatively, it is possible that the Khalji army was taking multiple idols to Delhi, and Kanhadadeva’s army retrieved one of them.
The temple was rebuilt by Mahipala I, the Chudasama king of Saurashtra in 1308 and the lingam was installed by his son Khengara sometime between 1331 and 1351. As late as the 14th century, Gujarati Muslim pilgrims were noted by Amir Khusrow to stop at that temple to pay their respects before departing for the Hajj pilgrimage.
In 1395, the temple was destroyed for the third time by Zafar Khan, the last governor of Gujarat under the Delhi Sultanate and later founder of Gujarat Sultanate. In 1451, it was desecrated by Mahmud Begada, the Sultan of Gujarat.
In 1546, the Portuguese, based in Goa, attacked ports and towns in Gujarat including Somnath and destroyed several temples and mosques.
By 1665, the temple, one of many, was ordered to be destroyed by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. In 1702, he ordered that if Hindus revived worship there, it should be demolished completely.[38]
In 1782-83, Maratha king Mahadaji Shinde, victoriously brought back three silver gates from Lahore after defeating Mahmud Shah Abdati, to Somnath. After refusal from priests of Gujarat and the then ruler Gaekwad to put them back on Somnath temple, these silver gates were placed in the temples of Ujjain. Today they can be seen in two temples of India, Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga and Gopal Mandir of Ujjain.
In 1842, Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough issued his Proclamation of the Gates, in which he ordered the British army in Afghanistan to return via Ghazni and bring back to India the sandalwood gates from the tomb of Mahmud of Ghazni in Ghazni, Afghanistan. These were believed to have been taken by Mahmud from Somnath. Under Ellenborough’s instruction, General William Nott looted the gates in September 1842. A whole sepoy regiment, the 6th Jat Light Infantry, was detailed to carry the gates back to India in triumph. However, on arrival, they were found not to be of Gujarati or Indian design, and not of Sandalwood, but of Deodar wood (native to Ghazni) and therefore not authentic to Somnath.They were placed in the arsenal store-room of the Agra Fort where they still lie to the present day.oused in Britain by the gates

https://www.bharattemples.com/sun-temple-modhera-mehsana-gujarat/,"Surya Mandir is one of the ancient places to see in Modhera. The temple is over 5000 years old and is located in the northern part of Triveni Ghat. Sun God is the main deity at the temple and just above the entrance doorway lies the image of Surya with his two wives riding on 7 horses.
The Sun Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the solar deity Surya located at Modhera village of Mehsana district, Gujarat, India. It is situated on the bank of the river Pushpavati. It was built after 1026-27 CE during the reign of Bhima I of the Chaulukya dynasty. No worship is offered now and is protected monument maintained by Archaeological Survey of India. The temple complex has three components: Gudhamandapa, the shrine hall; Sabhamandapa, the assembly hall and Kunda, the reservoir. The halls have intricately carved exterior and pillars. The reservoir has steps to reach bottom and numerous small shrines.
The temple complex is built in Maru-Gurjara style (Chaulukya style). The temple complex has three axially aligned components; the shrine proper (garbhagriha) in a hall (gudhamandapa), the outer or assembly hall (sabhamandapa or rangamandapa) and a sacred reservoir (kunda).
The sabhamandapa is not in continuation with gudhamandapa but is placed little away as a separate structure. Both are built on paved platform.Their roofs have collapsed long ago leaving behind few lower-most courses. Both roofs are 15′ 9″ in diameter but are constructed differently.The platform or plinth is inverted lotus shaped.
The Gudhamandapa measures 51 feet 9 inches by 25 feet 8 inches. It is almost equally divided into Gudhamandapa, the hall and garbhgriha, the shrine proper. Both are rectangular in plan with one projection on each of the smaller sides and two projections on each of the longer sides. This projections on the smaller sides form the entrance and the back of shrine. The three projections of outer wall of Gudhamandapa had windows on each side and the east projection had the doorway. These windows had perforated stone screens; the northern is in ruins and the southern is missing. Pradakshinamarga is formed by the passage between the walls of garbhgriha and the outer walls of gudhamandapa. The roof of passage has stones slabs carved with rosettes. The Shikhara of the it no longer exists.
The Garbhagriha, the shrine proper or sanctum sanctorum is square measuring 11 feet from inside.The shrine had two cells; a cell below the level of upper cell. The floor of upper cell is now fallen which once housed the image of deity. The seat of image is now in pit. The lower cell was probably used for storage.The walls inside shrine is plain and outer wall is decorated. The doorway has carved figures of seated Surya in panels surrounded by dancers and amorous couples. All figures are mutilated and the images on the door-lintel is completely destroyed.The sanctum sanctorum is designed in a way that the first rays of rising sun lit up the image of Surya during solar equinox daysand on summer solstice day, the sun shines directly above the temple at noon casting no shadow.
Gudhamandapa with annotation of exterior mouldings (click to enlarge) Base mouldings
The outer walls of shrine is highly decorated. The base and walls of the shrine and hall are divided into several stretches with unique carvings. the pitha or adhisthana, base has the two square members called bhat followed by a cymarecta carving (lower part convex and upper part concave). It is followed by padma or padmaka, the moulding in form of inverted lotus. The next is antarita, a fillet or an astragal with a sharp edge between two recesses. Above this is patta having thin moulding called chhaja at its lower edge. The next is another chhaja separated by neck, alinga. The next broad band, patti, is gajathara carved with elephants. The following band narathara has figures of men in different attitudes.Mandovara or wall mouldings
Mandovara, the wall mouldings starts with kumbha, a pitcher. It has a broad undecorated band at lower part while middle part is decorated with oval discs. It is followed by kalasha, a pitcher. The next is broad band with chaitya-windows called kevala followed by similar called manchi. These two bands are separated by a deep band. There is a thin fillet above which the major paneled face of wall called janghaexist. This panels are decorated with figures of gods but the figures of Surya are placed prominently than others as the temple is dedicated to him. Other panels are decorated with dancers and other figures.
The figures of Surya are prominently carved on three niches of shrine proper as well as on the each side of three windows in the outer wall of Gudhamandapa. The figures of Surya is in standing position with two arms holding lotuses and driven by seven horses.It has some Persian influences. The walls have 12 niches showing the different aspects of Surya in each month. Other figures include eight Dikpals, Vishwakarma, Varuna, Agni, Ganesha, Saraswati.[citation needed]
Every figure in panel has a small cornice over it surmounted with triangular pediment consisting of chaitya-window which is called udgam. The next projecting band with chaitya-window and kirtimukha is called malakval. The top most is the major cornice called chhajli.
This is followed by shikhara which no longer exist. The Vimana had horizontal geometrical and figurative bands which rising to create the Mount Meru-like shikhara. The central spire had Urushringa, the miniature shrines. It is judged by the shrines on the steps of Kunda.Mandapa
The Mandapa, a hall was roofed by a dome which probably rose in concentric manner. It is supported by eight principal pillars below arranged in an octagon, four pillars in front of shrine proper and two each in the recesses of windows and door.[1]
Sabhamandapa or Rangamandapa, the assembly hall or dancing hall is parallelogram in plan with rows of pillars opening entrance on each side diagonally. The extensively carved exterior has series of recessed corners giving impression of the star like plan of it. There are 52 intricately carved pillars. Madhusudan Dhaky has suggested that the sabhamandapa may has been later addition based on style and construction.
The pitha is almost similar to the Gudhamandapa but smaller as two courses of fillets are omitted. The padma is carved richly here with floral ornamentation.
Above the Narathara, there is a band with figures of dancers and gods known as rajasena. The next is vedi which correspond to jangha of mandovara decorated with large panels of gods, goddesses and floral designs. The next is cornice called asinot. It followed by kakshasana which slopes outwards and forms the back-rests of the bench, asana which runs round the hall. There are erotic figures on it interrupted by rail-patterns. Ceiling and torana
The roof was in shape of stepped pyramid but it no longer exists. Inside, the walnut-shaped ceiling rises in tiers which has numerous floral girdles. It is 23 feet high.[3] It is supported by pillars arranged in an octagon. These pillars have stilts which supports the lintels. Torana or the decorated cusped arches arise from the lower brackets of the pillars and touch the lintels in middle. There are two types; semicircular and triangular. The semicircular arches has cusped arches with tips while triangular arches has round apex and wavy sides. Both types has broad band decorated with figures and tips which are now defaced and damaged. The lower brackets has makara which gives the name of makara-torana while decoration gives name of chitra-torana.
Long and short pillars, semicircular and triangular archesPillars of Kirti-torana and steps leading to kundaThe pillars of Sabhamandapa and Gudhamandapa are of two types; short and tall. The short pillars rests on walls and supports the roof. The tall pillars rise from the floor.
The shaft is square in shape till half of its height followed by vase and then followed by octagonal shaft. It is surmounted by a capital and a bracket. The square part has floral design in circle on each side of faces. The vase is decorated similarly on its corners. The octagonal part have four bands; the top most has kirtimukha. The capital has three annulets. Tall pillars
They arise from square or octagonal base, kumbhi, with triangular ornamentation on each face. Above it is kalasha. It is followed by a deep band and the next is kevala decorated with chaitya-windows. the next is kirtimukha. The next is triangular pediment with chaitya-windows.
The next is beginning of shaft. It is first decorated with standing figures, mostly dancers, on all eight faces enclosed in ringed pilasters. The next band with scenes of men and beasts is separated from it by round pillow-like band. It is followed by still smaller band with sixteen standing human figures separated by small annultet below. The next is band of leaves. Then the shaft becomes circular and had three or four bands having row of male warriors, lozenges, circles and kirtimukha at last. The kirtimukhas are separated by chain and bell ornamentation.
It follows capital similar to small pillars crowned with makara brackets if eight stilted pillar and dwarfs in the rests. the eight stilted pillars have one more shaft and similar type of capital which is crowned with brackets of volutes and pendant leaves.[1]
The panels on the Gudhamandapa is decorated with Surya centrally which indicates that the temple is dedicated to Surya. These images wears peculiar West Asian (Persian) boots and belt.[10][3] The other corners and niches are decorated with figures of Shiva and Vishnu in various forms, Brahma, Nāga and goddesses. The depicted scenes on small flat ceilings and lintels of sabhamandapa are from epics like Ramayana.
There was a kirti-torana, the triumphant arch, in front of sabhamandapa. The pediment and torana no longer exists but two pillars remains. The moulding and decoration is similar to that of walls of sabhamandapa and pillars.There were two more kirti-torana on each side of the kunda of which only one exists without upper part.
Kunda, a tank or reservoir is known as Ramakunda or Suryakunda. The flight of steps through kirti-torana leads to the reservoir. It is rectangular. It measures 176 feet from north to south and 120 feet from east to west. It is paved with stones all around. There are four terraces and recessed steps to descend to reach the bottom of the tank. The main entrance lies on west. There are steps to reach from one terrace to another on right angle to terrace. These steps are rectangular or square except the first step of each flight of steps which is semicircular. 
The stepwell on the west of Kunda has one entrance and two pavilion-towers. It is moderately ornamented. The door-frame has lotus and leaves and the ruchaka type pilasters indicate it belongs to 11th century. The small mandapa above the ground level and located on the second kuta of stepwell may belong to 10th century.
The shrine proper of the Sun Temple was built during the reign of Bhima I of Chaulukya dynasty.[A][1][2][3][4] Earlier, during 1024-25, Mahmud of Ghazni had invaded Bhima’s kingdom, and a force of around 20,000 soldiers had unsuccessfully tried to check his advance at Modhera. Historian A. K. Majumdar theorizes that the Sun Temple might have been built to commemorate this defence.[5]On a block in western wall of cella, there is an inscription “Vikram Samvat 1083” upside down carelessly incised in Devnagari scriptwhich correspond to 1026-1027 CE. No other date is found. As the inscription is upside down, it evidences the destruction and reconstruction of the cella. Due to position of the inscription, it is not firmly considered as the date of construction. On the stylistic ground, it is known that the kunda with its corner shrines was built earlier in the beginning of the 11th century. The inscription is rather considered as the date of destruction by Ghazni instead of the construction. Soon after Bhima had returned to the power. So the temple proper, the miniature and the niche shrines in the tank was built shortly after 1026 CE. The dancing hall was added much later in the third quarter of the 12th century along with the gateways, the porch of the temple proper and the doorframes of the temple and the cella during the reign of the Karna.
The temple is built on 23.6° latitude (approximately near Tropic of Cancer). The place was later known as Sita ni Chauriand Ramkund locally.[C][12] No worship is offered here now.[3] The temple is Monument of National Importance and is maintained by Archeological Survey of India.
It is located in Modhera village which is 25 km from Mehsana and 106 km from Ahmedabad in Gujarat India.

The original temple, completed in 1140 to lavish proportions with extensive ornamentation, consisted of a roof measuring 32 feet (9.8 m), much larger than the Abu temple. Its overall dimensions were 300 by 230 feet (91 m × 70 m) with the central building 150 feet (46 m) in length.It was a triple storied temple with 1,600 pillars, 12 entrance doors, and 11 shrines of Rudra positioned around it. The sanctum was located on the west and there was also a mandapa or hall which had porches on the eastern, northern, and southern wings. Today only a few remnants of this complex are seen, such as two “toranas” (porches) and four pillars. One “torana” is elaborately ornamented; the eastern gate which leads to the Saraswati river still stands; the remaining pillars have highly ornamented carvings. Kirti Torana of North has survived. The western part of complex converted into the congregation mosque is also there
Siddhpur, historically known as Sristhal. Sidhpur, under the rulers of Chaulukya dynasty, was a prominent town in the 10th century. In the tenth century (943 AD) Mularaja, the founder of the Chaulukya dynasty of Gujarat, started the erection of the Rudra Mahalay temple. In his youth, Muladev had slain his maternal uncle, usurped his throne, and murdered the whole of his mother’s kindred; and in old age his crimes hung heavily on his mind. He made pilgrimages and courted the favour of Brahmins from far and near. To a band of them he gave Sristhal, and committing the kingdom to his son Chamundaraja, he retired there to end his days in their company (996 AD). But the Rudra Mahalay was still incomplete, nor was it finished till 1140 AD.An inscription and ballad regarding its construction says,
It was during the 12th century, in 1140 AD, that Jayasimha Siddharaja (1094–1144) consecrated the temple complex and it became the principal temple complex of Siddhpur.[1]
According to another legend, two Parmars from Malwa, named Govinddas and Madhavdas, took up their haunt among the rush grass that covered the neighbourhood of the Rudra Mahalaya, and lived by plunder. There they found the foundations of a temple and Shiva linga, and said that in the night they had seen heavenly beings. This was told to Siddharaj and led to the erection or completion of the temple.[1]
In Mirat-i-Ahmadi, Ali Muhammad Khan writes, “The king on signifying his intention of building the temple, requested the astrologers, it is said, to appoint a fortunate hour; and they at this time predicted the destruction of the building.” Then Siddha Raja caused images of “horse lords” and other great kings to be placed in the temple, and “near them a representation of himself in the attitude of supplication, with an inscription praying that, even if the land was laid waste, this temple might not be destroyed.”
Alauddin Khalji sent an army under Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan, who dismantled the temple complex in 1296 AD (Samvat 1353).The temple was further destroyed and the western part of it was converted into congregational mosque (Jami Mosque) by Muslim ruler Ahmed Shah I (1410–44) of Muzaffarid dynasty in 1414 or 1415.

The temple has not been renovated for at least 100 years, and therefore portrays an antique look. The surrounding landscape is filled with Pimpal trees, Bili Trees and Vakhada trees. Pimpleshwar Mahadev in Saldi does not have the usual Shiv linga. Instead it has a Jaladhari – a continuous flow of water from an aquifer below the ground. The  temple has images of Ganesha, Parvati and Hanuman carved in stone and has smaller shrines of Amba,Laks
Salvabhai Patel, son of Teja Patel, migrated from Champaner, Gujarat and raised his family in the area which ultimately came to be known as Saldi. Approximately 200 years or seven generations following the founding of Saldi village, one of the cows of a herder named Petha Patel was found to be regularly releasing her milk over one location under a Pimpal tree, where the Jaladhari water source was ultimately found. In the Hindu tradition, worshipers of Shiva pay homage to the Shiv linga by pouring milk over it. Thus, the cow’s offering of her milk at this site without any assistance, led to the people of Saldi to attribute this phenomenon to the presence of Lord Shiva. Since then, the current site of Pimpleshwar Mahadev is considered to be very sacred by the pilgrims and villagers alike, and it has become famous throughout the state of Gujarat over the years.
The first temple or shrine was put in place by Petha Patel of Saldi at this site, dating back to the Hindu year Vikram Samvat 1143 (1086 AD). The current building was constructed and renovated by Sayajirao Gaekwad, the ruler of the state Baroda in 1895 during the British colonial era in India.
Saldi is located about 60 km northwest of Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.
By rail – Saldi and Mehsana are the nearest railway stations. Ahmedabad, a major rail head, well connected to other parts of the country is located at a distance of 50kms from the shrine.

The Shiva Purana says Nageshvara Jyotirlinga is in ‘the Darukavana’, which is an ancient name of a forest in India. ‘Darukavana’ finds mention in Indian epics, such as Kamyakavana, Dvaitavana, Dandakavana.
A narrative in the Shiva Purana about the Nageshvara Jyotirlinga tells of a demon named Daaruka, who attacked a Shiva devotee named Supriya and imprisoned him along with many others in his city of Darukavana, a city under the sea inhabited by seasnakes and demons. At the urgent exhortations of Supriya, the prisoners started to chant the holy mantra of Shiva and immediately thereafter the Lord Shiva appeared and the demon was vanquished, later residing there in the form of a Jyotirlinga. The demon had a wife, a demoness named Daaruki who worshipped Mata Parvati. As a result of her penance and devotion, Mata Parvati enabled her to master the forest where she performed her devotions, and renamed the forest ‘Darukavana’ in her honour. Wherever Daaruki went the forest followed her. In order to save the demons of Darukavana from the punishment of the gods, Daaruka summoned up the power Parvati had given her. She then moved the entire forest into the sea where they continued their campaign against the hermits, kidnapping people and keeping them confined in their new lair under the sea, which was how that great Shiva devotee, Supriya, had wound up there.
The arrival of Supriya caused a revolution. He set up a lingam and made the prisoners recite the mantra Om Namaha Shivay in honour of Shiva while he prayed to the lingam. The demons’ response to the chanting was to attempt to kill Supriya, though they were thwarted when Shiva appeared and handed him a divine weapon that saved his life. Daaruki and the demons were defeated and Parvati saved the remaining demons. The lingam that Supriya had set up was called Nagesha; it is the tenth lingam.[9] Shiva once again assumed the form of a Jyotirlinga with the name Nageshwar, while the Goddess Parvati was known as Nageshwari. The Lord Shiva then announced that he would show the correct path to those who would worship him.

It is located in Kalupur area of Ahmedabad, the largest city in Gujarat, India. It was built on the instructions of Swaminarayan Bhagwan, the founder of the sect.
As per the will of Swaminarayan, the administration of the Swaminarayan Sampraday is divided into two Gadis (seats) – NarNarayan Dev Gadi and LaxmiNarayan Dev Gadi. This temple is the headquarters of the NarNarayan Dev Gadi. Green and yellow sculptures of Hindu gods and goddesses, their bodies fitted in opulent dress, cover the structure of this nineteenth-century temple.
With its architecture based on Burma teak wood, every coloured arch and bracket is a bright different shade, something that stands out in most Swaminarayan temples. According to Anjali Desai, author of India Guide Gujarat, the temple resembles a fairytale with all its colours and opulent carvings that profusely embellish every wooden bracket, column and arch. The temple attracts a million people on the day after Diwali. The temple has a multi-story guesthouse that is air conditioned and has a fully equipped medical clinic within its compound.
 
The central gateway of the temple is artistic. It blends local, regional and British styles of architecture and sculpture. Marathi and Rajasthani folk cultures and costumes are evident on the gateway sculptors. The columns are engraved with vertical lining in Corinthian order. The top of the projected pavilions are ruminants of Mughal architecture. Statues of the women wearing frilled blouses and petticoats, carrying their kids on their waist depict the Gujarati women.This central gate is made without taking any kind of measurements.
This is the heart of the temple complex. The temple was constructed as per scriptural norms with intricate carving in pure Burma-teak and constructed with sculptural art by depicting deities’ episodes, auspicious symbols and religious icons representing axiomatic religion and Indian culture. The temple is believed to be a valuable cultural heritage in the socio-religious history of Gujarat and India. The images in this temple are of Narnarayan Dev in the centre, Radhakrishna Dev on the right, Dharmadev, BhaktiMata and Harikrishna on the left of the central hall. The images were made in Dungarpur and stone came from quarries in Himmatnagar and Dhrangadhra. The temple is also known for the attractive dresses that drape the deities. Dresses for the central Narnarayan as well as RadhaKrishna images are changed seven times a day and are never repeated.
Inside the temple
Besides the gods in the main temple, an idol in the form of a child, Ghanshyam Maharaj in white marble has been installed on the ground floor. Personal items of Swaminarayan have been displayed for viewing by the visitors on the ground as well as first floor. The southern side of this building is known as Shree Tejendra Bhuvan and houses visiting pilgrims.
An idol of Ghanshyam Maharaj has been installed in a place called the Rang Mahol in the temple where Swaminarayan stayed during his visits to Ahmedabad. A wood carved life-size idol of Swaminarayan in standing sambhang position, was installed here fifty years after the construction of the temple. It is one of the finest specimens of wooden art sculpting in Gujarat.
The Haveli (Mansion) to the west of the temple used to be the official residence of Acharya of the Narnarayan Dev Gadi. Now, the ground floor of the front side, houses the offices and the inner portion accommodates the residency of the Samkhya Yogi women (ladies who have taken celibacy vows and devoted their life to the temple). In the inner temple, the Gadiwalla (the Acharya Maharajshri’s wife & spiritual leader of the women in the Swaminarayan Sampraday) holds religious assemblies solely for the benefit of the women. An idol of Ghanshyam Maharaj has been installed in this temple and is served by the Sankhya Yogi women devotees.
This mansion is decorated with chandeliers, suspended lamps and large mirrors as it was supposed to be the residence of the Acharya. The brackets of the pillars in the portico as well as arches have been adorned with carvings in geometrical designs and a variety of flower and creeper motifs.
The wood sculptured haveli
This three-storey mansion was constructed by Acharya Maharjshree Keshavprasadji Maharaj in 1871.
The mansion itself rests on octagonal and square wooden pillars on which Ardh-murt relief sculpture of flowers and creepers is engraved. Angles of wooden pillars, carved in free hand design and the shapely Bharnai, which balconies rest on. The Sabha mandap, an extensive Central Hall, has been constructed on sixty pillars. There are giant size madal-shilp sculptures on twelve high pillars in the front row on which rest the portico of the first floor, capture our attention with its great artistic appeal. These sculptors include a flying Hanuman lifting the Devgiri mountain in his palm; a pot bellied Ghanesha wearing a scarlet turban in the South Indian style, miniature sculptures of several soldiers armed and dressed in Marathi turbans and costumes and herds of monkeys have been created on the religious tradition in the wooden sculptors. Some sculptors depict the 1857 uprising, with the Rani of Jhansi and other heroes narrated in carvings of these pillars. There are a total of 12 such pillars, which depict scenes such as a Maratha warrior fighting under the Rani of Jhansi in guise of Durga the Hindu goddess, Indian leader Tatya Tope in the guise of Narsimha, the lion headed form of Vishnu and that of parrots which tell the mood of the times.
Sculptures of lions and elephants, birds like peacocks and parrots and perfectly engraved leaves and flowers decorate the panels. The beams, ceilings, and lower sections are adorned with engravings, artistic sculptures and free-hand designs. In this mansion, Acharya sits on the wooden seat once used by Swaminarayan in the Congregation Hall. A new residence of the saints, Vrajendraprasad Mahal and a dining hall for the devotees are also situated in this mansion.
This mansion is two storeyed. Sculptures of animal heads, flowers and creepers are carved on the wooden pillars of the portico on the ground floor. Items relating to NarNarayan Dev on the ground floor. The first and second floors house a Sanskrit and music school as well as residence for saints. The backyard hosts the residence for brahmchari(celibate) students. A well where Swaminarayan used to bathe under a dome is also part of the backyard.
The land for construction of this first shrine of Swaminarayan Sampraday, was given by the British Imperial Government in India to Swaminarayan. The task of constructing this temple was entrusted personally by Swaminarayan to Ananandanand Swami (a paramhansa of the sect).The installation ceremony of the murti(images) in the temple was celebrated in the presence about 50,000 of pilgrims representing many parts of India.
A British officer, Sir Dunlop was so impressed with activities of Swaminarayan and his followers, that on behalf of the government he gave 5,000 acres (20 km2) of land in Kalupur area of Ahmedabad to build this temple. When the temple was completed, the officer was so impressed by the temple that he commanded a 101 gun salute to the temple.
When the British government wanted to build a railway station in Kalupur, the temple returned part of the land, where Kalupur Railway Station stands today. The government compensated the temple by granting it 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) of land in the Narayannagar village. Although the temple had very good relations with the British government, part of the wooden carvings in the temple depict the 1857 uprising, which is often referred to as India’s first war of Independence.

https://www.bharattemples.com/girnar-junagadh-gujarat/,"Girnar, Junagadh, Gujarat
nar, also known as Girinagar (‘city-on-the-hill’) or RevatakParvata, is a group of mountains in the Junagadh District of Gujarat, India.
The Girnar mountain ranges are considered to be sacred. It is an important pilgrimage site for both Jains and Hindus, who gather here during the Girnar Parikrama festival. Girnar is one of the five major ‘tirthas’ attributed to the ‘panchkalyanakas’ of various ‘Jain tirthankaras’. Mount Girnar is a major igneous plutonic complex which intruded into the basalts towards the close of the Deccan Trap period. The rock types identified in this complex are gabbros (tholeiitic and alkalic), diorites, lamprophyres, alkali-syenites and rhyolites. The parent gabbroic magma is shown to have given rise in sequence to diorites, lamprophyres and alkali-syenites. The rhyolite, though earlier considered a product of differentiation, is now believed to be an independent magma without any genetic link with the gabbro and its variants.
 
On entering the gate, the large enclosure of the temples is on the left, while to the right is the old granite temple of Man Singh, Bhoja Raja of Kutch, and farther on the much larger one of Vastupala. Built into the wall on the left of the entrance is an inscription in Sanskrit. Some 16 Jain temples here form a sort of fort on the ledge at the top of the great cliff, but still 600 feet below the summit. The largest temple is the Neminath temple, standing in a quadrangular court 195 x 130 feet. It was built from 1128 to 1159. It consists of two halls (with two porches, called by the Hindus mandapams), and a shrine, which contains a large black image of Neminath, the 22d Tirthankar. Around the shrine is a passage with many images in white marble. Between the outer and inner halls are two shrines. The outer hall has two small raised platforms paved with slabs of yellow stone, covered with representations of feet in pairs called padukas, which represent the 2452 feet of the Gandharas, first disciples of Tirthankaras. On the west of this is a porch overhanging the perpendicular scarp. On two of the pillars of the mandapam are inscriptions dated 1275, 1281, and 1278—dates of restoration. The enclosure is nearly surrounded inside by 70 cells, each enshrining a marble image, with a covered passage in front of them lighted by a perforated stone screen.
The principal entrance was originally on the east side of the court, but it is now closed, and the entrance from the court in Khengar’s Palace is that now used. There is a passage leading into a low dark temple, with granite pillars in lines. Opposite the entrance is a recess containing two large black images; in the back of the recess is a lion rampant, and over it a crocodile in bas-relief. Behind these figures is a room from which is a descent into a cave, with a large white marble image which is mostly concealed by priests. It has a slight hollow in the shoulder, said to be caused by water dropping from the ear, whence it was called Amijhara, “nectar drop.” Neminath is said to have attained Moksha from Girnar so this place is frequently noted in Jain literature.
In the North porch are inscriptions which state that in Samwat 1215 certain Thakurs completed the shrine, and built the Temple of Ambika.
After leaving this there are three temples to the left that on the south side contain a colossal image of Rishabha Deva, the first Tirthankar, exactly like that at Palitana temples, called Bhim-Padam. On the throne of this image is a slab of yellow stone carved in 1442, with figures of the 24 Tirthankars.
Opposite this temple is a modern one to Panchabai. West of it is a large temple called Malakavisi or Meravasi, sacred to Parshwanath, built in the 15th century.North of this is another temple of Parshwanath, which contains a large white marble image canopied by a cobra, whence it is called Sheshphani, an arrangement frequently found in the South India but uncommon in North India. It bears a date of 1803. The last temple to the north is Kumarpal’s temple, built by Chaulukya king Kumarapala, which has a long open portico on the west. It appears to have been destroyed by the Muslims, and restored in 1824 by Hansraja Jetha. These temples are along the west face of the hill, and are all enclosed.[4]
Outside to the north is the Bhima Kunda, a tank 70 feet by 50 feet, in which Hindus bathe. Immediately behind the temple of Neminath is the triple one temple, Vastupala-Tejpala temple, erected by the brothers Tejapala and Vastupala (built in 1177), who also built the Dilwara Temples on Mount Abu. The plan is that of three temples joined together. The shrine has a blue black image of Mallinath, the 19th Tirthankar. Farther north is the temple of Samprati Raja, This temple is probably one of the oldest on the hill, dating to 1158. Samprati is said to have ruled at Ujjain in the end of the third century BCE, and to have been the son of Kunala, Ashoka’s third son.
Fourteen of Ashoka’s Major Rock Edicts, dating to circa 250 BCE, are inscribed on a large boulder that is housed in a small building located outside the town of Junagadh on Saurashtra peninsula in the state of Gujarat, India. It is located on Girnar Taleti road, at about 2 km (1.2 mi) far from Uperkot Fort easterly, some 2 km before Girnar Taleti. An uneven rock, with a circumference of seven meters and a height of ten meters, bears inscriptions etched with an iron pen in Brahmi script in a language similar to Pali and date back to 250 BCE, thus marking the beginning of written history of Junagadh.
On the same rock there are inscriptions in Sanskrit added around 150 CE by Mahakshatrap Rudradaman I, the Saka (Scythian) ruler of Malwa, a member of the Western Satraps dynasty (see Junagadh rock inscription of Rudradaman).The edict also narrates the story of Sudarshan Lake which was built or renovated by Rudradaman I, and the heavy rain and storm due to which it had broken.
Another inscription dates from about 450 CE and refers to Skandagupta, the last Gupta Empire.
The protective building around the edicts was built in 1900 by Nawab Rasool Khan of Junagadh State at a cost of Rs 8,662. It was repaired and restored in 1939 and 1941 by the rulers of Junagadh. The wall of the structure had collapsed in 2014.
A much smaller replica of these Girnar edicts has been positioned outside the entrance of the National Museum in Delhi.
Mount Girnar is a major igneous plutonic complex which intruded into the basalts towards the close of the Deccan Trap period. The rock types identified in this complex are gabbros (tholeiitic and alkalic), diorites, lamprophyres, alkali-syenites and rhyolites. The parent gabbroic magma is shown to have given rise in sequence to diorites, lamprophyres and alkali-syenites. The rhyolite, though earlier considered a product of differentiation, is now believed to be an independent magma without any genetic link with the gabbro and its variants.

The Dwarkadhish temple, also known as the Jagat Mandir and occasionally spelled Dwarakadheesh (Gujarati: દ્વારકાધીશ મન્દિર; Sanskrit and Hindi: द्वारकाधीश मन्दिर), is a Hindu temple dedicated to the god Krishna, who is worshiped here by the name Dwarkadhish, or ‘King of Dwarka’. The temple is located at Dwarka, Gujarat, India. The main shrine of the 5-storied building, supported by 72 pillars, is known as Jagat Mandir or Nija Mandir, archaeological findings suggest it to be 2,200 – 2,000 years old. Temple was enlarged in the 15th- 16th century.The Dwarkadhish Temple is a Pushtimarg temple, hence it follows the guidelines and rituals created by Vallabhacharya and Vitheleshnath.
According to tradition, the original temple was believed to have been built by Krishna’s grandson, Vajranabha, over the hari-griha (Lord Krishna’s residential place). The temple became part of the Char Dham pilgrimage considered sacred by Hindus in India, after Adi Shankaracharya, the 8th century Hindu theologian and philosopher, visited the shrine. The other three being comprising Rameswaram, Badrinath and Puri. Even today a memorial within the temple is dedicated to his visit. Dwarakadheesh is the 98th Divya Desam of Vishnu on the subcontinent, glorified in the Divya Prabandha sacred texts.
The town of Dwarka in Gujarat has a history that dates back centuries, and mentioned in the Mahabharat epic as the Dwaraka Kingdom. Situated on the banks of river Gomti, the town is described in legend as the capital of Lord Krishna. Evidence such as a stone block with script, the way the stones were dressed showing that dowels had been used, and an examination of anchors found on the site suggest that the harbour site dates only to historical times, with some of the underwater structure being late Medieval. Coastal erosion was probably the cause of the destruction of what was an ancient port.
Hindus believe that the original temple was constructed by Vajranabh, the great grand son of Krishna, over the residential palace of Krishna.
The current temple in Chaulukya style is constructed in 15-16th century. The temple covers area of 27 metre by 21 metre with east-west length of 29 metre and north-south width of 23 metres. The tallest peak of the temple is 51.8 m high.
As per Hindu legend, Dwarka was built on a piece of land by Krishna that was reclaimed from the sea. Sage Durvasa once visited Krishna and his wife Rukmini. The sage wished that the pair took him to their palace. The pair readily agreed and started walking with the sage to their palace. After some distance, Rukmini got tired and she requested some water from Krishna. Krishna dug a mythical hole that brought in river Ganga to the place. Sage Durvasa was furious and cursed Rukmini to remain in the place. The temple where Rukmini’s shrine is found, is believed to the place where she stood

There are three shrines of the Goddess within the temple complex. The oldest part of the shrine complex termed ‘Adyasthan’ (the original site) is a small temple enclosing a sprawling, small-leafed varakhadi tree, believed to be the site where the goddess first appeared. Adjoining this is another small temple, the madhya sthan (second or intermediate place), which houses an incised plaque representing the goddess and has a locked silver door at its entrance. This part of the temple is believed to have been built by a Maratha named Fadnavis (or an official with that title) in the eighteenth century.

Bahuchara Mata was a warrior’s daughter of the Charan caste. It is believed that Bahuchara Mata was travelling in a caravan when a marauder named Bapiya tried to molest her. Bahuchara Mata announced ‘tragu’, a form of self-immolation, and cut off her breasts, thus shedding her femininity. The marauder Bapiya was thereafter cursed with impotence. To attain penance Bapiya worshipped Bahuchara Mata by dressing and behaving as a woman, thus ultimately shedding his masculinity.

The Skanda Purana narrates that Shiva first wed Sati, the granddaughter of Brahma, and the daughter of Daksha. Daksha never liked Shiva, who symbolizing destruction and detachment, begs for food, dances in a graveyard smeared with ashes, and has no possessions, not even good clothes for himself. Daksha publicly insulted Shiva in a Yagna ceremony, and Sati immolated Herself in anger over this treatment of Her husband. The Yagna was destroyed by the ganas of Shiva led by Virabhadra. Shiva was an ascetic and his earlier marriage was conducted with great difficulty; his remarriage was out of the question. Hence Taraka believed that his boon of being killed by Shiva’s son alone would give him invincibility.
The Devas manage to get Shiva remarried to Parvati by having Kama, the God of love awaken him from his penance, incurring his wrath in the process. Shiva hands over his effulgence of the third eye used to destroy Kama to Agni, as he alone is capable of handling it until it becomes the desired offspring. But even Agni, tortured by its heat, hands it over to Ganga who in turn deposits it in a lake in a forest of reeds (shara). The child is finally born in this forest (vana) with six faces – eesanam, sathpurusham, vamadevam, agoram, sathyojatham and adhomugam. He is first spotted and cared for by six women representing the Pleiades – Kritika in Sanskrit. He thus gets named Karttikeya. As a young lad, he destroyed Taraka. He is also known as Kumara
This famous temple is situated in the center of Pehowa in Kurukshetra district of Haryana. Pehowa is at a distance of 200 kilometers from Delhi and 60 kilometers from Karnal. It is also very close to the state of Punjab as it lies on the border of the two states, Haryanaand Punjab.

Mata Mansa Devi is a Hindu temple dedicated to goddess Mansa Devi, a form of Shakti, in the Panchkula district of Haryana state in India. The temple complex is spread of 100 acres (0.40 km2) of the Shivalik foothills in the village of Bilaspur, near Mani Majra, and Panchkula, 10 km from Chandi Mandir, another noted Devi shrine in the region, both just outside Chandigarh.
It is one of the prominent Shakti temples of North India involving 7 goddesses, namely Mata Mansa Devi, Naina Devi, Jawalamukhi, Chintpurni, Brajeshwari, Chamunda Devi and Jayanti Devi. Thousands of devotees visit the shrine from various parts of the country, and especially during the Navratra mela, this number rises to lakhs everyday for the nine auspicious days.
 
There are 3 temples in the complex and main temple is the oldest. Maharaja Gopal Das Singh of Mani Majra, who was enthroned in 1783, constructed the present main temple of Shri Mansa Devi, which is situated on the Shivalik foothills in village Bilaspur, Tehsil and District Panchkula, during the period 1811–1815. At a distance of 200 meters from the main temple is the Patiala Shivalaya templewhich was constructed by Karam Singh, a Jat Sikh, the then Maharaja of Patiala in the year 1840. This temple had the patronage of Manimajra Princely State.
After the merger of Princely states into PEPSU the Patronage of State Govt. ended and the temples remained neglected. The Raja of Manimajra then appointed pujari as ‘khidmatuzar’ to serve this temple whose duty was to worship the deity of the temple.
After the merger of princely State into PEPSU these pujaris became independent in the matter of controlling and managing the affairs of the temple and the land attached to the temple. They could neither maintain this temple nor provide necessary facilities to the visiting devotees and thus the condition of the temple deteriorated day by day. So much so that there were no proper arrangements for pilgrims visiting the temple during Navaratra melas. As a result, the Government of Haryana took over the temple and set up the Shri Mata Mansa Devi Shrine Board (SMMDSB) Panchkula trust to manage the temple. The complex was in awfully neglected condition till the establishment of the Board.
The temple complex and its environment are presently looked after by Shri Mata Mansa Devi Shrine Board (SMMDSB) Panchkula which is a trust. In view of the popularity of the temple for its mythological and historical significance and also for fulfilling the wishes of the lakhs of devotees thronging to the complex, the Government of Haryana by an enactment (Haryana Act No. 14 of 1991) christened as Shri Mata Mansa Devi Shrine Act1991 took over the control of this temple to provide for better infrastructure development, management, administration and governance of Shri Mata Mansa Devi Shrine and its endowments including lands and buildings attached to the Shrine. A Shrine Board with Chief Minister of Haryana as Chairman was constituted for running of the Temple and preserving the heritage of the region.
According to a story, in the Shivalik Hills, a cow used to arrive every day and offer milk at 3 adjoining stones(Pindies) places on hilltop. It was observed by local resident that’s there were 3 Holy Shilas originated and they started Worshiping & and it was found to be the forehead of Shri Sati.
Accordingly a temple was constructed finallyMaharaja Gopal Singh of Manimajra constructed the present main temple of Shri Mansa Devi, which is situated on the Shivalik foothills in village Bilaspur, Tehsil and District Panchkula, during the period 1811-1815. At a distance of 200 meters from the main temple, the Patiala temple which was got constructed by Sh. Karam Singh, the then Maharaja Patiala in the year 1840.
This temple had the patronage of Manimajra State. After the merger of princely states into Pepsu the Patronage of State Govt. ended and the temples remained neglected.

They could neither maintain this temple nor provide necessary facilities to the visiting devotees and thus the condition of the temple deteriorated day by day. So much so that there were no proper arrangements for pilgrims.
It is said that in the place where the Mata Mansa Devi temple is today, here the next part of Sati Mata’s head was dropped. The temple of Mansa Devi was first known as the temple of Mata Sati. It is believed that King Gopaldas of Manimajra built a cave from his fort to the temple, which is about 3 kilometers long.
He used to go with his queen everyday to see Mother Sati from this cave everyday. By the time the king did not appear, the cupboard of the temple did not open.

Sidh Bawa Balak Nath, also known as Paunahari or Dudhadhari, is a Hindu deity known as the most gracious god in Hinduism. He is known as the incarnation of Lord Shiva in Kali Yuga.
Sidh Bawa Balak Nath is known as the “merciful (one who forgives all the sins)” god incarnated in Kali Yuga. He is the follower of Nath Sect.
Baba Balak Nath or Sidh Baba Balak Nath——is a Hindu deity worshipped in the northern Indian states of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh. His shrine is known as “Deotsidh”. It is situated 45 kms. away from “Hamirpur” near the border of Hamirpur and Bilaspur districts of Himachal Pradesh, India.
The Baba Balak Nath Temple is situated at the village of “Chakmoh” in the district of Hamirpur on the hilltop, in a natural cave carved in the hills, considered to be the abode of Baba. An Idol of Baba is placed in the cave.
 
The most popular story about the birth of Baba Balak Nath as ‘sidh-purush’ is associated with the Amar Katha of Lord Shiva. It is said that Lord Shiva was sharing the Amar Katha with Goddess Parvati in the cave of Amarnath, and Goddess Parvati fell asleep. A kid-parrot was there in the cave and he was listening the entire story and was making noise of ‘yes’ (“hmm..”). When the story finished, Lord Shiva found Goddess Parwati sleeping and so he understood that someone else had heard the story. He became very angry and threw his Trishul on the kid-parrot. The kid-parrot escaped from there to save his life and Trishul followed him. In the way, the wife of Rishi Vyasa was yawning. The kid-parrot entered her stomach through her mouth. The Trishul stopped, as it was unreligious to kill a lady. When Lord Shiva knew all this he also came there and narrated his problem to Rishi Vyas. Rishi Vyas told him that he should wait there and as the kid-parrot would come out, he could kill him. Lord Shiva stood there for a very long time but the kid-parrot did not come out. As Lord Shiva stood there, the whole universe got disordered. Then all the Lords met Sage Narada and requested him to request Lord Shiva to save the world. Then Narada came to Lord Shiva and prayed him to leave his anger as the child had already heard the Amar Katha.and so now he had become immortal and now nobody could kill him. Listening to this, Lord Shiva told the kid-parrot to come out and in return the kid-parrot demanded a blessing from him. Lord Shiva accepted that and the kid-parrot prayed that as he comes out as a man, any other child who gets birth at the same time would be granted all kind of knowledge and would be immortal. As Lord Shiva accepted this, a divine baby come out from the mouth of Rishi Vyas. He prayed Lord Shiva and got his blessings. This divine baby was called Sukhdev Muni later. The other babies who got birth at that time were famous as Navnatha and eighty-four siddhas (Chaurasi Sidh). One of them was Baba Balak Nath.
Connection with Lord Shiva in Dwapara Yuga : It is believed about Baba Balak Nath that he takes birth in every age (yug). He appeared as “Skanda” in Satya Yuga, as “Kaul” in Treta and as “Mahakaul” in Dwapara. In Dwapar age Baba Balak Nath was in the way to Kailash Dham with a wish to meet Lord Shiva. In the way he met with an old lady. The lady asked him where he is going. Then Baba Balak Nath who was Mahakaul told her that he is praying Lord Shiva since last three births but he had not been blessed by Lord Shiva with his appearance and so he was moving towards Kailash Dham with this very wish. The old lady told Baba that it was not easy to have a live appearance of Lord Shiva. You have to do something extraordinary. When Baba asked her what he should do,she told that Baba should stand in the foothills of the Kailash near Mansarovar and pray there. Mata Parwati used to come there on some occasions for bath. When Mata Parwati comes there he should pray her to fulfill her wish. Mata Parwati will surely try to give him something else but he should insist on his wish only. Baba Balak Nath stood for twelve gharis with the old lady and moved towards the Man Sarovar.

Shri Naina Devi Temple is located on an altitude of 1177 meters in Distt. Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh. Several mythological stories are associated with the establishment of the temple.
According to a legend, Goddess Sati burnt herself alive in Yagna, which distressed Lord Shiva. He picked the corpse of Sati on her shoulder and started his Taandav dance. This horrified all deities in the heaven as this could lead to holocaust. This urged Lord Vishnu to unleash his Chakra that cut the Sati’s body into 51 pieces. Shri Naina Devi Temple is the place where eyes of Sati fell down.
Another story related to the temple is of a Gujjar Boy named Naina. Once he was grazing his cattle and observed that a white cow is showering milk from her udders on a stone. He saw the same thing for next several days. One night while sleeping, he saw Goddess in her dreams who told him that the stone is her Pindi. Naina told about the entire situation and his dream to Raja Bir Chand. When Raja saw it happening in reality, he built a temple on that spot and named the temple after Naina’s name.
Shri Naina Devi Temple is also known as Mahishapeeth because of defeat of demon Mahishasur by the Goddess. According to the legends, Mahishasur was a powerful demon who was blessed by the boon of immortality by Lord Brahma, but the condition was that he could be defeated only by an unmarried woman. Due to this boon, Mahishasur started spreading terror on Earth and Gods. To cope with the demon, all Gods combined their powers and created a Devi to defeat him. The Devi was gifted different types of weapons by all Gods. When Mahishasur got mesmerized by the immense beauty of Devi and proposed her to marry him. Devi told him that she will marry him if he would overpower her. During the battle, Devi defeated the demon and took out both his eyes. This urged Gods to happily applaud “Jai Naina” and hence the name.
One more story is associated with Sikh Guru Gobind Singh Ji. When he left for his military campaign against Mughals in 1756, he went Shri Naina Devi and performed a Sacrificial Yagna to seek blessings of the Goddess. After getting the blessings, he successfully defeated the Mughals.

The main door of the shrine is plated with silver. In front of the main shrine, there is a huge brass bell that was presented by the King of Nepal.
In the early times, people tried to explore the fact behind these burning flames, but nothing substantial was made out. These flames are burning due to some natural jets of combustible gas. The temple came to be known as the Jwala Devi Mandir. In this temple, there is no idol because the Goddess is considered to be residing in the form of flames. This temple has nine ceaseless flames that are named as Mahakali, Annapurna, Chandi, Hinglaj, Vindhya Vasini, Mahalakshmi, Saraswati, Ambika and Anji Devi respectively.
 
Jwalamukhi refers to the deity with flaming mouth. As per the legends, the mouth of Sati fell here at the time of self-sacrifice. Ever since, the Goddess occupied the place and she manifested in nine flames. After years, one day Raja Bhumi Chand Katoch, a resident of Kangra and a great devotee of Goddess Durga, dreamt of the holy place.
He sent his men to locate the place. With the grace of the Goddess, the site was found and Raja started constructing a temple. It is believed that Pandavas also contributed in the erection of this temple. However, the construction of this temple was completed in the 19th century, when Maharaja Ranjit Singh and his son, Kharak Singh, gave the Gold and Silver for the dome and door respectively.
Legend about Akbar, the Mughal Emperor
During the ruling period of Akbar, he learned about the legends of Jwalamukhi. In a fit of anger, he tried to douse the flames with a stream of water. The great power of the Goddess, still kept the flames burning. Realizing the power of Jwala Devi, Akbar came with his army to this temple. He brought a Gold umbrella (Chatra) for the Goddess, but on offering, the umbrella turned into an unknown metal suggesting that the Goddess didn’t accept his offering.

Hidimba Devi Temple, locally known as Dhungiri Temple, also known variously as the Hadimba Temple, is located in Manāli, a hill station in the State of Himāchal Pradesh in north India. It is an ancient cave temple dedicated to Hidimbi Devi, wife of Bhima, a figure in the Indian epic Mahābhārata. The temple is surrounded by a cedar forest called Dhungiri Van Vihar at the foot of the Himālayas. The sanctuary is built over a huge rock jutting out of the ground which was worshiped as an image of the deity. The structure was built in 1553
he Hidimba Devi Temple has intricately carved wooden doors and a 24 meters tall wooden “shikhar” or tower above the sanctuary.The tower consists of three square roofs covered with timber tiles and a fourth brass cone-shaped roof at the top. The earth goddess Durga forms the theme of the main door carvings.Also depicted are animals, foliate designs, dancers, scenes from Lord Krishna’s life and Navagrahas.The temple base is made out of whitewashed, mud-covered stonework. An enormous rock occupies the inside of the temple, only a 7.5 cm (3 inch) tall brass image representing goddess Hidimba Devi. A rope hangs down in front of the rock,and according to a legend,in bygone days religious zealots would tie the hands of “sinners” by the rope and then swing them against the rock.
About seventy metres away from the temple, there is a shrine dedicated to Goddess Hidimba’s son, Ghatotkacha, who was born after she married Bhima.

The Hadimba devi temple was built in 1553 AD by Maharaja Bahadur Singh. The temple is built around a cave where Devi Hidimba performed meditation. Hidimbi was supposed to have lived there with her brother Hidimb, and not much is known about their parents.

When Lord Vishnu severed the burning body of Maa Sati into 51 pieces so that Lord Shiva would calm down and stop his Tandava, the pieces were scattered over various places in the Indian subcontinent. It is believed that Sati’s head fell at this place and is thus considered one of the most important of the 51 Shakti Peethas.
The goddess residing in Chintpurni is also known by the name of Chhinnamastika. According to Markandeya Purana, goddess Chandi defeated the demons after a fierce battle but two of her yogini emanations (Jaya and Vijaya) were still thirsty for more blood. Goddess Chandi cut off her own head to quench Jaya and Vijaya’s thirst for more blood.
She is usually shown holding her own severed head in her hand, drinking one stream of blood spurting from the arteries in her neck, while at her side are two naked yoginis, each of whom drinks another stream of blood.
Chhinnamasta, the headless goddess, is the Great Cosmic Power who helps the sincere and devoted yogi to dissolve his or her mind, including all the preconceived ideas, attachments and habits into the Pure Divine Consciousness. Cutting off the head suggests the separation of the mind from the body, that is the freedom of the consciousness from the material confines of the physical body.
According to Puranic traditions, Chhinnamastika Devi will be protected by Shiva – Rudra Mahadev in the four directions. There are four Shiva temples – Kaleshwar Mahadev in the east, Narayhana Mahadev in the west, Muchkund Mahadev in the north and Shiva Bari in the south – which are nearly equidistant from Chintpurni. This also confirms Chintpurni as the abode of Chhinnamastika Devi.
Pandit Mai Das, a Saraswat Brahman, is generally believed to have established this shrine of Mata Chintpurni Devi in Chhaproh village about 26 generations ago. Over time this place became known as Chintpurni after the eponymous deity. His descendants still live in Chintpurni and perform prayers and puja at the Chintpurni temple. These descendants are the official priests at the Temple.

In the month of Bhadon, on the eighth day of the new moon period a fair is held in the precincts of the lake that attracts thousands of pilgrims.
Manimahesh Kailash has not been successfully summitted by mountaineers and is thus remains a virgin peak. An attempt to climb the peak in 1968 by an Indo–Japanese team led by Nandini Patel was aborted. This failure is attributed to the divine prowess of the peak since it is revered as the holy mountain of Chamba according to the staunch devotees of the Manimahesh Lake and the peak.

It is also believed that Manimahesh Kailash is invincible as no one has so far scaled it, in spite of claims to the contrary and the fact that much taller peaks have been scaled, including Mount Everest. According to one legend, a local tribe, a Gaddi, tried to climb along with a herd of sheep and is believed to have been turned into stone along with his sheep. The series of minor peaks around the principal peak are believed to be the remnants of the shepherd and his sheep.
Another legend narrated is that a snake also attempted to climb the mountain but failed and was converted into stone. Devotees believe that they can view the peak only if the Lord wishes so. Bad weather covering the peak with clouds is also explained as a displeasure of the Lord

It is said that once Goddess Parvati was immersed in a deep prayer when a demon called Sudheet who was actually an ardent devotee of Shiva, approached her to pay obeisance. However seeing his demonic built, Parvati got frightened and shrieked. Hearing her shriek that echoed across the valley, Lord Shiva came to her rescue and stabbed Sudheet with his Trishula. While doing so he noticed the demon chant his name. Shiva realized he had killed his devotee and trued to bring him back to life. However, the demon replied that getting killed by the holy hands of Lord Shiva would give him ‘moksh’ or salvation. Hearing this Lord Shiva was so pleased that he announced that henceforth, Sudheet’s name would be taken before his own. And as you might have guessed by now, at the place where Parvati was worshipping, a shivling came to be known as Sudhaahadev. What a legend that was.

From there she reached Adhkuwari, where, in a small womb shaped cave she meditated and observed spiritual discipline (Tapasya) for nine long months. The exact spot where she is believed to have meditated is located at the right hand side inside the cave and is shaped like a womb. Since Vaishnavi had observed spiritual discipline in a womb shaped cave for a period of nine months, this cave has become popular by the name of Garbh Joon, which has come from the term Garbh Yoni meaning the Womb.

https://www.bharattemples.com/baidyanath-temple-baba-baidyanath-dham-deoghar-jharkhand/," Official Website:  http://babadham.org/ 
Baidyanath Temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The three important fairs held here are Shri Panchami mela held in January, Shivaratri mela held in March and the Bhadra Purnima Mela held in September. The Shivaratri festival is attended by several visitors in the course of a fortnight. In 1596, a hunter by the name of Baiju, discovered the lost lingam. Since then it came to be known as Baidyanath and people also call it Kamma Lingam – the desire fulfilling lingam.
The lingam installed inside, is of a cylindrical forming about 5 inches in diameter and projects about 4 inches from the centre of a large slab of basalt. It is not possible to ascertain how much of the lingam is buried. The top is broken and has uneven surface.
The top contains three ascending shaped gold vessels that are compactly set, and were donated by the Maharaja of Giddhaur. Besides these pitcher shaped vessels, there is a Punchsula (Five knives in Tridenta shape), which is rare. In the inner top there is an eight petaled lotus jewel called Chandrakanta Mani. There are different porches in the temple. One porch leads to the cell where the lingam is fixed. The second porch is in front with a row of pillars spanned by blocks of basalt and on the right side there is a sandstone image of nandi. There are bells fixed in the ceiling and pilgrims are supposed to pull the bell ropes to announce their approach to the divinity. To the east of the northern verandah of the temple there is a large masonry vat into which flows the water and milk offered to the lingam. The liquid in it is essentially a mix of milk, sandal paste and washing of flowers, which impart to it a fragrant smell and is treated as highly sacred.
According to Hindu mythology, Ravana went to Mount Kailash and prayed to Lord Shiva, who gave him a Jyotirlinga to take to his land, with the promise not to place the lingam anywhere else. In case that happened, the lingam would remain fixed on that spot forever. The gods, who were unhappy at the prospect of the divine lingam being established in the enemy kingdom, which would render them powerless against their adversary, worked a trick on Ravana. Meanwhile, Vishnu disguised as an old brahmin, befriended Ravana and offered himself to hold the jyotirlinga for a minute. He mistakenly handed over the lingam to a brahmin, who grounded it at Deoghar. Ravana did his best to uproot it but beyond breaking the tip he was unsuccessful. Out of frustration, he pressed it with his thumb so it went inside and got tilted slightly.
However, failing to remove the lingam, he made his obeisance to the lingam and daily he used to come from Lanka and worship the divinity. The spot where Ravana came down to the earth has been identified with Harila Jori, about four miles north of Babadham and the place where the lingam was deposited is known as Babadham.
 Legend 2:  It is said that the lingam, after the death of Ravana, used to be worshipped by a hunter Baiju, and the lingam came to be known by Baiju’s name as Baidyanath. The story of Baiju giving rise to the name of Baidyanath is more prevalent as a Santhal tradition.
 Legend 3:  Another legend states that in Satya Yuga, when Sati – the consort of Shiva and daughter of Daksha- committed suicide because of the discourtesy shown towards her husband Lord Shiv by her father Daksha. Lord Shiva stuck the corpse of his wife on the point of his trident and roamed about in a frenzy of fury. Lest Shiva’s anger and frantic movements should destroy the world, Vishnu cut the dead body with his discus into fifty-two parts, which fell in different parts of India and became Mahapithasthans. According to the legend, the heart of Sati fell at Babadham. Hence, the name Hridayapeeth.
 Legend 4:  Another legend is that, in the first age of the world, Lord Shiva manifested himself as a lingam of light at twelve different places under different names, and Baidyanath was one of those twelve places. Sati worshipped the emblem in the form of a pandanus flower on the top of the lingam and dwelt for a long time in a grove close by in order to worship it. This place is called Ketakivana.
The history of Babadham has been derived from various manuscripts and also the inscriptions at various places in the Temple area.
Man Singh remained attached to the Gidhaur dynasty for a long time and had contacts with a number of rulers of Bihar. Man Singh’s brother, Bhan Singh was married to daughter of Puran Mal. Man Singh’s interest in Babadham seems to have been determined by his love for this holy shrine because he then got a tank excavated, which is today known as Mansarovar.
Puran Mal’s inscription proves his connection with the Babadham temple. An inscription on the Baidyanath temple states that he built it at the request of the priest Raghunath Ojha. Tradition relates that the inscription was forcibly put by Puran Mal, after he had the temple repaired, to mark his ownership of the surrounding land. Raghunath Ojha was displeased with the inscription, but was unable to resist Puran Mal. Hence, after Puran Mal was gone, he had a porch created and therein set his own inscription. The legend states that the priest fasted for some days at the gate of Baidyanath who revealed to him in a dream that he should build a new porch and set up an inscription. But he claims the credit of having created the entire temple.
In 1757 after the battle of Pallsy the officers of the East India Company paid their attention to this temple. An English man, Keating was sent to look at the administration of the temple. Mr. Keating, the first English collector of Birbhum, took interest in the administration of the temple. In 1788, under Mr. Keating’s order Mr. Hesilrigg, his assistant, who was probably the first English man to visit the holy city, set out to supervise personally the collection of the pilgrim offerings and dues. Later, when Mr. Keating himself visited Babadham, he was convinced and forced to abandon his policy of direct interference. He handed over the full control of the temple to the hands of the high priest.
Baidyanathdham can be reached by train or road. Jaisidih station, on the Howrah-Patna rail line of Eastern Railway, is just 7 km away. Regular bus services from Ranchi and Patna are available. From Bhagalpur, this pilgrimage site is about 80 km.

It has a beautiful and attractive stucco sculptures.The annual fair takes place on  Gokulastami. People flock here to witness the spilling of Niru-Okuli from the top of a 35 feet high.
Again close to Venugopalaswamy shrine is a partially built temple. As you see construction has been abandoned while walls were being built. The space between the two half built walls was meant for Garbhagriha and the circle would have been the center of Sabha Mantapa. Also there was a large collection of semi-finished beams and columns, all meant for this temple. I guess Wagangera was a feudatory of Vijayanagara empire and this temple was being constructed then.

https://www.bharattemples.com/virupaksha-temple-hampi-bellary-karnataka/,"Virupaksha Temple, Hampi, Bellary, Karnataka
Virupaksha Temple is located in Hampi in the Ballari district of Karnataka, India. It is part of the Group of Monuments at Hampi, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The temple is dedicated to Virupaksha, a form of Shiva. The temple was built by Lakkan Dandesha, a nayaka (chieftain) under the ruler Deva Raya II of the Vijayanagara Empire.[1]
Hampi, capital of the Vijayanagara empire, sits on the banks of the Tungabhadra River. Virupaksha Temple is the main center of pilgrimage at Hampi, and had been considered the most sacred sanctuary over the centuries. It is intact among the surrounding ruins and is still used in worship . The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, known here as Virupaksha, as the consort of the local goddess Pampadevi who is associated with the Tungabhadra River. There is also a Virupakshini Amma temple (mother goddess) in a village called Nalagamapalle, Chittoor district, Andhra Pradesh, approximately 100 km from Tirupati.
 
The Virupaksha Temple in Hampi is dedicated to lord Shiva. The distance from Bangalore to Hampi is about 350 km. Hampi is a temple town in South India and is acknowledged as one of the World Heritage Sites of UNESCO. Virupaksha Temple is dedicated to lord Shiva. This temple was constructed in Lakkana Dandesha’s assistance who was a commander under King Deva Raya II.
Hampi is on the embankment of River Tungabhadra. The predominant centre of pilgrimage in Hampi is this esteemed temple. It is the holiest and sacred retreat.
The Virupaksha temple has survived through the years and never ceases to prosper. It is still pristine amidst the ruins that surround it. It attracts large groups of people in the month of December. The yearly chariot festival is conducted in the month of February.
At present, the main temple consists of a sanctum, three ante chambers, a pillared hall and an open pillared hall.It is decorated with delicately carved pillars. A pillared cloister, entrance gateways, courtyards, smaller shrines and other structures surround the temple.
The nine-tiered eastern gateway, which is the largest at 50 meters, is well-proportioned and incorporates some earlier structures. It has a brick superstructure and a stone base. It gives access to the outer court containing many sub-shrines.
The smaller eastern gateway leads to the inner court with its numerous smaller shrines.
Another gopuram towards north known as the Kanakagiri gopura, leads to a small enclosure with subsidiary shrines and eventually to the river Tungabhadra.
A narrow channel of the Tungabhadra River flows along the temple’s terrace and then descends to the temple-kitchen and out through the outer court.
One of the most striking features of this temple is the usage of mathematical concepts to build and decorate it. The temple has repeated patterns that demonstrate the concept of Fractals. The main shape of the temple is triangular. As you look up the temple top, the patterns divide and repeat themselves, just like you would see in a snowflake or some other natural wonders.
Krishnadevaraya, one of the famous king of the Vijayanagara Empire was a major patron of this temple. The most ornate of all structures in the temple, the central pillared hall is believed to be his addition to this temple. So is the gateway tower giving access to the inner courtyard of the temple. Inscriptions on a stone plaque installed next to the pillared hall explain his contribution to the temple. It is recorded that Krishna Devaraya commissioned this hall in 1510 AD to mark his accession. He also built the eastern gopuram. These additions meant that the central shrine came to occupy a relatively small part of the complex.The halls in the temple were used for a variety of purposes. Some were spaces in which the images of gods were placed to witness special programmes of music, dance, drama, etc. Others were used to celebrate the marriages of deities.
The temple’s history is uninterrupted from about the 7th century. The Virupaksha-Pampa sanctuary existed well before the Vijayanagara capital was located here. Inscriptions referring to Shiva date back to the 9th and 10th centuries.What started as a small shrine grew into a large complex under the Vijayanagara rulers. Evidence indicates there were additions made to the temple in the late Chalukyan and Hoysala periods, though most of the temple buildings are attributed to the Vijayanagar period. The huge temple building was built by Lakkana Dandesha, a chieftain under the ruler Deva Raya II of the Vijayanagara Empire.
Under the Vijayanagara rulers, in the middle of the 14th century, there began a flowering of native art and culture. When the rulers were defeated by Muslim invaders in the 16th century, most of the wonderful decorative structures and creations were systematically destroyed.
The religious sect of Virupaksha-Pampa did not end with the destruction of the city in 1565. Worship there has persisted throughout the years. At the beginning of the 19th century there were major renovations and additions, which included ceiling paintings and the towers of the north and east gopura

Udupi Sri Krishna Matha (Tulu:ಉಡುಪಿ ಶ್ರೀ ಕೃಷ್ಣ ಮಠ) is a famous Hindu temple dedicated to god Krishna and Dvaita Matha located in the city of Udupi in Karnataka, India.
The matha area resembles a living ashram, a holy place for daily devotion and living. Surrounding the Sri Krishna Matha are several temples namely the Udupi Anantheshwara Temple which is over a 1,000 years old
The 9-holed window, also known as the Kanakadasa window, is attached to a wall in the Chandrasala hall. The hall lends itself a sublime ambiance in aid of the holy sound made by numerous bells hanging at its arched entrance, as well as the beautiful glow of the earthen lamps burning in the hall. Devotees either sit there in meditation saying silent prayers or try to peep through the 9-holed window to get a glimpse of the Lord. One corner of the hall holds the shrine of Lord Hanuman in a meditative pose.
Overlooking the Chandrasala hall is a four-pillared raised platform with a silver roof. The platform houses the traditional deepastambam, holding the sacred oil lamp.
On the right side of the main sanctum in the path of circumambulation stands the statue of the temple’s founder Shri Madhvacharya, while on the northern side of his statue stands the shrine of Lord Panduranga.The holy tank Madhwapushkarani is placed next to the southern entrance of the temple. The eastern entrance to Shri Balkrishna’s sanctum sanctorum is strikingly beautiful flanked by a panchadhatu (5 metals) figure of Lord Vishnu mounted on his Garuda holding conch and discus. The eastern entrance usually remains closed and is open only once a year on the day of Vijaya Dashami.
The Krishna Matha was founded by the Vaishnavite saint Jagadguru Shri Madhwacharya in the 13th century. He was the founder of the Dvaita school of Vedanta. It is believed that Madhwacharya found the murti of Sri Krishna in a large ball of gopichandana.As told by Sri Madhwacharya, in his Tantrasara Sangraha, the murti is placed Pashchimabhimukha(facing West). All the other murtis in other Ashta mutts face west as well. Devotees always have darshan of Lord Krishna through the inner window, known as Navagraha kindi & the outer window known as Kanakana kindi, which is decorated by an arch named after him. A statue has also been erected. A similar window covers the immediate front of the murti and is called Navagraha kindi. It is often mistaken to be Kanakana kindi.
The temple opens by 5.30 in the morning. The unique feature of the temple is that the deity is worshipped through the silver-plated window with nine holes (Navagraha kindi).The temple also offers prasadam (lunch) in the noon.
According to mythology, when Lord Krishna’s wife Rukmini requested her husband for the idol of Balkrishna, the child form of the Lord, Shri Krishna entrusted Vishwakarma with the task of designing the idol. Vishwakarma made a beautiful idol of Balkrishna with the holy saaligrama stone and gave it to Rukmini for worship.
The idol, in the course of being worshipped by hundreds of devotees at Dwaraka with the application of sandalwood paste, got completely covered with the sandalwood paste. It is believed that this same idol is now placed at the temple.
Udupi is the railway station close to the temple. You can also consider Mangalore Railway Station. Buses and taxis are also available from here.
Mangalore is the nearest airport to Udupi. One may catch direct flights from Bangalore to Mangalore, from where one can hire a taxi to Udupi.

https://www.bharattemples.com/sringeri-chikkamagaluru-karnataka/,"Sringeri, Chikkamagaluru, karnataka
Sringeri (ಶೃಂಗೇರಿ ) also called Sri Kshetra Shringeri is a hill town and Taluk headquarters located in Chikkamagaluru district in the state of Karnataka, It is the site of the first maṭha (Sringeri Sharada Peetham) established by Adi Shankara, Hindu theologian and exponent of the Advaita Vedanta philosophy, in the 8th century CE It is located on the banks of the river Tungā .The name Sringeri is derived from Rishyashringa-giri, a nearby hill that is believed to have contained the heritage of RishiVibhandaka and his son Rishyashringa. Rishyashringa appears in an episode in the Bala-Kanda of the Ramayana where a story, narrated by Vasishtha, relates how he brought rains to the drought-stricken kingdom of Romapada
According to legend, Adi Shankaracharya is said to have selected the site as the place to stay and teach his disciples, because when he was walking by the Tunga river, he saw a cobra with a raised hood, providing shelter from the hot sun, to a frog undergoing labour. Impressed with the place where natural enemies had gone beyond their instincts, he stayed here for twelve years. Adi Shankaracharya also established mathas in the northern (at Jyotirmath, near Badrinath), eastern (at Puri) and western (at Dwaraka) quarters of India.
Jagadguru Sri Adi Shankara Bhagavatpada established the first of the four Amnaya Peethams1 at Sringeri more than twelve centuries ago to foster the sacred tradition of Sanatana Dharma.
Hallowed for all times by Sage Rishyashringa who stayed and performed Tapas here, Sringeri attracted the great Acharya with a remarkable sight.Tradition has it that after the Acharya had dispersed all the non-Vedic creeds prevailing in the country, He was on the look-out for a convenient and holy place where he could establish an institution to spread the truths of Advaita Vedanta. When the Acharya came to Sringeri, he saw an unusual sight on the banks of the Tunga. A cobra was seen spreading out its hood over a frog in labour pains, to give it shadow from the scorching mid-day sun. Struck with the sanctity of the place, which could infuse love between natural adversaries, the Acharya chose this very location to establish His first Math.
The Madhaviya Shankara Digvijayam describes that the Acharya came across many virtuous people at Sringeri and taught them the doctrine of Advaita. He then invoked the Divinity of Knowledge, Goddess Sharada and consecrated an icon of the Goddess. Thus the Peetham He founded at Sringeri in South India for fostering the Vedas and the sacred tradition of Sanatana Dharma came to be known as the Dakshinamnaya Sri Sharada Peetham.
The Acharya appointed his prime disciple, Sri Sureshwaracharya as the first Acharya of the Peetham. Since then, the Peetham has been blessed with an unbroken Guru Parampara, a garland of spiritual masters and Jivanmuktas representing Sri Adi Shankaracharya. The succeeding Acharyas have led a life of such austere penance that it has led disciples to adore in them the radiance of Sri Adi Shankara Himself.
Besides being a centre of spiritual power, Sringeri also came to be known as a great place of traditional learning owing to the presence of Goddess Sharada and the erudition of the Acharyas of the Peetham. The Acharyas were instrumental in bringing forth commentaries on the Vedas and in further expounding the Bhashyas of Sri Adi Shankaracharya. The Acharyas also wrote a number of independent works related to Advaita besides producing a number of hymns underlining their ardent devotion to the non-dual Supreme worshipped in multifarious forms. The Peetham thus came to be regarded as the Vyakhyana Simhasana, The Throne of Transcendental Wisdom. Consequently, the Birudavali hails the Acharya as the occupier of this throne. Many regard Goddess Sharada Herself to be moving in the form of the presiding Acharya of the Peetham.
In the 14th century, royal patronage to the Peetham began with the founding of the famous Vijayanagar empire under the divine guidance of the 12th Acharya, Jagadguru Sri Vidyaranya. The austerity of the Acharya influenced the rulers to such an extent that they began ruling in the name of the Acharya and granted the Peetham the rights over secular administration of the land. At the rulers’ request, the Acharya began conducting a Durbar during the Navaratri festival – an occasion deemed by the rulers to honour their Guru. Subsequently, the Acharya came to be known as the Karnataka Simhasana Prathisthapanacharya and the Peetham became a mighty institution – a Samsthanam and is known to this day as the Jagadguru Shankaracharya Mahasamsthanam, Dakshinamnaya Sri Sharada Peetham at Sringeri. Over the succeeding centuries, a number of empires and rulers including the Mysore Maharajahs Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Peshwas and the Keladi rulers and Travancore Rajas were drawn towards the Peetham and respected the Acharya as their Guru.

harmasthala Temple (Kannada/Tulu:ಶ್ರೀ ಕ್ಷೇತ್ರ ಧರ್ಮಸ್ಥಳ) (Sanskrit: क्षेत्र धर्मस्थल Kṣētra Dharmasthala) is an 800-year-old religious institution in the temple town of Dharmasthala in Dakshina Kannada, Karnataka, India. The deities of the temple are Shiva, who is referred to as Mañjunatha, Ammanavaru, the tirthankara Chandraprabha and the protective gods of Jainism, Kalarahu, Kalarkayi, Kumarasvami and Kanyakumari. The temple is considered unique since it belongs to the Shaiva sect of Hinduism. The priests are Shivalli Brahmins, who are Vaishnava, and the administration is run by a Jain Bunt family called the Pergades.
800 years ago, Dharmasthala was known as Kuduma in Mallarmadi, then a village in Belthangady. Here lived the Jain Bunt chieftain Birmanna Pergade and his wife Ammu Ballalthi in a house called Nelliadi Beedu. According to the legend, the guardian angels of Dharma assumed human forms and arrived at Pergade’s abode in search of a place where Dharma was being practised and could be continued and propagated. As was their habit, the couple hosted these illustrious visitors with all their wherewithal and great respect. Pleased by their sincerity and generosity, that night the Dharma Daivas appeared in the dreams of Pergade. They explained the purpose of their visit to him and instructed him to vacate his house for the worship of the Daivas and dedicate his life to the propagation of Dharma. Asking no questions, the Pergade built himself another house and began worshiping the Daivas at Nelliadi Beedu.
This worship of daivas continues. The Dharma Daivas again appeared before Pergade to build separate shrines to consecrate the four Daivas — Kalarahu, Kalarkayi, Kumaraswamy and Kanyakumari. Also, Pergade was instructed to choose two persons of noble birth to act as the Daivas’ oracles and four worthy persons to assist Pergade in his duties as the executive head of the shrines. In return, the Daivas promised Pergade protection for his family, abundance of charity and renowned for the ‘Kshetra’. Pergade, as desired, built the shrines and invited Brahmin priests to perform the rituals. These priests requested Pergade to install a Shivalinga beside the native Daivas. The Daivas then sent their vassal Annappa Swamy to procure the linga of Shiva from Kadri Manjunath Temple, near Mangalore. Subsequently, the Manjunatha temple was built around the linga.

This shrine has been constructed in an ancient style that attracts thousands of visitors round the year. It is situated at a distance of about fifty kilometer from the city of Mangalore. Popularly, this temple is known as ‘Padutirupati’. The term ‘Padu’ refers to west in native language of Karnataka. The rituals and rites performed in this temple are almost similar to that of Tirumala.
It is difficult to explain the divine glory and blessedness of Lord Venkataramana and Lord Srinivasa of this place. There is a common belief that any prayer that was offered with a resilient and strong belief is definitely fulfilled by this god. This temple is quite popular for its strong encouragement for all types of religious, cultural, social and academic activities that benefits people of both Karkala and outside this place. As an act of vision, the trustees of this temple inaugurated women’s education in the name of almighty, about ten decades back in Karkala.  Towards its social and academic causes, this temple has rendered helping hand to Vatsalya Seva Trust (a registered old age home), a super specialty hospital, Shree Venkataramana Goshala Trust (R), and Sri Bhuvanendra College by providing them with acres of precious temple land on lease. The last ten years, there has been remarkable changes in that took place in this temple that displays volumes of glory and eminence of this Kshetra and its God.
his temple has historical background and it dates back to 14th century when the Jain Bhairarasa Odeyars ruled Karkala and neighboring places. The Gaud Saraswat Brahmins came to Karnataka in search of place food and shelter. The Jain Odeyars donated land to the Gaud Saraswat Brahmins to lead a happy life. They also donated lands for agriculture as these Brahmin people had it as an occupation. The priests of this community namely Joishys, Puraniks and Tantris are the main people who had an existence from 14th century. There are no records or written documents about the exact date of installation of this temple.
The Gaud Saraswat Brahmins brought with them all their articles and household items which also included idol of Lord Venkataramana. One day all these Gaud Saraswat Brahmins met Jain King Immadi Bhairava and requested to grant a land to build a temple for Lord Sree Venkataramana. The Jain king happily granted them the Land for the very same purpose with some black stones which were common all over the area. This indicates that the Jains were patronized to other religions also. The land which they gave to these Gaud Saraswat Brahmins was occupied by a lady of some Mutt (religious institution for learning Vedas and Puranas). The lady heeded to the people and Jains only one condition that, “There are four powerful Ganas (Lord Shiva`s Servants) who should be worshipped and given sacrifices of coconuts, green pumpkins, Turmeric and so on; unless they would get angry. Also a yearly sacrifice should be performed as no unholy things may happen in and around here”.
The Gaud Saraswat Brahmins and Jain King agreed to lady and then temple was constructed. Initially a huge platform was built and four pillars were made to stand in the four corners. Entangled coconut leaves were made as a roof for it. The idol was installed inside the temple and prayers were offered for goodness of people. The compound wall was in its progress for building up the blocks. One day Soma Sharma returned to Karkala from Tirupathi with another idol of Lord Sree Venkataramana which was given to him by the priests at Tirumala and this was at the end of 14th century. He installed this idol with the previously installed idol of Lord Venkataramana in the newly built stone platform.
In 1500 AD, a group of dacoits attacked the temple the priests saved the main idols and valuables items by throwing them down a well in Mulki. As days progressed, they could retrieve the belongings of the temple except for the main deity. However, a person in Mulki found the statue in the well and thought that the Lord wanted to stay in this place and built the temple in Mulki. When people of Karkala came to know about this they rushed to Mulki and requested to return the idol; but by that time Mulki people had already installed the idol in Sree Veer Vittal Temlpe. People of Karkala stayed there and slept the whole night. It is said that the Lord appeared in people’s dreams and asked them to leave his statue with residents of Mulki. He seemed to have reassured them that a hermit would present them his statue in which he resides. The people of Karkala returned back and as told by the Lord himself, a hermit of Tirumala, who was a loyal devotee of Lord Venkatramana from Tirupati, came to Karkala and presented the Lord’s statue with the condition that the proceeds of the temple be given to Tirupathi. Heeding to the condition, people of Karkala undertake a pilgrimage to Tirupati each year to present the temple’s proceeds. The installation of new idol of Lord Venkataramana was done in 1537 and the renovation of the temple took place in the year 1700.

It is about a 105 km from Mangalore and can be easily reached by train,buses or taxis. Subramanya used to be called as Kukke Pattana in the past. In the ‘Shankara Vijaya’ Anandagiri observes that Sri Shankaracharya camped here for a few days during his religious expedition (Digvijaya). Shankaracharya referred to this place as ‘Bhaje Kukke Lingam’ in his ‘Subrahmanya Bhujangaprayata Stotram’. Sri Subrahmanya Kshetra has been brilliantly described in the ‘Thirthakshetra Mahimanipurana’ chapter of the Sahyadrikhanda comprised in the Sanatkumara Samhita of Skanda Purana. This kshetra is situated in the banks of the river ‘Dhara’ which originates in the Kumara mountain and proceeds to the western sea.

The devotees enter the courtyard from the doorway at the back, and circumambulate the deity. Between the sanctorum and the portico entrance, there is the Garuda pillar covered with silver. Devotees circumambulate this pillar. It is believed that this pillar was enchanted and planted there to shield devotees from the poisonous flames arising from the breath of Vasuki, who resides inside. Beyond the pillar is the outer hall, the inner hall, and then the sanctorum of Sri Subrahmanya. At the centre of sanctorum is a pedestal. On the upper daisstands the deity of Sri Subrahmanya and the deity of Vasuki and, at a somewhat lower level, the deity of Shesha.

According to one belief, after killing the demon rulers Tharaka, Shurapadmasura and their followers in a war, Lord Shanmukha reached Kumara Parvatha with his brother Ganesha and others. He was received by Indra and his followers. Indra being very happy prayed Lord Kumara Swamy to accept and marry his daughter Devasena for which the Lord readily agreed. The divine marriage took place on Margashira shudha shashti at Kumara Parvatha. Gods like Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra and many other deities assembled for the marriage and coronation ceremony of Shanmukha for which waters of several holy rivers were brought. With these waters of Mahabhisheka fell down to form a river which was later known by the popular name Kumaradhara. The great Shiva Bhakta and Serpent king Vasuki was performing tapas for years in the Biladwara caves of Kukke Subrahmanya to avoid the attack of Garuda. Following Lord Shiva`s assurance Shanmuka gave darshan to Vasuki and blessed him that he would stay with his parama bhakta in this place forever. Hence the poojas offered to Vasuki or Nagaraja are nothing but the poojas to Lord Subrahmanya.

The Chennakesava Temple, also referred to as Chennakeshava Temple, Keshava Temple or Kesava Temple, is a VaishnavaHindu temple on the banks of River Kaveri at Somanathapura, Karnataka, India. The temple was consecrated in 1258 CE by Somanatha Dandanayaka, a general of the Hoysala King Narasimha III. It is located 38 kilometres (24 mi) east of Mysuru city.
The ornate temple is a model illustration of the Hoysala architecture. The temple is enclosed in a courtyard with a pillared corridor of small shrines (damaged). The main temple in the center is on a high star-shaped platform with three symmetrical sanctums (garbha-griha), set in a square matrix (89′ x 89′) oriented along the east-west and north-south axes.[3] The western sanctum was for a statue of Kesava (missing), the northern sanctum of Janardhana and the southern sanctum of Venugopala, all forms of Vishnu. The sanctums share a common community hall (sabha-mandapa) with many pillars. The outer walls, the inner walls, the pillars and the ceiling of the temple are intricately carved with theological iconography of Hinduism and display extensive friezes of Hindu texts such as the Ramayana (southern section), the Mahabharata (northern section) and the Bhagavata Purana (western section of the main temple).
The Chennakesava temple, states George Michell, represents the climax of the development in Hoysala temple style and yet is also unique in many ways.
The northern and southern row of small shrines inside the pillared courtyard corridor consists of eighteen single shrine and one linked-double shrine each. The linked-double shrine is at the northwestern and southwestern corners of the courtyard. The western row consists of fourteen small shrines, while the eastern row consists of eight single small shrines and two linked-double shrines. In total, the Kesava temple consists of 58 small 1×1 small shrines, 4 small 2×1 linked-double shrines, 2 near entrance, and the main central temple.The 64 corridor shrines once featured Vedic and Puranic deities and rooms for pilgrims. The statues in the smaller shrines were defaced, their limbs broken or destroyed. Some of the recovered broken pieces are in a heap inside the temple. The collection includes Jaina statues in the Kayotsarga posture as well as numerous Hindu statues. The ceiling of the southern array of shrines has carvings on its ceiling, the western does not and it have an repair related inscription instead from Vijayanagara Empire era. The northern array also mostly lacks any ceiling art work except near the stairs in the middle, while the eastern array shows the greatest signs of damage and restoration with most small shrines missing but for signs of their foundation.
The main temple is built on a jagati, which symbolizes worldly platform. It is about 3 feet high, star-shaped and has stone steps at its east end for the visitor to climb up to it. Near the stairs, on each side are two dvarapala (guardian) shrines but these are damaged.
The platform around the temple serves as the circumambulation passage.
The raised jagati platform circles around the main temple with a broad walking space. It is the pradakshina patha (circumambulation path), and is supposed to be walked in a clockwise manner in order to pictorially read the Ramayana, Mahabharata and Bhagavata Puranalegends in the correct sequence.The eastern side of the platform is rectangular, while the space below the vimana (temple tower) mirrors the pointed star tower shape, with nine points on each side and two linking edges (a total of 29). A stone elephant originally stood at each star point end of the platform, but only 11 of the 15 original have survived in a damaged condition. On the sides of the star side and where two stars of the jagati platform meet were 14 mid size images likely of Nagas and 58 images of Yakshas but all of this are now missing. The temple premises stores 7 of the broken pieces found in the early 20th century.
The platform appears from distance to be five stacks from the careful moulding. From the jagati level, there are four stone steps that leads the devotee into the temple’s sabha mandapa inside.The hall appears to be rectangular, yet consists of two fused squares and a rectangle. A small square is at the entrance, the largest square in the middle, and a rectangle facing the three sanctum (garbha griya), all supported by intricately carved pillars. The main hall opens to each sanctum through a small square shaped puja mandapa. The three sanctums house Keshava (image lost), Janardhana and Venugopala. Above each of these sanctums rise the 16 pointed star shaped North Indian style tower (shikara).
Wall panel relief and molding frieze around the main Kesava Temple
The outer wall of the main temple consists of parallel horizontal bands of artwork carved above the circumambulatory platform.It has three major section, the basement band, the wall band and the top band. The lowest band in the basement section is about 6 inches tall and shows a row of elephants mostly marching to the left in the clockwise direction the devotee is expected to walk. The elephants are not exact copy of each other, rather show different natural expressions and playfulness of elephants.Some show elephants in war, throwing enemies; while others show them teasing the riders in front. The band above the elephants is of horses with armed riders, depicting a military march. In some spots, camels substitute for horses suggesting that the Hoysala had adopted camels into their army. Some spots also show battle scene with horses. In various places, the artists added humor by placing dwarfs and monkeys supporting the front raised leg of the horses.
The band above the horsemen friezes is a scroll of nature. It shows flowers, fruits, occasionally some peacocks and wildlife. The band above it is the mythology frieze. It is about 7 inches tall, around 2.5 feet above the platform, and it depicts the legends and spiritual stories found in the Ramayana (up to face 5), the Puranas particularly the Bhagavata Purana (from face 6 to 11) and lastly the Mahabharata.There are numerous panels around the temple that tell the various Hindu fables and stories.
The Somanathapura town was founded in the 13th century by a general named Somanatha (Someya Dandanayaka in some inscriptions). He was working for the Hoysala King Narasimha III.Somanatha created an Agrahara, that is granted land to Brahmins and dedicated resources to build and maintain temples therein.The town (pura) became known after the name of the patron, Somanatha-pura. The location is also referred by alternate spellings, such as Somnathpur.
In the middle of the new settlement, Somanatha built the Kesava temple and consecrated it in 1258 CE.This was a Vaishnavism tradition temple. In addition to this temple, Somanatha consecrated a Shaivism tradition related Panchalinga temple (literally, “five linga temple”) in the east-northeast corner of the land grant. He also built a fort wall around the land, but these are now in ruins.According to the inscriptions and textual evidence, Somanatha additionally built the Purahara, Narasimhesvara, Murahara, Lakshminarasimha and Yoganarayana temples in Hoysala style in the region, but all these temples except the Lakshminarasimha have disappeared, after wars between the Hindu kingdoms and Muslim Sultanates ravaged the region. The Lakshminarasimha temple is also in ruins. From the other disappeared temples, the sanctum image of Yoganarayana temple is only known surviving artwork, but it too is in a damaged form.
The Kesava temple too was badly damaged, according to 15th-century inscriptions. It was repaired in the 16th century with financial support and grants by the emperors of the Vijayanagara Empire.The repairs are evidenced by the different color of stones and quality of work in the veranda and parts of the northern tower and platform of the main temple. The repaired temple was damaged in the 19th century, then repaired again in the early 20th century by the colonial era Mysore government.

The Kesava temple is one of some 1,500 Hindu and Jain temples built by the Hoysala Empire kings in different parts of their kingdom. The other well studied Hoysala temples include those at Belur and Halebidu.
A few of the significant historical dates and circumstances around the Kesava temple is inscribed in eight stones in different parts of South India. Four of the inscriptions are found on soapstone slabs at the entrance of the temple. Two inscriptions are found in the ceilings of the veranda that surrounds the temple, one near the southeast corner and the other about the northwest corner. Another inscription is found near Harihareshwara Temple on the banks of the Tungabhadra River. The eighth inscription is found in the Shiva temple at the periphery of the original land grant, the Panchalinga temple.Most of these inscriptions confirm that the temple was operational about mid 13th century. Two inscriptions, one dated 1497 CE and another to 1550 CE describe the damage and the repairs done to this temple.
Chennakesava Temple is in Somanathapura, which is near Mysore. You can get on a bus from Bangalore, Mysore and Srirangapatna. The month of October is the right time to visit this temple.

In 1987, the society was operating from a rented house in Bangalore. In the year 1987, the leaders of the society applied to Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) for allotment of land to construct a grand temple and cultural complex. The land was allotted on 3 August 1988 – a seven-acre hillock, which was nothing but a huge piece of monolithic rock that could not be converted into sites. The BDA described it as “karaab land” (waste land). A temporary shed was constructed to set up a makeshift temple and the Deities of Sri Sri Krishna Balarama moved to this shed on the appearance day of Lord Balarama (September 1988).
 
Around 1976, devotees from different parts of India and the world had initiated activities of ISKCON in different parts of South India like Bangalore, Hubli, Madras, etc. Sankirtans in the streets, enrolling Life Members, arranging programs in the houses, and arranging large public programs in pandals were being conducted.

Hoysaleswara temple, also referred simply as the Halebidu temple, is a 12th-century Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva. It is the largest monument in Halebidu, a town in the state of Karnataka, India and the former capital of the Hoysala Empire. The temple was built on the banks of a large man-made lake, and sponsored by King Vishnuvardhana of the Hoysala Empire. Its construction started around 1121 CE and was complete in 1160 CE. During the early 14th century, Halebidu was twice sacked and plundered by the Muslim armies of Delhi Sultanate from northern India,and the temple and the capital fell into a state of ruin and neglect. It is 30 kilometres (19 mi) from Hassan city and about 210 kilometres (130 mi) from Bengaluru.
The Hoysaleswara temple is a Shaivism tradition monument, yet reverentially includes many themes from Vaishnavism and Shaktismtradition of Hinduism, as well as images from Jainism.[9] The Hoysaleswara temple is a twin-temple dedicated to Hoysaleswara and Santaleswara Shiva lingas, named after the masculine and feminine aspects, both equal and joined at their transept. It has two Nandi shrines outside, where each seated Nandi face the respective Shiva linga inside. The temple includes a smaller sanctum for the Hindu Sun god Surya. It once had superstructure towers, but no longer and the temple looks flat.The temple faces east, though the monument is presently visited from the north side. Both the main temples and the Nandi shrines are based on a square plan.The temple was carved from soapstone. It is notable for its sculptures, intricate reliefs, detailed friezes as well its history, iconography, inscriptions in North Indian and South Indian scripts. The temple artwork provides a pictorial window into the life and culture in the 12th century South India. About 340 large reliefs depict the Hindu theology and associated legends. Numerous smaller friezes narrate Hindu texts such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Bhagavata Purana. Some friezes below large reliefs portray its narrative episodes.
The artwork in Hoysaleswara temple is damaged but largely intact. Within a few kilometers of the temple are numerous ruins of Hoysala architecture. The temple along with the nearby Jain Temples and the Kedareshwara temple, along with the Kesava temple in Belur have been proposed to be listed under UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
The Hoysala period of South Indian history began about 1000 CE and continued through 1346 CE. In this period, they built around 1,500 temples in 958 centres. Halebidu was originally called Dvarasamudra (or Dorasamudra), a name derived from two Sanskrit words “Dvara” (gateway, door) and Samudra (ocean, sea, large water body). The capital used to be Belur, Karnataka, but Dvarasamudra became the established capital under king Vishnuvardhana and served as the capital of the Hoyasala Empire for nearly 300 years.
Unlike other Hoysala temples that have survived into the modern age, and despite numerous inscriptions in the temple premises, the Hoysaleswara Temple lacks a dedication inscription. It is likely lost, along with the many other features of the original temple. An inscription found about five kilometers from the temple site, near the Kallesvara temple ruins in Ghattadahalli, states that Ketamalla – officer in the employ of king Vishnuvardhana constructed this temple. It also notes that the king made grant of lands to support the construction, the operation and the maintenance of the Shiva temple in Saka 1043, or 1121 CE. It was not the only temple built in that era. The inscriptions suggest that the capital consisted of numerous other temples, both of Hinduism and Jainism traditions, along with stepwells, ponds and mantapas (mandapas, public halls) in the vicinity of the large Dorasamudhra lake.Evidence within the temple suggest that the temple was reconstructed and repaired over its history, sometimes for enhancements, sometimes to address structural issue with the towers above it (now missing), and sometimes after wars with the remains of ruined temples elsewhere in the region.It is the largest temple built by the Hoysalas that is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva in South India.
The Hoysala Empire and its capital Dvarasamudra was invaded, plundered and destroyed in early 14th century by the Delhi Sultanatearmies of Alauddin Khilji, with Belur and Halebidu becoming the target of plunder and destruction in 1326 CE by another Delhi Sultanate army of Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlaq.The territory was taken over by the Vijayanagara Empire.The Hoysala style, states James C. Harle, came to an end in mid 14th century, when King Ballala III was killed in a war with the Muslim army led by Malik Kafur. Dvarasamudra and its temples became ruins, the capital abandoned and the site became known as “Halebidu” (literally, “old camp or capital”).About 300 of the original Hoysala Empire temples survive in different states of damage, scattered around the Halebid region. Of these, states Hardy, about 70 had been studied to varying degrees of detail by 1995.
The Hoysaleswara Temple is in Halebidu, also called Halebeedu, Halebid, Dorasamudra. Halebidu is a town in Hassan district of the Indian state of Karnataka. It is about 30 kilometres (19 mi) northwest of Hassan. The temple is about 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) from Belur, Karnataka temples.Halebidu has no nearby airport, and is about 210 kilometres (130 mi) west of Bengaluru (IATA Code: BLR), about 4 hours drive accessible with a four lane NH75 highway through Hassan. Halebidu is connected by railway network at Hassan to major cities of Karnataka.

Hampi, also referred to as the Group of Monuments at Hampi, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in east-central Karnataka, India. It became the centre of the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire capital in the 14th century. Chronicles left by Persian and European travellers, particularly the Portuguese, state Hampi was a prosperous, wealthy and grand city near the Tungabhadra River, with numerous temples, farms and trading markets. By 1500 CE, Hampi-Vijayanagara was the world’s second-largest medieval-era city after Beijing, and probably India’s richest at that time, attracting traders from Persia and Portugal.[3][4] The Vijayanagara Empire was defeated by a coalition of Muslim sultanates; its capital was conquered, pillaged and destroyed by sultanate armies in 1565, after which Hampi remained in ruins.
Located in Karnataka near the modern-era city of Hosapete, Hampi’s ruins are spread over 4,100 hectares (16 sq mi) and it has been described by UNESCO as an “austere, grandiose site” of more than 1,600 surviving remains of the last great Hindu kingdom in South India that includes “forts, riverside features, royal and sacred complexes, temples, shrines, pillared halls, mandapas, memorial structures, water structures and others”.Hampi predates the Vijayanagara Empire; there is evidence of Ashokan epigraphy, and it is mentioned in the Ramayana and the Puranas of Hinduism as Pampaa Devi Tirtha Kshetra. Hampi continues to be an important religious centre, housing the Virupaksha Temple, an active Adi Shankara-linked monastery and various monuments belonging to the old city.
The toponym Hampi—traditionally known as Pampa-kshetra, Kishkindha-kshetra or Bhaskara-kshetra—is derived from Pampa, another name of goddess in Hindu theology. According to mythology, the maiden Parvati resolves to marry the loner ascetic Shiva. Her parents learn of her desire and discourage her, but she pursues her desire. Shiva is lost in yogic meditation, oblivious to the world; Parvati appeals to the gods for help to awaken him and gain his attention. Indra sends the god Kama—the Hindu god of desire, erotic love, attraction and affection—to awake Shiva from meditation. Kama reaches Shiva and shoots an arrow of desire.Shiva opens his third eye in his forehead and burns Kama to ashes. Parvati does not lose her hope or her resolve to win over Shiva; she begins to live like him and engage in the same activities—asceticism, yogin and tapasya—awakening him and attracting his interest. Shiva meets Parvati in disguised form and tries to discourage her, telling her Shiva’s weaknesses and personality problems.Parvati refuses to listen and insists in her resolve. Shiva finally accepts her and they get married.According to Sthala Purana, Parvati (Pampa) pursued her ascetic, yogini lifestyle on Hemakuta Hill, now a part of Hampi, to win and bring ascetic Shiva back into householder life. Shiva is also called Pampapati (lit. “husband of Pampa”).The river near the Hemakuta Hill came to be known as Pampa river.The Sanskrit word Pampa morphed into the Kannada word Hampa and the place Parvati pursued Shiva came to be known as Hampe or Hampi.
The site was an early medieval era pilgrimage place known as Pampakshetra. Its fame came from the Kishkindha chapters of the Hindu epic Ramayana, where Rama and Lakshmana meet Hanuman, Sugriva and the monkey army in their search for kidnapped Sita. The Hampi area has many close resemblances to the place described in the epic. The regional tradition believes that it is that place mentioned in the Ramayana, attracting pilgrims
Hampi is situated on the banks of the Tungabhadra River in the eastern part of central Karnataka near the state border with Andhra Pradesh. It is 376 kilometres (234 mi) from Bangalore, 385 kilometres (239 mi) from Hyderabad and 266 kilometres (165 mi) from Belgaum. The closest railway station is in Hosapete (Hospet), 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) away. During the winter, overnight buses and trains connect Hampi with Goa, Secunderabad and Bangalore. It is 140 kilometres (87 mi) southeast of the Badami and Aihole archaeological sites

Halebidu (IAST: Haḷēbīḍ, also Halebeedu or Halebid, literally “old capital, encampment”) is a town located in Hassan District, Karnataka, India. Halebidu (which used to be called Dorasamudra or Dwarasamudra) was the regal capital of the Hoysala Empirein the 12th century. It is home to some of the best examples of Hoysala architecture. Most notable are the ornate Hoysaleshwara and Kedareshwara temples. The city got the name “Halebidu” because it was damaged and deserted into “old capital” after being ransacked and looted twice by Islamic forces of the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th-century.
Halebiduis located in Hassan district in Karnataka. Ketumalla, the chief of staff of Hoysala Kingdom, built this temple during 1121 A.D and attributed to his king, Vishnuvardhana and queen, Shantala Devi. Even then it is learnt that it took 105 years to complete. If one stands on the platform of the temple and sees around he will see the hills opposite and two big bulls facing the temple and Ganeshafigure on the south.
It is believed that Queen Shantala Devi, was an epitome of beauty and fashion, she was also a great Bharatnatyam dancer and musician. Sculptors were inspired by this and the Shilabalikas, the dancing figures, are models of Queen Shantala Devi and her courtisans. History of Hoysalas mentions Shantala Devi had great influence in the adminstration and religious reforms during Vishnuvardhana reign. She was follower of Jainism and the King follower of Sri Vaishnaism and was influenced by Saint Ramanuja Charya.
In the 14th century, this glorious city fell into ruins with the invasion of Malik Kafur, Mughuls, from the North India. This place was ran-sacked and plundered repeatedly rendering it in ruins. Hence its name Haledid, meaning ” City in Ruins”.
Monolithic soapstone or Chloritic Schist was used for the construction of these temples.The God on the northern side temple is called as Shanthaleshwara and that on southern side is called as Hoysaleshwara.
The walls of the temple are covered with an endless depictions from Hindu mythology, animals, birds and Shilabalikas. Yet no two postures of the sculptures are similar.
Built after Shantala Devi, queen of king Vishnuvardhana. The Shantaleswara temple on the northern side stands on a platform like a casket in shining black soft stone – chlorite schist covered with variety of gods and goddesses, animals, birds and dancing girls. The temple took 190 years to build requiring skills of more than 20,000 laborers.
It has a Museum on the lawns that showcases 12th-century sculptures and gold coins in use at the time. One km from Halebid is Basti hill with Jain bastis with gleaming black stone pillars.
Also check out Basdi Halli, a group of 3  Jain temples situated very near the Hoysaleshwara temple that is famous for carved ceilings, highly polished Blackstone pillars. The Parshwanatha Swamy temple is the most important and well-preserved one. The idol is 14 feet tall and is carved out of Blackstone and bears a 7 headed serpent on its head.

https://www.bharattemples.com/gokarna-uttara-kannada-karnataka/,"Gokarna, Uttara Kannada, Karnataka
Gokarna is a small temple town on the western coast of India in the Kumta taluk of Uttara Kannada district of the state of Karnataka.The main temple and deity is Lord Shiva, who is also known as Mahabaleshwara. This temple houses what is believed to be original image of Lord Shiva’s linga (Atmalinga). There are many other temples all over this small town. Ankola and Kumta on NH66 are the main towns near Gokarna and Bhatkal and Karwar are the main cities near Gokarna where almost all trains stops.
Gokarna is known as one of the seven important Hindu pilgrimage centers. It is on what was once an unspoiled beach near the estuary of the river Aghanashini. Recently, due to the influx of tourists, the character of the town has changed; it is no longer just a centre of pilgrimage, though large numbers of devotees visit to offer prayers and worship to Lord Shiva.
Due to its laid-back, unspoiled and rustic nature many younger western tourists started visiting Gokarna about a decade ago. The beaches around Gokarna were hardly used by the locals until these mainly western tourists started coming.Enterprising locals started stores and restaurants, and now the resorts also cater to wealthier tourists.
 
The earliest history of the city is in Tretayuga, Ravana (Demon/Asura King of Lanka) reaches Kailasa and performed rigorous penance to get the “Atma Linga” from Lord Shiva, as Ravana’s mother expressed a keen desire to worship the atmalinga of Lord Shiva.[5][6] After a long penance, Shiva gave the Atma linga to Ravana as a boon and instructs Ravana to carry it home by walk, that he should never place it on the earth even for a short while failing which the linga would get eternally embedded at the place where he broke his commands.
Lord Maha Vishnu learned that Ravana will become all powerful by worshipping the ‘Atma Linga’ and menace to the world and Ravana’s conviction that nobody could defeat him, once he acquired the very power of Shiva. Maha vishnu devised a plan to install the linga somewhere and as he thought that Lord Ganapati was alone capable of doing it, he along with all the gods pleased Ganapati to execute the plan. Lord Ganapati accepts and reaches Gokarna as a Brahmin boy.
As Ravana was nearing Gokarna, Maha Vishnu who had known well that Ravana was punctual in performing his periodical rites (Sandyavandhana), hides sun with his Sudarshana Chakra (Wheel). Thinking that it was time to perform the evening rites, Ravana finds a Brahmin boy and asked him to hold the Atmalinga in his hand till he came back after finishing the rites. Ganapati agreed to hold the linga on one condition that he would do so till he would be able to bear the weight of linga and that thereafter he would call Ravana three times and if failed to come to him by then he would place the linga on the earth.
Ganapati calls Ravana three times when he was performing his rites and places the linga on the earth and he vanished. The Atmalinga at once got firmly entrenched in the earth. Ravana learned that he had been tricked by the Gods. The depressed demon king Ravana was deeply agitated and tried to pull up the linga, but the linga did not budge a little. It resulted in his throwing the coverings of the Linga to Dhareshwara, Gunavanteshwara, Murudeshwara and Shejjeshwar temples. Ravana was unable to lift the linga from the ground again and called the Shiva linga as Mahabala, one with great strength, and ever since, the linga illustrious as Mahabaleshwara. Shiva learned all these from Vayu Deva, the god of wind, and came on to Earth with Goddess Parvathi devi and his train of Gods, he visited these five places and worshipped the linga which had now taken five forms. He acknowledged that these five places would be his “Pancha Kshetras” (Five Holy Places)
A sect of Brahmins fled from the Gomantak to escape forcible conversions by the Portuguese and British and settled in and around Gokarna in the 15th century. It was part of the Sodhe and Vijayanagar kingdoms. When the Konkan region — including Goa — was occupied by the Portuguese, it became part of their rule. A few temples were destroyed by the Portuguese in 1714, rebuilt in the 18th century, and under the supervision of Guru H. H. Shrimad Anandashram Swamiji in 1928.

Ghati Subramanya kannada is an ancient Hindu temple, situated on the outskirts of Bangalore near Tubagere, Doddaballapura. It is 60 km from the city and is a popular pilgrimage centre. The uniqueness of this temple is that the prime deity Lord Karthikeya, is found together with Lord Narasimha. According to mythology, both idols are believed to have emerged from the earth. It is also an important centre in South India for snake worship. Special rituals are performed during Brahmarathotsava, i.e., on the day of Pushya shudda Shashti. Narasimha Jayanti is the other major festival celebrated here.Ghati Subramanya has a recorded history of more than 600 years. It was first developed by the Ghorpade rulers of Sandur who ruled parts of Bellary.
The high pyramid shaped gateway tower of the temple is one of the most distinctive features, a perfect example of Dravidian architecture. It is adorned with sculptures of various deities and events of Hindu mythology. It is believed that the idols have always been present here, and according to the legend, the idols of Karthikeya and Narasimha emerged from the ground and the temple was built around it. There is an anthill which is opposite the temple and devotees pour milk on it as part of one of the rituals.
One of the distinguishing aspects of this temple is that one can find two deities here – Lord Subramanya and Lord Narasimha. The idols are found in the sanctum of the temple. The idol of Lord Subramanya, in his serpentine form, faces the east while the idol of Lord Narasimha sits at the back of the former and faces the west. Devotees can view the idol of Lord Narasimha through a strategically placed mirror, allowing both deities to be worshipped at the same time. The idol of Lord Subramanya or Karthikeya is made from a single stone.
It is believed that on this spot, the deity Lord Subramanya was performing penance in the form of a snake. Lord Subramanya prayed to Lord Narasimha to provide the Naga’s family from Lord Vishnu’s vehicle, the Garuda, known for his dislike towards serpents.  Lord Subramanya’s form is that of a seven-hooded snake and it is believed that this is the region where he vanquished Ghatikasura, the demon.
The temple is believed to be more than 600 years old, according to the written records, while its origin might go back many more years. The construction of the Ghati Subramanya temple is attributed to Ghorpade, who belonged to the Sandur dynasty. It is believed that the deity appeared in the dreams of the king, revealing the whereabouts of the idols. The king, with the help of the locals, discovered the self-manifested idol of the deity and then commissioned a temple to be built around them.
The Ghati Subramanya temple is one of the most major spots for snake worship in Southern India. Brahmarathotsava is one of the important days at the temple, celebrated with special rituals. Another major festival at the Ghati Subramanya temple is Narasimha Jayanti. In December, this temple provides the venue for a fair. Agriculturists, cattle rearers and traders converge for this cattle fair from neighbouring states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Kerala, along with people from all over Karnataka.
Some of the major rituals that can be performed at the temple include Kuja Dosha, Naga Pratistha, Sarpa Dosha and Nivarana Puja. It is a firm belief of devotees that the temple should be visited by childless couples so that they may be able to conceive. Another ritual practiced here is the installation of snake idols near the temple, which is believed to be an auspicious act and offering. Visitors to the temple are greeted with the sight of thousands of such idols around the complex, planted by devotees.
Ghati Subramanya is about 60km from Bangalore. The most popular route is via Doddaballapura. If opting for a public transport, direct routes to Ghati from Bangalore are pretty less in number and one may have to change over at Doddaballapura.
The closest airport to the temple is the Bangalore International Airport, which is 48 kilometres away. From the airport, the most convenient route would be the NH648 and the journey time would be a little over an hour.
The closest railway station is in Bangalore city, 60 kilometres away. From the City Railway station, one has to traverse via the Bellary Road to reach the temple, a journey of around 90 minutes to 2 hours.
Bellary Road is the main arterial road that connects Ghati Subramanya temple to the urban areas around it. From the centre of Bangalore, the distance to the temple is around 61 kilometres. If one is travelling by bus, then there are buses that pass through Doddaballapura, where local transport needs to be arranged to cover the remaining short distance to the temple.

When we look at the history of the temple, it is believed that the temple was constructed by the Ganga Arasu people. These people also known as Vanhi Kula Kshatriyas or “Thigalas” The Archeology survey department which has undertaken a study of the stone and masonry has concluded that this temple is about 800 years old. It is also learnt that when Bangalore city was built by Kempe Gowda in the 16th century, the Kempegowda Gopuras (towers) were built in the four corners of the city keeping the Sri Dharmarayaswamy Temple vimanagopura kalasa as a centre point. The four towers are the Ulsoor tower in the North-East, The Bellary Road Tower in the North-West, The Lalbagh Tower in the South-East, The Gavipura Tower in the South-West.
The Gonga Arasu or Ganga Arasu kings used to build their towns near lakes or river beds and also, built their temples at a lower level to the ground with a further lower level pradakshina patha. Sri Dharmaraya Swamy temple was built in the Sidhikatte lake bed area & it is below the land level that existed prior to current Bangalore. It is also learnt that this old town was called as Kalyanapuri, a Town of Temples, Ponds & Religious centres. Later, it was named as “Bendhakaluru” and then as “Bengaluru”.
 
The temple resembles the architectural features of the Gangas, the Pallavas and the Vijayanagara styles. The garbhagruha is in Ganga style, the vimanagopura is in Pallava style and the mukhamantapa is in Vijayanagar style, which shows the development of this temple in three different ages. The fourth stage of development of rajagopura and sabhangana was taken up in the 20th century.
The earlier rajagopura was built well before Kempe gowda founded Bangalore in the year 1530 A.D. Kempe Gowda was an ardent devotee of this temple. Bangalore city was designed keeping this temple as its reference. The temple area was developed as Halasuru pete. This area is also known as Kalyanapuri. The temple had vast area around with a Kalyani & Dharmachatra, which however are not found today.
There were Pallavas style carved chambers between prangana & the newly built sabhangana, these carved chambers were removed and replaced by Ashtalakshmi Idols. The study quotes that the vimanagopura which is in the Pallava style matches with that of the Magadi temples & Halasuru temples built by Kempe Gowda.

The Chennakeshava Temple, also referred to as Keshava, Kesava or Vijayanarayana Temple of Belur, is a 12th-century Hindu temple in the Hassan district of Karnataka state, India. It was commissioned by King Vishnuvardhana in 1117 CE, on the banks of the Yagachi River in Belur also called Velapura, an early Hoysala Empire capital. The temple was built over three generations and took 103 years to finish. It was repeatedly damaged and plundered during wars, repeatedly rebuilt and repaired over its history. It is 35 km from Hassan city and about 200 km from Bengaluru.
Chennakesava (lit, “handsome Kesava”) is a form of the Hindu god Vishnu. The temple is dedicated to Vishnu and has been an active Hindu temple since its founding. It is reverentially described in medieval Hindu texts, and remains an important pilgrimage site in Vaishnavism. The temple is remarkable for its architecture, sculptures, reliefs, friezes as well its iconography, inscriptions and history. The temple artwork depicts scenes of secular life in the 12th century, dancers and musicians, as well as a pictorial narration of Hindu texts such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas through numerous friezes. It is a Vaishnava temple that reverentially includes many themes from Shaivism and Shaktism, as well as images of a Jina from Jainism and the Buddha from Buddhism. The Chennakeshava temple is a testimony to the artistic, cultural and theological perspectives in 12th century South India and the Hoysala Empire rule.
The Belur temple complex along with the nearby Hindu and Jain Temples at Halebidu have been proposed to be listed under UNESCO World Heritage Sites
The Hoysala period of South Indian history began about 1000 CE and continued through 1346 CE. In this period, they built around 1,500 temples in 958 centres.Belur is called Beluhur, Velur or Velapura in old inscriptions and medieval era texts. It was the early capital of the Hoysala kings. The city was so esteemed by the Hoysalas that it is referred to as “earthly Vaikuntha” (Vishnu’s abode) and “dakshina Varanasi” (southern holy city of Hindus) in later inscriptions.
One of the Hoyasala kings was Vishnuvardhana, who came to power in 1110 CE. He commissioned the Chennakeshava temple dedicated to Vishnu in 1117 CE after an important military victory in 1116 CE.According to a later mythology, Vishnuvardhana built this temple to mark his conversion to Sri Vaishnavism after coming under the influence of Ramanuja, but states Shadakshari Settar, the historical records do not support this theory.
The Chennakeshava temple at Belur took 103 years to build. Vishnuvardhana moved his capital to Dvarasamudra (now called Halebidu), where he started the construction of the Hoysaleswara Temple dedicated to Shiva. Its construction continued till he died in 1140 CE. His legacy was continued by his descendants who completed the Hoysaleswara Temple in 1150 CE, and the Chennakesava Temple, Somanathapura in 1258 CE.The Hoysalas employed many noted architects and artisans who developed a new architectural tradition, which art critic Adam Hardy called the Karnata Dravida tradition.
The Hoysala Empire and its capital was invaded, plundered and destroyed in the early 14th century by Malik Kafur, a commander of the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khalji.Belur and Halebidu became the target of plunder and destruction in 1326 CE by another Delhi Sultanate army.The territory was taken over by the Vijayanagara Empire.The Hoysala style, states James C. Harle, came to an end in the mid 14th century, when King Ballala II was killed in a war with the Muslim army led by Malik Kafur.
The Chennakeshava Temple is located in Belur taluk in Hassan district of the Indian state of Karnataka. It is about 35 kilometres (22 mi) northwest of Hassan. The temple is about 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) from Halebidu temples.Belur has no nearby airport, and is about 200 kilometres (124 mi) west of Bengaluru (IATA Code: BLR), about 3.5 hours drive accessible with a four lane NH75 highway.

https://www.bharattemples.com/cheluvanarayana-swamy-temple-mandya-karnataka/,"Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple, Mandya, Karnataka
Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple is located in Melkote in the Mandya District, Karnataka, India. The place is also known as Thirunarayanapura. It is built on rocky hills known as Yadavagiri or Yadugiri overlooking the Cauvery valley. It is about 30 miles (48 km) from Mysore and 97 miles (156 km) from Bangalore.
The temple is a square building of large dimensions but is very plain and only sparsely ornamented with carvings or sculptures. The presiding deity is Cheluva Narayana Swamy, also known as Tirunarayana ತಿರುನಾರಾಯಣ or Cheluvapille Raya ಚೆಲುವಪಿಲ್ಲೆ ರಾಯ, a form of Lord Vishnu. It appears from inscriptions that in the early centuries after the temple was built, the Lord was also known by the name Ramapriya, but this usage has now completely disappeared.
The utsavamurthi ಉತ್ಸವ ಮೂರ್ತಿ, which is a metallic idol used for processions and certain religious rituals, represents the deity ‘Cheluvanarayana Swamy. According to a legend, this metallic image was once lost but was recovered by Sri Ramanujacharya. The annual report of the Mysore Archaeological Department states on the strength of epigraphic evidence, that the presiding deity of this temple was already a well known object of worship even before Sri Ramanujacharya worshipped at the shrine in December 1098 CE. and even before he came to the Mysore region and that very probably he used his influence to rebuild or renovate the temple. From the lithic records of the period, existence of Tamil influence and Vaishnava worship in the area are also evident.
The temple is richly endowed, having enjoyed the special patronage of the Rajas of Mysores. As early as 1614, King Raja Wodeyar I(r.1578–1617), who first acquired Srirangapatna and accepted the Srivaishnava pontiff as his guru, handed over to the temple and to the Brahmins at Melkote, the estate granted to him by Vijayanagar Emperor Venkatapati Raya. While that estate was lost when Zamindari was abolished in the 1950s, the temple still possesses many properties and valuables, in particular an extremely valuable collection of jewels. On one of the pillars of navaranga of the Narayanaswami temple is a bas-relief about one and a half feet high, of Raja Wodeyar, standing with folded hands, with his name inscribed on the base. He was said to have been a great devotee of the presiding deity and a frequent visitor to the temple. A gold crown set with precious jewels was presented by him to the temple. This crown is known as the Raja-mudi (royal crown), a play on the name of Raja Wodeyar, the donor. According to legend, King Raja Wodeyar was observed entering the sanctum sanctorum of the Lord on the day of his death, and was seen no more afterwards. From the inscriptions on some of the gold jewels and on gold and silver vessels in the temple it is learnt that they were presents from Krishnaraja Wadiyar III and his queens. Krishnaraja Wodeyar III also presented to the temple a crown set with precious jewels. It is known after him as Krishnaraja-mudi. The Vairamudi (“diamond crown”), another crown of great value, seems to be older than the Raja-mudi and the Krishnaraja-mudi. However, it is not known who presented it to the temple.
All the three crowns are kept in the safe custody of the Government and brought to the temple on specific annual occasion for adoring the image of Cheluvanarayana Swamy. The vairamudi festival, which is the chief annual celebration is attended by more than 400,000 people.
Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple is over 1000 years old. The engravings on the temple mention the historical evidence of the temple.  On one of the columns of navaranga is a bas relief, of Raja Wodeyar. This name is etched on the base. He was said to be a great devotee of the presiding deity and a constant visitor to the temple.
Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple is a lavishly empowered temple by the Wodeyar dynasty, the Royals of Mysore. The temple has the most valuable collection of jewels given to the lord by Mysore king Raja Wodeyar. Wodeyars gifted two gold crowns knows as Vairamudi or Vajramukuta and Krishnaraja-mudi to the lord. There is another crown, must older than these two crowns gifted to the lord by some unknown person. All the three crowns are currently in the custody of the Government and are brought to the temple on special occasions.
Vairamudi Festival is one such occasion when the crowns are taken out and adorned on the deities, post which the deities are taken out for a procession in the town. This festival is attended by kore than 4 lakh people every year. An interesting fact is that the main priest is blindfolded before the crowns are taken out, as it is believed that no one should see the crown until it is adorned by Tirunarayana, the main deity.
This temple is one of the most important shrines for the Vaishnavas. It is also listed an Abhimana Sthalam. The main idol of the temple is that of Narayana, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Mostly visites by the Vishnu believers or the Vashinavites, this ancienttemple was built if phases including the royals of Mysore. Vairamundi Seva Festival is organized on a huge scale during the time of March-April. A chariot procession is taken out during this festival. The deities of the temple are:
The presiding deity of this temple is of Lord Vishnu also known as Tirunarayana or Cheluvaraya. Utsavamurthy, the small metal idol, represents the main deity. Sri Chelunarayana Swamy was worshipped in Kritayuga by Lord Dattatreya and got the name of Vedadri. In Tretayga it was called as Narayanadri succeeded by Yasavadri as it was idolized by Balrama and Krishna. In Kalyuga it was idolized by Saint Ramanujacharya.
As far as mythology is concerned it is believed that Lord Rama visited this temple. This fact has been mentioned in the ancient texts as well as can be found in the manuscripts kept in the temple. Lord Rama along with his two sons Lav and Kush visited this temple and offered a flower tribute to the temple deities. And hence Cheluvanarayana Swamy was originally called as Ramapriya.
As per another legend utsavamurthy, the metal statue symbolizing the chief deity got lost during the Mughal invasion. It was then found by Ramanujacharya from Bibi Nachiyaar, Mohammed Shah’s daughter. She was given this idol as a toy, however rather than playing she was found worshipping it. Mohammed Shah gave the idol back to Ramanujacharya and it was then Bibi Nachiyaar came from Delhi to Melukote in search of it. She collapsed and died the moment she saw the idle. It is believed that her soul in the form of flame united with her idol. As an honor to her devotion, her idol is placed next to the feet of main idol.The temple has more than one Brahmotsavam and follows Pancharatra Agama. Thuni Thengol and Puliyogare are the popular prasadams of the temple.

The Puranas state the wicked asura Vatapi was killed by sage Agastya, and it refers to this area as Vatapi and Agastya Tirtha. In the Ramayana, Agastya and Lopamudra are described as living in Dandaka forest, on the southern slopes of Vindhya mountains. Rama praises Agastya as the one who can do what gods find impossible. He is described as the sage who used his Dharma powers to kill demons Vatapi and Ilwala after they had jointly misled and destroyed 9,000 men.
In the Mahabharata, sage Agastya is described in the epic as a sage with enormous powers of ingestion and digestion. To kill men, asura Vatapi used to become a goat and his brother Ilvala would cook him. Then, Vatapi would recollect in the stomach and tear himself out from the inside of the victim, killing the victim. When Agastya arrives, Ilvala offers the goat again. He kills Vatapi by digesting the meal as soon as he ate, giving Vatapi no time to self organize.Agastya, in the legends of Mahabharata, kills the demons Vatapi and Ilvala much the same mythical way as in the Ramayana.
Badami Chalukyas was founded in AD 540by Pulakeshin I (AD 535–566), an early ruler of the Chalukyas is generally regarded as the founder of the Early Chalukya line. An inscription record of this king engraved on a boulder in Badami records the fortification of the hill above “Vatapi” in 544. Pulakeshin’s choice of this location for his capital was no doubt dedicated by strategic considerations since Badami is protected on three sides by rugged sandstone cliffs. His sons Kirtivarman I (AD 567–598) and his brother Mangalesha (AD 598–610) constructed the cave temples.Kirtivarman I strengthened Vatapi and had three sons Pulakeshin II, Vishnuvardhana and Buddhavarasa, who at his death were minors, thus making them ineligible to rule, so Kirtivarman I’s brother Mangalesha took the throne and tried to establish rule, only to be killed by Pulakeshin II who ruled between AD 610 to 642.[5] Vatapi was the capital of the Early Chalukyas, who ruled much of Karnataka, Maharashtra, parts of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh between the 6th and 8th centuries. The greatest among them was Pulakeshin II (AD 610–642) who defeated many kings including the Pallavas of Kanchipuram.And was later killed by Narasimha Pallavi 1 in the famous battle of vatapi
Old Kannada inscription of Chalukya King Mangalesha dated 578 CE at Badami cave temple no.3
The rock-cut Badami Cave Temples were sculpted mostly between the 6th and 8th centuries.
Badami has eighteen inscriptions, among them some inscriptions are important. The first Sanskrit inscription in old Kannada script, on a hillock dates back to 543 CE, from the period of Pulakeshin I (Vallabheswara), the second is the 578 CE cave inscription of Mangalesha in Kannada language and script and the third is the Kappe Arabhatta records, the earliest available Kannada poetry in tripadi (three line) metre.one inscription near the Bhuthanatha temple also has inscriptions dating back to the 12th century in Jain rock-cut temple dedicated to the Tirtankara Adinatha.

The Badami cave temples are a complex of four Hindu, a Jain and possibly Buddhist cave temples located in Badami, a town in the Bagalkot district in northern part of Karnataka, India. The caves are considered an example of Indian rock-cut architecture, especially Badami Chalukya architecture, which dates from the 6th century. Badami was previously known as Vataapi Badami, the capital of the early Chalukya dynasty, which ruled much of Karnataka from the 6th to the 8th century. Badami is situated on the west bank of a man made lake ringed by an earthen wall with stone steps; it is surrounded on the north and south by forts built in later times.
The Badami cave temples represent some of the earliest known examples of Hindu temples in the Deccan region. They along with the temples in Aihole transformed the Malaprabha River valley into a cradle of temple architecture that influenced the components of later Hindu temples elsewhere in India.
Caves 1 to 4 are in the escarpment of the hill in soft Badami sandstone formation, to the south-east of the town. In Cave 1, among various sculptures of Hindu divinities and themes, a prominent carving is of the Tandava-dancing Shiva as Nataraja. Cave 2 is mostly similar to Cave 1 in terms of its layout and dimensions, featuring Hindu subjects of which the relief of Vishnu as Trivikrama is the largest. The largest cave is Cave 3, featuring Vishnu-related mythology, and it is also the most intricately carved cave in the complex. Cave 4 is dedicated to revered figures of Jainism. Around the lake, Badami has additional caves of which one may be a Buddhist cave. Another cave was discovered in 2015, about 500 metres (1,600 ft) from the four main caves, with 27 Hindu carvings.
 
The Badami cave temples are located in the town of Badami in the north-central part of Karnataka, India. The temples are about 88 miles (142 km) east of Belgavi (IATA Code: IXT), and 87 miles (140 km) northwest of Hampi. The Malaprabha River is 3 miles (4.8 km) away. The cave temples are 14 miles (23 km) from the UNESCO world heritage site Pattadakal and 22 miles (35 km) from Aihole – another site with over a hundred ancient and early medieval era Hindu, Jain and Buddhist monuments.[2]
Caves on the cliff above Agastya Lake
Badami, also referred to as Vatapi, Vatapipura, Vatapinagari and Agastya Tirtha in historical texts,the capital of Chalukya dynasty in the 6th century, is at the exit point of a ravine between two steep mountain cliffs. Four cave temples in the escarpment of the hill to the south-east of the town were carved into the cliff’s monolithic stone face. The escarpment is above a man made lake called Agastya Lake, created by an earthen dam faced with stone steps. To the west end of this cliff, at its lowest point, is the first cave temple.The largest and highest cave is Cave 3, which is further to the east on the northern face of the hill.The fourth cave, Cave 4, is a few steps down further east.
The cave temples, numbered 1 to 4 in the order of their creation, in the town of Badami – the capital city of the Chalukya kingdom (also known as Early Chalukyas) – are dated from the late 6th century onwards. The exact dating is known only for Cave 3, which is a temple dedicated to Vishnu. An inscription found here records the dedication of the shrine by Mangalesha in Saka 500 (lunar calendar, 578/579 CE).[9] The inscription, written in the old Kannada language,has enabled the dating of these rock cave temples to the 6th century.[3][11][12] This makes the cave the oldest firmly-dated Hindu cave temple in India.
The Badami caves complex is part of a UNESCO-designated World Heritage Site candidate under the title “Evolution of Temple Architecture – Aihole-Badami-Pattadakal” in the Malaprabha river valley, considered a cradle of temple architecture that formed the model for later Hindu temples in the region.The artwork in Caves 1 and 2 exhibit the northern Deccan style of the 6th and 7th centuries, while those in Cave 3 simultaneously represent two ancient Indian artistic traditions; the northern Nagara and the southern Dravida styles.Cave 3 also shows icons and reliefs in the so-called Vesara style, a fusion of ideas from the two styles, as well as some of the earliest surviving historical examples in Karnataka of yantra-chakra motifs (geometric symbolism) and colored fresco paintings.The first three caves feature sculptures of Hindu icons and legends focusing on Shiva and Vishnu,while Cave 4 features Jain icons and themes.The Badami cave temples are carved out of soft Badami sandstone on a hill cliff. The plan of each of the four caves (1 to 4) includes an entrance with a verandah (mukha mandapa) supported by stone columns and brackets, a distinctive feature of these caves, leading to a columned mandapa, or main hall (also maha mandapa), and then to the small, square shrine (sanctum sanctorum, garbha ghriya) cut deep inside the cave.The cave temples are linked by a stepped path with intermediate terraces overlooking the town and lake. The cave temples are labelled 1–4 in their ascending series; this numbering does not reflect the sequence of excavation.

Adhishakthyathmaka Sri Annapoorneshwari Temple or the Horanadu Annapoorneshwari Temple is located on the banks of River Bhadra in Hornadu, in the Western Ghats of Karnataka. The town of Horanadu is also popular as “Sri Kshethra Horanadu” in respect of the Goddess.  Sri Annapoorneshwari is the Goddess of food and nourishment.
The word Annapoorna is a conjunction of two words- Anna meaning food or grains and Purna meaning complete and perfect.
Further, she is praised and glorified in several ancient scriptures like Annapurnamantratsava, Maha Tripurasiddhanta, Annapurna Kavacha, Annapurnahavamti, Annapurnamalininaksatramalika, Bhairvahyantantra, Rudrayamala, and Sivarahasya. Even though people wildly worship her, only a few temples are there for her as the presiding deity. The other famous Temples dedicated to Sri Annapoorneshwari are the Annapoorna Devi mandir and the Kasi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi.
To visit the Horanadu Annapoorneshwari Temple, devotees have to climb a few steps to reach the main temple complex. The Gopuram of the Temple also has various sculptures of Gods and Goddesses. A mandapam is there on the left of the main entrance. A queue complex next to the Mandapam is also there for entry into the main hall where Annadanam takes place every day.

Hereditary Dharmakartharu priests started in this temple from past 400 years. The same family is serving and preserving the temple since then. Dharmakartharu have played an instrumental role in refurbishing the temple as well as in performing the rituals here. The temple premise was small and unknown to many till the fifth Dharmakartharu Sri D.B. Venkatasubba Jois repaired and revived the temple. The goddess icon was reestablished in 1973 on the auspicious day of Akshaya Tritiya.
The temple is also known as Adhishakthyathmaka Sri Annapoorneshwari Ammanavara Temple or Sri Kshetra Horanadu Temple. It is believed that the sage Agastya in 8th century established the icon of the goddess here.
As per legend, the god Shiva and his wife Parvati – the presiding goddess of food as Annapoorna, had an argument. Shiva declared everything in the world including food to be maya (illusion). To prove food is not illusion, Parvati disappeared resulting in the nature to become still. Neither climate changed nor plants grew, causing drought in the world. Taking pity on the world, Parvati appeared and distributed food to all.
According to another tale, Shiva beheaded the god Brahma. Brahma’s skull got stuck in Shiva’s hand. He was cursed that till the skull is not full of food or grains, it will stick to his hands. Shiva went everywhere and asked for food but the skull was never full. So he finally went to this temple and Annapoorna filled the skull with grains and reversed Shiva’s curse.

Ganesh Chaturthi is the main festival celebrated at Anegudde temple and Sankashta Chaturthi is also celebrated with great devotion. On the Chauthi / Chaturthi (the 4th day after the full moon) of every lunar month, special poojas are held at the temple. Devotees frequently perform several poojas and take prasadam at this temple. As myths run, a devotee (Vishweshwara Upadhyaya) was living here, regularly worshipping Lord Ganesha. One day, a Brahmin Vatu (young boy) appeared in his dream and said that he was hungry. Taking Upadhyaya with him, the Vatu disappeared near a stone in Nagachala. Getting surprised by this unusual dream, he started off on the next morning in search of the spot, where the Brahmin boy disappeared in his dream. It was his usual path, which led to a pond, where he used to take his bath, bring sacred water for Abhishekam and collect flowers for worshipping Lord Ganesha. Soon he found the same granite stone, which he witnessed in his dream and was covered by wild flowers giving it a divine appearance. Impressed by this sight, Upadhyaya hurriedly took his bath in the nearby pond and worshipped the deity and offered wild flowers and fruits. He continued to do so for a long time. One day, he saw a cow standing there pouring in milk from her udder on the deity. After this incidence, his devotion became stagnant and worshiped his God with more devotion. People generously donated land on which a straw hut was constructed to enable Upadhyaya to continue his worship. Thus started a new tradition of worship at Kumbhashi, which did not stop at any stage.
Kumbhasi is located on the NH-17 ( now NH-66 ) at a distance of 96 km from Mangalore, 9 km from Kundapur, and 30 km from Udupi. Kumbhasi is located about 400 km from the state capital Bengaluru.
Frequent bus service is available from Mangalore /Udupi /Kundapur to Kumbhasi.
One can either walk from Kumbashi bus stand using the stairs or hire an auto rickshaw to reach Anegudde temple at the top of the hill.

https://www.bharattemples.com/amrutesvara-temple-amruthapura-chikkamagaluru-karnataka/,"Amrutesvara Temple, Amruthapura, Chikkamagaluru, Karnataka
The Amruteshvara temple also spelt “Amrutesvara” or “Amruteshwara”, is located in the village of Amruthapura, 67 km north of Chikmagalur town in the Chikkamagaluru district of the Karnataka state, India. Located 110 km from Hassan and 35 km from Shimoga on NH 206, Amruthapura is known for the Amruteshvara temple . The temple was built in 1196 C.E. by Amrutheshwara Dandanayaka (lit, “commander”) under Hoysala King Veera Ballala II.
The temple is a built according to Hoysala architecture with a wide open mantapa (hall).The temple has an original outer wall with enique equally spaced circular carvings. The temple has one vimana (shrine and tower) and therefore is a ekakuta design,and has a closed mantapa (hall) that connects the sanctum to the large open mantapa.
It is medium-sized Hoysala temple with certain vastu features similar to the Veera Narayana Temple, Belavadi in mantapa structure and size. The open mantapa has twenty nine bays,[3] and the closed mantapa has nine bays with a side porch that leads to a separate shrine on the south side. The shrine is square in shape has the original superstructure (shikhara) which is adorned with sculptures of Kirtimukhas (demon faces), miniature decorative towers (aedicule). Below the superstructure, the usually seen panel of Hindu deities is absent. The base of the wall has five mouldings which according to art critic Foekema is an “older Hoysala style”.[4] The sukanasi, the tower on top of the vestibule that connects the sanctum to the closed mantapa (the Sukanasi appears like the nose of the superstructure),has the original Hoysala emblem of “Sala” fighting the lion.
The rows of shining lathe turned pillars that support the ceiling of the mantapa is a Hoysala-Chalukya decorative idiom.[8] The mantapa has many deeply domed inner ceiling structures adorned with floral designs. The outer parapet wall of the open mantapa has a total of hundred and forty panel sculptures with depictions from the Hindu epics. Unlike many Hoysala temples where the panels are small and carvings in miniature, these panels are comparatively larger. The Ramayana is sculpted on the south side wall on seventy panels, with the story proceeding quite unusually, in anti-clockwise direction. On the north side wall, all depictions are clockwise, a norm in Hoysala architectural articulation. Twenty five panels depict the life of the Hindu god Krishna and the remaining forty five panels depict scenes from the epic Mahabharata.
Ruvari Mallitamma, the well known sculptor and architect is known to have started his career here working on the domed ceilings in the main mantapa. The large stone inscription near the porch contains poems composed by medieval Kannada poet Janna who had the hororific Kavichakravarti (lit, “emperor among poets”) .
The temple was constructed in the 12th century by the commander Amrutheshwara Dandanayaka, during the rule of Veera Ballala II, the Hoysala King. The rise of the Hoysalas also coincided with the spread of this certain design philosophy which can to this day be seen across the state of Karnataka. One of Karnataka’s most famous sculptors was Mallitamma, and it is believed that he started his artistic career at Amruthapura, suggesting the beginning of a golden architectural age.
The main deity of the temple is Lord Shiva and the shivalinga at the temple is a 300-year-old Trimurti brought from the River Kandikevale in Nepal. The idol of Sharadha Devi sits next to the shiva linga. Some of the important rituals performed at the Amrutesvara temple include Bilva Archane and Kumkuma Archane.
Aksharbhyasam is also another ritual that can be performed at this temple. Devotees visit the temple for many reasons, including concerns related to wealth and diseases. It is also believed that those whose children are suffering in education can come and offer prayers here. Some of the thanksgiving gifts left at the temple include sarees.
The temple is located in a quiet spot close to the reservoir of the Bhadra River. This 12thcentury structure was built following the many hallmark features of Hoysala architecture. Many experts describe this temple as part of the older Hoysala style of architecture.
The oldest parts of the Amrutesvara Temple are the porch, garbhagriha, sukhanasi and the navaranga, and as time progressed there were more additions and embellishments made. The wide hall or mantapa is one of the important parts of a Hoysala style temple. The mantapa of the Amrutesvara Temple has many impressive pillars, ornate and lathe-turned.
The open and closed mantapas feature many inner-ceiling structures that have detailed floral designs. The square shrine sits below a super structure of shikhara. The shikhara of the Amrutesvara Temple is decorated with intricate carvings of demon faces and mini towers.
On one of the temple towers, one can find the emblem of the Hoysalas, the Sala battling a lion. On the sukhanasi tower, visitors can also find an elaborate panel depicting Shiva slaying Gajasura. The wall reliefs of the temple give visitors a glance at the important Hindu beliefs and stories that defined the spiritual leanings of the Hoysala dynasty.
One of the important pieces of sculptures on the temple can be found on the southern wall, a detailed depiction of events from the Ramayana, the story’s linear timeline represented in an anti-clockwise direction, quite unusual.
The north side has more panels depicting important Hindu mythology. One can find the events of the Mahabharata here depicted this time in a clockwise direction along with panels chronicling the life of Krishna.
A stone inscription in the complex is considered a great example of old Kannada poetry, the work attributed to Janna, one of the most famous poets of the region.

Apart from Chikmagalur, the nearest big towns are Shimoga (35 kilometres away) and Tarikere so these remain important transit points when travelling to Amruthapura.
The closest airport by distance is in Mangalore, 220 kilometres away. However the route from Bangalore International Airport would take a similar time to cover despite being around 282 kilometres away, due to more open roads in long stretches.
The nearest railway station to the temple is located 11 kilometres away in Tarikere. From the railway station it is a short 20 minute journey to the temple via NH206. Trains that ply between Shimoga and the cities of Bangalore and Mysore usually stop at Tarikere.
From Bangalore city, the best route to reach the temple by road is via the NH79 and SH24, stops which include Tumkur. It is 260 kilometre journey and should take close to 5 hours to complete. One can also catch a direct bus to Shimoga and then find local transport that would take them to the temple.
The Chikmagalur district is one of the most scenic in the beautiful state of Karnataka. Enjoy a visit to the Amrutesvara temple to witness its architectural glory in the backdrop of the serene landscape. Karnataka is a medley of cultures and belief-systems, moulded by a multi-layer history and there are many spiritual and historical sites to explore here, Amrutesvara Temple being on that list.

https://www.bharattemples.com/aihole-bagalkot-karnataka/,"Aihole, Bagalkot, Karnataka
Aihole (pronounced “Eye-hoé”), also referred to as Aivalli, Ahivolal or Aryapura, is a historic site of ancient and medieval era Buddhist, Hindu and Jain monuments in north Karnataka (India) dated from the fourth century through the twelfth century CE.Located around an eponymous small village surrounded by farmlands and sandstone hills, Aihole is a major archaeological site featuring over one hundred and twenty stone and cave temples from this period, spread along the Malaprabha river valley, in Bagalakote district.
Aihole is 22 miles (35 km) from Badami and about 6 miles (9.7 km) from Pattadakal, both of which are major centers of historically important Chalukya monuments. Aihole, along with nearby Badami (Vatapi), emerged by the 6th century as the cradle of experimentation with temple architecture, stone artwork, and construction techniques. This resulted in 16 types of free-standing temples and 4 types of rock-cut shrines.The experimentation in architecture and arts that began in Aihole yielded the group of monuments at Pattadakal, a UNESCO world heritage site.
Over one hundred Aihole temples are Hindu, a few are Jain and one is Buddhist. These were built and coexisted in close proximity. The site is spread over about 5 square kilometres (1.9 sq mi).The Hindu temples are dedicated to Shiva, Vishnu, Durga, Surya and other Hindu deities. The Jain Basadi temples are dedicated to Mahavira, Parshvanatha, Neminatha and other Jain Tirthankaras. The Buddhist monument is a monastery. Both Hindu and Jain monuments include monasteries, as well as social utilities such as stepwellwater tanks with artistic carvings near major temples
Aihole is referred to as Ayyavole and Aryapura in its inscriptions and Hindu texts from 4th to 12th century CE, as Aivalli and Ahivolal in colonial British era archaeological reports.
Aihole has been a part of Hindu mythologies. It has a natural axe-shaped rock on the Malaprabha river bank north of the village, and a rock in the river show a footprint.Parashurama, the sixth Vishnu avatar, is stated in these legends to have washed his axe here after killing abusive Kshatriyas who were exploiting their military powers, giving the land its red color.A 19th-century local tradition believed that rock footprints in the river were those of Parashurama.A place near the Meguti hillocks show evidence of human settlement in prehistoric period. Aihole has historical significance and has been called a cradle of Hindu rock architecture.[20]
The documented history of Aihole is traceable to the rise of the Early Chalukya dynasty in 6th century. It became, along with nearby Pattadakal and Badami, a major cultural center and religious site for innovations in architecture and experimentation of ideas. The Chalukyas sponsored artisans and built many temples in this region between the 6th and 8th centuries.Evidence of wooden and brick temples dating to 4th-century have been unearthed. Aihole started the experimentations with other materials such as stone around the 5th century when the Indian subcontinent saw a period of political and cultural stability under the Gupta Empire rulers. Badami refined it in 6th and 7th centuries. The experimentations culminated in Pattadakal in the 7th and 8th centuries becoming a cradle of fusion of ideas from South India and North India.
The Aihole fort rubble walls on Meguti hill enclosing the 5th-6th century Jain temple.
After the Chalukyas, the region became a part of the Rashtrakuta kingdom who ruled in the 9th and 10th century from the capital of Manyakheta. In the 11th and 12th century, the Late Chalukyas (Western Chalukya Empire, Chalukyas of Kalyani) ruled over this region.Even though the area was not the capital or in immediate vicinity from 9th to 12th centuries, new temples and monasteries of Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism continued to be built in the region based on inscriptional, textual and stylistic evidence. This likely happened, states Michell, because the region was prosperous with a substantial population and surplus wealth.
Aihole was fortified by Late Chalukya kings in the 11th and 12th centuries, in an approximate circle. This indicates the strategic and cultural importance of Aihole to the kings whose capital was far away. Aihole served as a hub of Hindu temple arts in this period with guild of artisans and merchants called the Ayyavole 500, celebrated for their talent and accomplishments in the historic texts of the Deccan region and South India.
An 8th-century Shiva temple was renamed Lad Khan Temple after a Muslim commander of Bijapur Sultanate who briefly lived here.
In the 13th century and thereafter, the Malprabha valley along with much of Deccan became a target of raids and plunder by the Delhi Sultanate armies devastating the region. From the ruins emerged the Vijayanagara Empire which built forts and protected the monuments, as evidenced by inscriptions in the fort at Badami. However, the region witnessed a series of wars between Vijayanagara Hindu kings and Bahmani Muslim sultans. After the collapse of Vijayanagara Empire in 1565, Aihole became a part of the Adil Shahi rule from Bijapur, with some of the Muslim commanders using the temples as residence and their compounds as garrison for storing weapons and supplies. A Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva came to be called Lad Khan temple, named after the Muslim commander who used it as his operational hub, and a name that has been used ever since.In late 17th-century, the Mughal Empire under Aurangzeb gained control of the region from Adil Shahis, after which Maratha Empire gained control of the region. It again changed hands with Haider Ali and Tipu Sultan conquering it in late 18th century, followed by the British that defeated Tipu Sultan and annexed the region.
The monuments at Aihole-Badami-Pattadakal show the existence and a history of interaction between the early northern style and early southern style of Hindu arts.According to T. Richard Blurton, the history of temple arts in north India is unclear as the region was repeatedly sacked by invaders from Central Asia, particularly the Muslim incursion into the subcontinent from 11th-century onwards, and “warfare has greatly reduced the quantity of surviving examples”. The monuments in this region are amongst the earliest surviving evidence of these early religious arts and ideasArchaeological site
Aihole became a significant archaeological site and attracted scholarly attention after the British India officials identified and published their observations.The colonial era scholars hypothesized that the Apsidal shape Durga temple in Aihole may reflect the adoption by Hindus and Jains of the Buddhist Chaitya hall design and the influence of early Buddhist arts. They also identified historically significant 7th-century inscriptions.
For much of the 20th-century, Aihole remained a neglected site. Until the 1990s, the site consisted of houses and sheds built up to and in some cases extending into the historical monuments.The walls of the ancient and medieval temples were shared by some of these homes. Investments in infrastructure, land acquisition and relocation of some residences has allowed limited excavations and created a few dedicated archaeological parks including one for the much studied Durga temple at Aihole. Excavated ancient and medieval era artifacts and broken temple pieces, including a complete life size nude Lajja Gauri in birthing position and with a lotus head,now resides in an ASI museum next to the Durga temple in Aihole. Many temples and monasteries continue to be set midst narrow streets and congested settlement.
The Aihole site and artwork are a major source of empirical evidence and comparative studies of Indian religions and art history in the Indian subcontinent.The Aihole’s antiquity, along with four other major 5th to 9th century sites – Badami, Pattadakal, Mahakuteshvara and Alampur – is significant to scholarship relating to archaeology and religions. These, states George Michell, display a “meeting and fragmentation of different temple styles and the creation of local variants”. This fusion and exploration of arts and ideas later became a part of northern and southern Indian architectural repertoires
The Aihole monuments are located in the Indian state of Karnataka, about 190 kilometres (118 mi) southeast of Belgaum and 290 kilometres (180 mi) northeast from Goa. The monuments are about 14 miles (23 km) from Badami and about 6 miles (9.7 km) from Pattadakal, set midst rural villages, farms, sandstone hills and Malprabha river valley. The Aihole site preserves over 120 Hindu, Jain and Buddhist monuments from the 4th—12th century CE. The region is also a site for prehistoric dolmens and cave paintings.
Aihole has no nearby airport, and is about 4 hours drive from Sambra Belgaum Airport (IATA Code: IXG), with daily flights to Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai.[14][15] Badami is the closest town connected by railway and highway network to major cities of Karnataka and Goa.[6] It is a protected monument under the laws of the Indian government, and managed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

The temple history is connected to events at the end of the Dwapara Yuga when Lord Krishna was about to end His leelas on earth and Kali Yuga was about to start. Many Sages led by Sage Valakhilya started doing penances and worship of Lord Krishna in Kunjavana, a forest on the banks of the Sharavathi river seeking the Lord’s help in reducing the effects of the Kali Yuga. During the course of the worship, many obstacles were encountered and thus Sage Valakhilya sought the advice of Sage Narada who advised to seek the blessings of Lord Ganesha in removing all obstacles.
Sage Narada selected a site in Kunjavana which the Devatas had visited earlier. The Devatas had even created two lakes called Chakra Tirtha and Brahma Tirtha. Sage Narada and the other Sages created a new late called as Deva Tirtha. Sage Narada invited all the Devatas and requested Parvati Devi to send Lord Ganesha. Lord Ganesha was pleased with the fire sacrifice and rituals done to propitiate him and thus, agreed to be present in the forest always to prevent any obstacles in the worship of the Sages. One more lake was created now to get water for the worship of Lord Ganesha and was called Ganesha Tirtha.

The main idol has a striking appearance with four arms having all the attributes of Vishnu. In the southwestern corner and on the north-eastern side of the outer enclosure are the shrines of Sasta and Shiva with Nandi.
Sage Narada, after paying his respects to Lord Narayana, left Vaikuntam to see Brahma. Enraptured by the sweet music of Narada, Narayana followed him unobserved. When Narada reached Brahmaloka, Brahma saw Narayana following his son Narada and offered salutations to him, at which Vishnu, realizing the awkward situation, suddenly disappeared. Brahma found that the person whom he had revered was his own son, Narada. The ‘Prajapathis’ who were laughing at this incident were cursed by Brahma that they would be born on earth and suffer the miseries of human beings. Narada advised them to perform penance at the place he himself would select for them. Narada threw his ‘Valkalam’ (bark upper garment) into the air and at the place where it fell down, they consecrated a temple for Janardanaswamy (a name of Vishnu). Hence the name Varkala is a corruption of ‘Valkala’, but the name came into prominent usage.
According to the legend, attracted by the music from Narada’s Veena, Lord Vishnu started following him and reached Satyaloka. Seeing Lord Vishnu, Brahma prostrated before him. Lord Vishnu soon realized that he has reached Satyaloka but did not realize that Lord Brahma is prostrating before him and left back to Vaikunta. It seemed as if Lord Brahma is falling towards the feet of Narada and all the present ‘Devas’ laughed. This made Brahma angry and he cursed Devas to be born as humans in the earth. Devas repented their folly and begged to be forgiven. Brahma replied that the curse would be withdrawn when they do a penance to please Lord Janardana. Devas asked where that place is where they should do the penance. Brahma told them that the place where Sage Narada’s ‘Vastra’ falls will be the sacred place. It is Varkala where his ‘Vastra’ fell and Devas did the penance accordingly to get relieved of the curse.
According to Mahabharata, Balabhadran has visited the place for pilgrimage.

Nammalwar, the 9th-century poet and one among the 12 Vaishnavite saints of the Alvar tradition, has composed ten hymns in praise of Lord Padmanabha. Some well-known scholars, writers, and historians, like the late Dr. L.A.Ravi Varma of Travancore, have expressed the view that this Temple was established on the first day of Kali Yuga (which is over 5000 years ago). The legends of the Temple are handed down through the centuries. One such legend which finds a place in the old palm leaf records of the Temple, as also in the famous grantha entitled “Ananthasayana Mahatmya”, mentions that it was consecrated by a Tulu Brahmin hermit named Divakara Muni. On the 950th year of Kali Yuga, a reinstallation of the idol was done. In the 960th Kali year, King Kotha Marthandan built the Abhisravana Mandapam. The principal deity Vishnu is enshrined in the “Anantha Shayanam” posture, the eternal yogic sleep on the serpent disheshan. Sree Padmanabhaswamy is the tutelary deity of the royal family of Travancore. The titular Maharaja of Travancore Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma is the trustee of the temple. The name of the city of Thiruvananthapuram in Malayalam translates to “The City of Lord Ananta”, referring to the deity of Padmanabhaswamy Temple.

I got down and enquired at a shop there regarding the way to the temple. They pointed to a small road going towards the left and I took that path.
After five minutes of walk through the village road, there was a left turn and then suddenly the temple became visible. The place looked very deserted except for few children who were playing cricket on the road, using a big rock in place of stumps. I got inside the temple and realized that the sanctum sanctorum was already closed after the madhyahna puja. There were few villagers sitting inside. They told that the temple will open again at 5 and I could take rest under some peepal tree there until then, and take food from the hotel in the main road. I told them that it would be too late for me if I have to wait till evening, so I would just have a pradakshina around the outer temple and then go back.

The Vaikom Mahadeva Temple is a temple for the Hindu god Shiva in Vaikom, Kerala.

The belief is that if a devotee worships at these three temples before ‘Ucha pooja’, all the wishes are fulfilled.
The Vaikom Mahadeva temple is one of the few temples which is held in reverence by both Shaivaites and the Vaishnavaites. Vaikom’s Shiva is fondly called Vaikkathappan. The Shiva Linga here is believed to be from the ‘Treta yuga’ and considered as one of the oldest temples in Kerala where pooja has not been broken since inception.
One of the biggest temples in Kerala, the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple has a courtyard of about eight acres of land. The premises levelled with river sand is protected by compound walls with four Gopuras or towers on all the four sides. The Sreekovil is round in shape roofed with copper sheets and with two chambers. The Mukha Mandapa – the first chamber is built in shaped stone and single piece woods.

Pleased with his penance Lord Siva granted all the boons he asked, and presented him with three great Siva Lingas drawn out of Him. Assuring that He will ever be present in them, Lord Siva disappeared, asking Khara to worship the Lingas to attain Moksha. When Khara was returning south from Himalayas with the three Lingas, one in his right hand, one in left hand and other by the neck, he felt tired and rested awhile. After rest when he tried to pick up the lingas, they wouldn’t budge. He realized that it was Shiva’s maya and when called unto, the heavens spoke thus, “I shall remain here giving Moksha to whom so ever  take refuge in Me”. Khara having attained Moksha entrusted the holy Lingas to the custody of Maharshi Vyaghrapada who had followed him invisibly and asked the sage to protect and worship them

Mural paintings depicting various episodes from Mahabharata can be seen inside the temple.The shrines and the Kuttambalamdisplay vignettes carved in wood. The temple, along with the mural paintings, has been declared as a National Monument by Indiaunder the AMASR Act.According to popular local lore, this is the first temple built by Parasurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu. Thekkinkadu maidan, encircling the Vadakkunnathan Temple, is the main venue of the Thrissur Pooram.Non-Hindus are not allowed to enter into the temple.
In the year 2012 the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has recommended 14 sites, including Vadakkumnathan Temple and palaces, from Kerala to include in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites
The temple is situated in an elevated hillock in the centre of Thrissur City and is surrounded by a massive stone wall enclosing an area of nearly 9 acres (36,000 m2). Inside this fortification, there are four gopurams facing four cardinal directions. Between the inner temple and the outer walls, there is a spacious compound, the entrance to which is through gopurams. Of these, the gopurams on the south and north are not open to the public. The public enter either through the east or west gopuram. The inner temple is separated from the outer temple by a broad circular granite wall enclosing a broad corridor called Chuttambalam. Entrance into the inner temple is through a passage through the corridor.
The temple is famous for the rarity of the temple murals, of which the Vasukishayana and Nrithanatha murals are of great importance and are worshipped daily.The temple also houses a museum of ancient wall paintings, wood carvings and art pieces of ancient times.A study done by Archaeological Survey of India on two paintings in the temple has revealed that it is 350 years old.

The Koothambalam is used for staging Koothu, Nangyar Koothu and Koodiyattam, an ancient ritualistic art forms of Central Kerala. According to folk lore, before the new Koothambalam was built, there used to be an old and dilapidated structure. The then Diwan T. Sankunni Menon ordered to demolish the structure and construct a new Koothambalam. He gave this task to Velanezhy Nambudiri, a famous Thachushasthranjan or master craftsman. He prepared a mental sketch and built a beautiful Koothambalam there. Velanezhy Illom is in Venganellur Gramam, Chelakkara town.
The story of the origin of the Vadakkunnathan Temple is briefly narrated in Brahmanda Purana and there are references to it in some other works also. Though there are differences between these accounts on the details, all agree on the central fact, namely, that the temple was founded by Parashurama. Parashurama exterminated Kshatriyastwenty one times. In order to cleanse himself and balance his karma he performed a yajna at the end of which he gave away all the land to Brahmins as dakshina. He wanted to retire to some new land to perform tapasya and so he requested the Lord of the seas and oceans Varuna to throw up a new piece of land from the sea.
The famous Sri Mula Sthana where for sometime the linga of Shivaremained. Later, the ruler of Kochi Kingdom decided to shift the linga to a more convenient place and enclose it in a good temple.
According to another version, some sages approached him at the end of the yajna and requested him to give them some secluded land. Parashurama then made the request to Varuna for their sake. Varuna gave him a winnow (surpa) and asked him to hurl it into the sea, as he did a large territory of land was at once thrown up by the sea; this territory that rose out of the sea was Kerala. It was then known by the name “Surparaka”, from the word, “Surpa” meaning winnow.
According to some other accounts, Varuna asked Parashurama to hurl his axe into the sea. Parashurama now wanted to consecrate this new land. So he went to Mount Kailash to his guru, Lord Shiva and requested him to take abode in Kerala and thereby bless the region. Shri Shiva accompanied by his wife Parvati, his sons Ganesha and Subrahmanya and his parashadas went along with Parashurama, to satisfy the desire of his disciple. Shiva stopped at a spot, now Thrissur, for his seat and later he and his party disappeared and Parashurama saw a bright and radiant Shiva linga (aniconic symbol of Shiva) at the foot of a huge banyan tree. This place where Shiva first manifested his presence through the linga is in Smskrth (Sanskrit) known as the Sri Moola Sthana.
For sometime, the linga remained at Sri Mula Sthana at the foot of a huge banyan tree. The ruler of Cochin Kingdom then decided to shift the linga to a more convenient place and enclose it in a temple. Arrangements were soon made to reinstall the deity in the new place. But there was an initial difficulty. The linga could not be removed without cutting off a large part of the banyan tree. While cutting the branches of the tree, there was the danger of a piece of it falling on the idol and damaging it. When the ruler and the others did not know what to do, the Yogatirippadu came forward with a solution. He lay over the deity so as to cover it completely and asked the men to cut the tree. The cutting began and to the wonder of all not a piece of the tree fell anywhere near the deity. The deity was moved with all due rituals and installed in the new place where it has remained till now. Then a temple was built according to the rules laid down in the Shastras.

The temple is glorified in Divya Prabandha, an early medieval Tamil collection of hymns by the Vaishnava Alvars. It is one of the 108 divyadesas (tirupatis) dedicated to god Vishnu, who is worshipped as Navamukunda Perumal at Tirunavaya. The temple has no pond or well, and water from the river is used for all rituals. The presence of Cherutirunavaya Brahma – Siva Temples across the River Ponnani at Tavanur makes it a trimutri sangama. The river bank in the temple are considered as holy as Kasi and the ritual offering practices for forefathers (bali tarpana/sradha puja) are similar to the ones done there. Ganapati (Adi Ganesa/Gajendra), Lakshmi(“Malarmangai Nachiyar”) and Ayyappa Swami are the associated pratishthas. Goddess Lakshmi has a separate sri kovil in the temple, unlike most of the other Narayana-Lakshmi temples.

As per Kerala rituals, only the main priest called tantri and the second priest called melsanti alone can enter the sri kovil.
The central temple has a square plan with the base built of granite, superstructure built of laterite and conical roof made of terracotta tile supported from inside by a wooden structure. The roof projects in two levels to protect the inner structure from heavy rains during monsoon.

The Vishnu is called “Navamukunda Perumal/Tevar” as it is believed that the idol was the ninth one to be installed in the temple by a group of nine Hindu yogis known as “Navayogis”. The first eight idols sank into the Earth as soon as they were placed there and the ninth sank to its knees before it was forcibly stopped. As the location of the sunken idols were not known, devotees used to make pradikshina on their knees. Even Alvancheri Tamparakkal and Tirunavaya Vaddhyans were not exempted from this practice.Tirunavaya is also known as called “Navayogisthala”.

The temple deity is the presiding deity of Arattupuzha Pooram. It is believed that the idol here was worshipped by Lord Krishna, another avatar of Lord Vishnu in Dwarka. Along with Lord Rama, there are shrines for Lord Shivaas Dakshinamoorthy, Lord Ganesha, Lord Sastha and Lord Krishna.
Triprayar temple used to be owned & administered by the 3 famous Nambudiri families namely Cheloor mana, Janappilly Mana and Punnappilly Mana before it was handed over to the Cochin Devaswom Board. Still, the heads of these three families serve as the Ooralans of the temple and take part in the rituals and festivals in accordance with the customs.[
Triprayar temple is rich in wood carvings. The sreekovil is circular in shape with a copper covered conical roof and is surmounted by a golden Thazhikakkudam. The circular sanctum has several sculptural representations of scenes from the Ramayana with a dynamic and lively vitality of design and form a lavish decoration and an integral part of the architectural edifice of the temple. Its walls are decorated with beautiful mural paintings. The namaskara mandapa, which is copper-plated, is profusely sculptured -having 24 panels of woodcarvings representing navagrahas.
The diety Lord Rama in the Triprayar Temple is popularly known as Triprayarappan or Triprayar Thevar. The idol of Lord Rama was initially worshipped by Lord Krishna at Dwaraka. After the swargarohana of Lord Krishna the idol was immnesed in the sea. Later some fisher men got the idol from the sea near Chettuva region of Kerala and the local ruler Vakkayil Kaimal constructed a temple at Triprayar and installed the idol. The image of Rama (Triprayar Thevar) resembles the Chaturbhuja Vishnu form with four arms, bearing a conch(Panchajanya), a disc (Sudarsana), a bow (Kodanda) and a garland respectively. It is believed that the deity worshipped here possesses some of the aspects of Shiva too. It was after killing the asura, Khara that Sri Rama got both the Shaiva and Vaishnava aspects. Thus Triprayar Thevar is also called Khara Samhara Moorthy. It is also believed that the portrayal of Rama with a garland held in the image’s hand is also suggestive of aspects of Bhrahma and hence the deity is said to be a manifestation of the Trimoorthis. The image is adorned with necklaces and other fine jewelry. Images of Sreedevi and Bhudevi are on either side. There is an image of Dakshinamoorthy, in the sanctum facing the south. Dakshinamoorthy is commonly found in Shiva temples. There is also a lamp behind the image which is kept burning all the time. Because of these and also because of the fact that people got relief when troubled by evil spirits chathan-the deity is believed to have a Shiva aspect also.
The original idol of Rama was subject to severe wear with the passage of time. Astrological investigations however revealed that the Lord did not desire to have change of the vigraha. Therefore a raiment was made in Panchaloha and the same now covers the original stone image.

https://www.bharattemples.com/sree-poornathrayeesa-temple-tripunithura-kerala/,"Sree Poornathrayeesa Temple, Tripunithura, Kerala
Sree Poornathrayesa temple (in Malayalam:ശ്രീ പൂര്‍ണ്ണത്രയീശ ക്ഷേത്രം) is situated in Tripunithura, Kochi, the capital of the former Kingdom of Cochin. The temple is considered among the greatest temples in Kerala and was first among 8 royal temples of erstwhile Kochi Kingdom. The deity was also considered as National deity of Cochin and protector guardian of Tripunithura.
The temple is famous for its yearly Utsavams or festivals. The main one is the Vrishchikoltsawam,[1] which is conducted every year in the month of Vrishchikam (November–December), kicking off the ‘Ulsava’ Season in Kerala. And this Vrishchikolsavam is the biggest temple festival of Ernakulam District and one of the biggest temple festivals of Kerala also.
The deity in this temple is Lord Vishnu who is in the form of Santhanagopala Murthy. It is well believed that childless couples will be blessed with children on praying Poornathrayesan.
The temple is designed in accordance of Kerala temple architecture. A major fire occurred in 1920, which destroyed much of the original structure particularly the sanctum sanctorum which was built extensively in wood. This led to redesigning the temple with concrete structure, for the first time in Kerala. Designed by the illustrious architect Late Sri Eachara Warrier, the temple was redesigned with concrete structure, covered cleverly with copper plates, wooden panels and granite tiles to recreate the traditional structure feeling.
The side walls of sanctum sanctorim where heavily decorated with large brass sheets with statutes of gods and goddess, while the roof is covered with copper sheets, while the entrances of sanctum sanctorum were covered with gold sheets.The first floor of the two-storied gopuram consists of a mandapam (Dias), and eight beautifully carved wooden pillars support the Mandapam.
Sree Poornathrayeesa Temple is the only temple in South India where you can see an odd pose of Lord Vishnu, sitting under the shade of five royal hoods of the divine serpant, Ananthan, whose folded body itself acts as the throne for the God. Devotees worship the almighty here as “Santhaana Gopaala Moorthy”(Savior of infants). Anecdotes say that this beautiful idol of Sree Poornathrayeesa was presented to Arjuna by Lord Vishnu, while the former sought the help of the Supreme being to give rebirth to the ten children of a brahmin (believed to be a member of Puliyannur Illom, ancestral home of the chief priest of the temple). Arjuna along with the ten children and the holy idol returned in his chariot and handed over the children to the brahmin. Later a temple was built here in memory of this event and the sanctum-sanctorum (Sree Kovil) of this temple (presently known as Muthukulangara) is in the form of a chariot. Arjuna sent lord Vighnesha to search for a holy place for the installation of the idol of lord Vishnu. First they kept the idol in a palace, half a kilometer west to the main temple and now it is popularly known as ‘Poonithura Kottaram’.
Attracted by the holiness of the ancient Vedic Village, POORNAVEDAPURAM, (now Tripunithura), lord Vighnesha himself occupied the place. Angry Arjuna kicked him aside to the southern side of the sanctum and installed the idol in that holy place surrounded by mustard fields. He then plucked some mustard seeds and crushed them to get oil for lighting lamp in front of the idol. Devotees consider the evershining “Valia Vilakku” situated in front of the idol, as the oil lamp lighted by Arjuna. Burnt oil of this traditional lamp possesses great medicinal value. The deity, ever since has been living in the minds and hearts of devotees as Santhanagopala Moorthy, blessing the needy, infertile couples with children.
Stories relating Sree Poornathrayeesa as the elder brother of the goddesses of Chottanikkara and Pishari temples are also popular among the people. Lord Poornathrayeesa is also believed to be wedded to a Namboothiri girl,”Nangema”, from Vadakkedathu Mana. Dieties from local temples like “Perumthrikovil”(Lord Shiva) and “Pishari kovil”(Lakshmi) will come here during their annual festive occasions to participate in a combined procession, locally termed as “Sankara Narayana Vilakku”(Shiva and Vishnu) and “Laksmi Narayana Vilakku”(Goddess Laksmi and Lord Vishnu) respectively. Aarattu (the holy bath of the diety) after the annual festival of Sree Poornathrayeesa takes place at the temple pond of Chakkamkulangara Shiva Temple, nearly half a kilometer North-East to Sree Poornathrayeesa Temple.
The entire structure of the temple except the West Gopuram (Gateway) was redesigned in the year 1921 by the great architect Late Sri Eachara Warrier. Before that the temple structure was in a reduced form with tiled roof and wooden ceiling. The east gopuram was also smaller than the present structure.
In 1920 (Malayalam year 1096) the entire structure other than the west gopuram was destroyed in an accidental fire. Fortunately the devotees could save the main idol from fire by covering it with a huge vessel coated with clay.The other idols were shifted to Puthan Bunglow (Family temple of the Cochin Royal Family) and the King of Cochin state ordered to reconstruct the temple structure by completely avoiding the accident-prone wood works. In accordance with the King’s order Eachara Warrier skillfully blended the traditional architecture with the modern means of construction like concrete and reconstructed the temple with fireproof materials like Copper, Concrete, Granite and Bronze.
The west gopuram which could survive the devastating fire of 1920 is believed to be built by some divine powers and the age of this structure, still remains a mystery. Here the devine sculptures in their crude form bear a unique beauty.The first floor of this two storied gopuram consists of a mandapam (Dias), supported by eight beautifully carved wooden pillars.
Traditions say that Lord Vishnu offered the idol of Sree Poornathrayeesa to Arjuna (the third of the five Pandava brothers), when he sought the help of the Lord to give rebirth to the ten children of a Brahmin. The ten children and the sacred idol were taken by Arjuna in his chariot and he handed over the children to the Brahmin. In memory of this event, a temple was built with a sanctum-sanctorum in the form of a chariot. Lord Ganesh was sent by Arjuna to search a holy place for the installation of Lord Vishnu. Earlier, the idol was kept in a palace which is situated at the west of the main temple and now it is known as Poonithura Kottaram.
Lord Ganesh, who was attracted by the holiness of the ancient Vedic Village, Poornavedapuram (now Tripunithura), tried to occupy the place for himself. However, Arjuna pushed him away to the southern side of the sanctum and installed his idol there. This is different from the usual custom, where Lord Ganesh has a separate shrine at the south-western side of the inner prakaram. As the place was bounded by mustard fields, Arjuna used some mustard seeds to get oil for lighting lamp. You can see a Valia Vilakku situated in front of the idol. Folks say that the burnt oil of this traditional lamp contains medicinal value.
Legends reveal that Sree Poornathrayeesa is the elder brother of the Goddesses of Chottanikkara and Pishari temples. It is also believed that the Lord was married to a Namboothiri girl, Nangema, from Vadakkedathu Mana. During the annual temple festival occasions, deities from Perumthrikovil (Lord Shiva) and Pishari kovil (Lakshmi) visit here for a combined procession. This is locally called as Sankara Narayana Vilakku (Shiva and Vishnu) and Laksmi Narayana Vilakku (Goddess Lakshmi and Lord Vishnu). The Aarattu (the holy bath of the deity) of Sree Poornathrayeesa takes place at the temple pond of Chakkamkulangara Shiva Temple, which is situated north-east of the Sree Poornathrayeesa Temple.
The MOOLASTHAANAM or ‘Origin’ is located in Poonithura Sree Krishna Temple, which is 1.5 km west of Sree Poornathrayeesha temple. The then ruler shifted the deity from the place to the existing location.

Sabarimala is a Hindu temple complex located at the Periyar Tiger Reserve in Kerala, India, considered to be one of the holiest in Hinduism.It is the largest annual pilgrimage in the world with an estimated 17–30 million devotees visiting every year.Some estimates put the number of annual visitors as high as 50 million.The temple is dedicated to the god Ayyappan also known as Dharma Sastha, who according to belief is the son of Shiva and Vishnu.[6] The traditions of Sabarimala are a confluence of Shaivism, Shaktism, Vaishnavism, and other Śramaṇa traditions.
Sabarimala Sree Dharma Sastha Temple, dedicated to Lord Ayyappa, is the most famous and prominent among all the Sastha temples in Kerala.
The temple is situated on a hilltop (about 3000 feet above sea level) named Sabarimala in Pathanamthitta district, which is unique. The temple is open to people belonging to all religions. There is a place near the temple; east of Sannidhanam (the abode of Lord Ayyappa), dedicated to Vavar (a close friend of Lord Ayyappa) which is called Vavaru Nada, an epitome of religious harmony. Another unique aspect of this temple is that it is not open throughout the year. It is open for worship only during the days of Mandalapooja, Makaravilakku and Vishu.
It is said that the pilgrims have to observe celibacy for 41 days before going to Sabarimala. Pilgrims take the traditional forest routes as well as the one from Pamba which is less physically challenging to reach the temple.
The temple is situated on a hilltop amidst eighteen hills at an altitude of 480 m (1,574 ft) above sea level, and is surrounded by mountains and dense forests. The dense forest (Periyar Tiger Reserve) around the temple is known as Poongavanam. Temples exist in each of the hills surrounding Sabarimala. While functional and intact temples exist at many places in the surrounding areas like Nilakkal, Kalaketty, and Karimala remnants of old temples survive to this day on remaining hills.
In response to a PIL filed in 1991, the Kerala High Court had observed the restriction of entry of women ( in the 10-50 age group ) to the temple was in accordance with the usage prevalent from time immemorial. In lieu of this, it had directed the Devaswom Board to uphold the customary traditions of the temple. However, on 28th September 2018, the Supreme Court of India, overturned the ban on the entry of women, declaring that the selective ban on women was unconstitutional and discriminatory.
The temple is open for worship only during the days of Mandalapooja (approximately 15 November to 26 December),Makaravilakku or “Makara Sankranti” (14 January) and Maha Vishuva Sankranti (14 April), and the first five days of each Malayalam month.
The Sannidhanam (main temple) is built on a plateau about 40 feet high.The temple was rebuilt after arson and vandalism in 1950 thought to have been carried out by Christians according to the police investigation. No charges were brought.and the earlier stone image of the deity was replaced by a panchaloha idol, about 1 and half feet, made from an alloy from five metals.
The temple consists of a sanctum sanctorum with a gold-plated roof and four golden finials at the top, two mandapams, the balikalpura which houses the altar. In 1969, the flag staff (dhwajam) was installed.
The shrine of Kannimoola ganapathi prathishta is south-west to The Sreekovil of the Sannidhanam. Devotees offer part of the broken coconut (Neythenga) to the fireplace (Azhi). Ganapathi homam is the main offering.
The shrine of the Lord of snakes, Nagarajav is placed adjacent to the malikappuram temple. Pilgrims after the Darsan of Lord Ayyappa and Kannimoola Ganapathi, make their darsan and give offerings to Nagarajav.
The Pathinettu thripadikal or the 18 sacred steps is the main stairway to the temple. As per the custom followed, no pilgrim without “Irumudikkettu” can ascend the 18 sacred steps. In 1985, the 18 steps were covered by panchaloka and later covered with gold. The stairway in northern gate is open for those who do not carry an “Irumudikkettu”.
The temples of Lord Ayyappan’s trusted lieutenants Karuppu Sami and Kadutha Swami are positioned as his guards at the foot of the holy 18 sacred steps.
The temple of Maalikapurathamma, whose importance is almost in par with Lord Ayyappa, is located few yards from Sannidhanam. It is believed that the Lord Ayyapan had specific instructions that he wanted Malikappurath Amma, on his left side. Prior to the fire disaster, there was only a Peeda Prathishta (holy seat) at Malikappuram. The idol of Malikappurath Amma was installed by Brahmasree Kandararu Maheswararu Thanthri. The Devi at Malikappuram holds a Sankh, Chakram and Varada Abhya Mudra. Now the idol is covered with a gold Golaka. The temple also was reconstructed in the last decade and now the conical roof and sopanam is covered with gold.[20][unreliable source?]

The Rajarajeswara temple is a Shiva temple located at Taliparamba in the Kannur district of Kerala, South India. The temple is regarded as one of the existing 108 ancient Shiva Temples of ancient Kerala. It also has a prominent place amongst the numerous Shiva temples in South India. It had the tallest shikhara amongst the temples of its time. The Rajarajeshwara temple has a top of about 90 tonnes. If any problem is encountered in the other temples of South India, devotees seek a solution in this temple through a prasna, a traditional method of astrological decision making.The prasna is conducted on a peedha (a raised platform) outside the temple.
Legendarily, it was supposedly renovated by Sage Parashurama, long before the Kali Yuga commenced. Several centuries ago it was renovated by the Mushika (Kolathiri) dynasty kings. This temple was rebuilt into its present form in the early eleventh century. The quadrangular sanctum has a two-tiered pyramidal roof; in front of the sanctum is the namaskara mandapam, but the temple has no kodi maram (flagstaff), unlike others in Kerala. Non-Hindus are not permitted to enter
The quadrangular sanctum has a two tiered pyramidal roof. In front of the sanctum is the namaskara mandapam. The temple has no kodi maram (flagstaff) as opposed to other temples in Kerala. The balikkal has no roof but is embellished by a mysterious figure with a peculiar face. In front of the balikkal is a small rectangular building with a pyramidal roof, which is not usually found anywhere else. An inscription on the structure of the temple tank (which is a little away from the temple on the north side) indicates that the temple and the tank were renovated in 1524 A.D.
Glory of Namaskaramandapa
The Namaskara Mandapa (mukha mandapa) infront of the Sreekovil(sanctum sanctorum) is the place where Lord Sree Rama (on his way back to Ayodhya from Lanka after defeating Ravana) prostrated before Raja Rajeswara. As a respect to Sree Rama no one is allowed into this namaskara mandapa and offer prayers, which is permitted in other temples for Brahmins.
Rulers and Rajarajeswara
In the past, Kerala was divided into many small kingdoms and there were many kings/rulers. They all considered Lord Rajarajeswara as their Chakaravarthy (Rajarajeswara or King of Kings). The Taliparamba region was ruled by Zamorins(Samoothiri) of Kozhikkod(Calicut) and they were devotees of Lord Rajarajeswara. One of the Zamorins was an ardent devotee of the Lord of Taliparamba. After years of intense worship he is said to have entered the sanctum sanctorum and merged with the Lord. Even today, when the elder Zamorin dies, the information should be given to the temple authorities and the Lord is supposed to observe mourning. Even the distant Travancore kings paid obeisance to the deity by offering an elephant whenever a ruler is crowned or visited the temple.
 
The Taliparamba temple also was subject to attack by Tipu Sultan. One finds relics of the old gigantic gopuram at the entrance, which was demolished by Tipu’s army. The story goes that when the temple was under siege, the head priest was inside the sanctum sanctorum and prayed ceaselessly day and night. it is further said that a black snake bit the commander of the army and a hooded serpent appeared before every soldier thus immobilizing the army and saving the temple from total destruction.
 
J.Jayalalitha, the former Chief Minister of Tamilnadu visited Sri Rajarajeshwara Temple at Taliparamba in 2001. Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa offered worship at Rajarajeswara Temple many times and in November 2008, he had offered an elephant. He worshipped Lord Rajarajeswara amid the political crisis faced by his government following the decision by 19 MLAs to withdraw support to the BJP government and he survived from the crisis. But even today none of the ministers of Kerala have the courage to enter the temple of Lord Rajarajeswara.
Koodiyattam
The place is considered as most sacred for performing Koodiyattam and Chakyar Koothu. Whenever a new Koodiyattam is being directed, first it is usually performed at this temple. However only the ‘Maani’ family of Chakyars solely posses the right of performing Koodiyattam here. Legendary Koodiyattam and Chakyar koothu maestro, Natyaachaarya Vidushakaratnam Padma Shri Maani Madhava Chakyaar had performed here for many decades. The title ‘Vidushakaratnam’ was awarded to him from this temple. One of the greatest appreciation or award that an artist/scholar can get, is the ‘Veerashringhala’- Golden Bracelet, from the temple, given by the unanimous approval of the scholar body of the temple. Guru Mani Madhava Chakyaar is the youngest and last person to get the Veerashringhala from here.
The temple at Taliparamba is among the 108 ancient Kerala temples dedicated to Shiva. It is as famous as the Shiva temples in Vaikom, Ettumanur and Trichur.
Taliparamba is regarded as one of the ancient Shakti Peethams. Legend has it that the head of Sati (Goddess/ wife of Shiva) fell here after Shiva’s tandavam following Sati’s self-immolation. Sati was the daughter of Daksh, a respected Hindu king who had a disregard for Shiva.
The Shiva Linga here is believed to be several thousands of years old. Legend has it that Shiva gave three sacred Shiva Lingas to Parvati/Sati for worship.One sage, Maandhata, propitiated Lord Shiva with intense prayers. Shiva was so pleased that he presented one of the Shiva Lingas to him with the injunction that it should be installed only at a place where there was no cremation ground. The sage, after searching all over, found Taliparamba the most sacred spot where he installed the Shiva Linga.
After his death the Linga disappeared into the earth.[4] Then his son Muchukunda offered similar prayers to Shiva and got a second Shiva Linga, which too disappeared in course of time. Centuries passed. The third Shiva Linga was handed down to Satasoman, a king of Mushaka/Kolathiri/Chirakkal Royal Family, who then ruled the region. He was an ardent devotee of Shiva. On the advice of sage Agastya, he prayed to Lord Siva, who granted him the Shiva Linga. The king installed it in the present temple built by him. However, many legends associated with the Temple, claim Agastya Himself as installing the Shiva Linga (which is believed as per those legends to be a ‘Jyothirlingam’).
It is believed that Sri Rama during his victorious return from Lanka stopped here to offer worship to Lord Shiva. In honor of His presence, devotees are not allowed into the namaskara mandapam even today.[4]
Lord Shiva, as worshiped in this sacred temple, is known as Sree Rajarajeswara, which means the Emperor of Emperors — the Lord Supreme. The name signifies the supreme transcendental power in the background of mysterious drama of the boundless universe. That power is invoked here as Lord Rajarajeshwara. Devotees address the lord with such royal appellations as Perumthrikovilappan, Perum-chelloorappan and Thampuraan Perumthrikkovilappan.
The Jyothirlingam in the shrine in vibrant with spiritual power that exerts an enriching influence both on the material and spiritual levels of the earnest devotees. The celebrated ancient sage Agasthya Maharishi is associated with the installation of the Jyothirlingam in the shrine.
The legends of temples are usually symbolic in character and are intended to convey deep messages to the spiritual inquirer and instill faith in the common man. The legends of Sri Rajarajeshwara Temple reveal the antiquity and the special significance of the Spiritual Presence.
A major legend about this temple, begins with the visit of the Puranic sage Parashurama, one of the incarnations of Lord Vishnu. Seeing there, an ancient shrine of vibrant spiritual power in a dilapidated condition, the sage was grief-stricken and wanted to know its history. Thereupon, sage Narada appeared there and related to him the story of the temple. According to it, sage Sanaka and others, the sons of the creator Lord Brahma, churned the disk of the Sun to lessen its fierce heat. They mixed the dust, which was formed while churning, with the divine nectar of immortality, Amrita, and out of it gave shape to three spiritually to Lord Brahma presented them to Goddess Parvathi, the consort of Lord Shiva. Goddess Parvathi presented these Shivalingams to three kings who were doing intense austerities to invoke the Goddess, one in the Thretha Yugam and the other two Dwapara Yugam. Maandhatha was the king to whom the Goddess presented the Shivalingam in the Thretha Yugam, and Muchukundam and Shathasoman were the devotees who received the other two lingams in Dwapara Yugam. Goddess Parvathi advised each of them to install the idols in such a place where no death of any creature had taken place or any dead body had fallen. After a long search for such a place, which was very difficult to locate, Maandhatha, the first one to receive the lingam, found out a small place of that description, only that much land which could accommodate a small plate. Thalika in Malayalam means a plate. It is said that the region came to be known as Taliparamba, which means the place large enough to accommodate a Thalika after this legend. Maandhatha installed his Shivalingam at this place.
Eventually this Jyothirlingam disappeared in the earth rendering the place spiritually vibrant for ever. Thretha Yugam was over. Then, in Dwapara Yugam, King Muchukundan, after receiving the second Jyothirlingam from Goddess Parvathi as instructed, was also in search for a spot where no death had taken place naturally he also came to the same spot where Maandhatha had installed the first Shivalingam. He installed his Shivalingam at the same spot. This Shivalingam was also eventually dissolved into the earth again reinforcing the spot spiritually. Then came king Shathasoman, the one who received the third Shivalingam. He was also naturally attracted to the same spot and installed his Shivalingam there. While installing, this Lingam also began sinking into the earth. King Shathasoman thereupon prayed for Sage Agasthya’s help. The sage appeared and after lighting a ghee lamp prostrated before the Shivalingam twelve times; when he began the thirteenth prostration, the Lingam got firmly fixed on the earth — therefore the number of prostrations the Sage Agasthya performed for his purpose came to be known as twelve and a half. Thus with the installation of the third Shivalingam the sacred spot became spiritually vibrant threefold.
Hearing this story from sage Narada, devotion welled up in the heart of sage Parashurama, and he decided to renovate the temple for the welfare of mankind. As desired by the sage, the celestial architect Ari Vishwakarma performed the renovation work. During the final stage of the renovation, sage Agasthya appeared on the scene and, after making abhishekam (ablution) on the idol, lighted a ghee lamp. This lamp has shone continuously ever since, with a regular supply of ghee. Offering of ghee in gold, silver and copper pitchers with intense devotion, is an important offering for the lord.
Temple legends are highly symbolic representations of the subtle spiritual principles and highlight the nature and intensity of the spiritual presence at a particular place. They instill devotion and convey their deeper message to the spiritual seeker. The above-mentioned legend highlights the fact that at this unique centre of spiritual power discovered and maintained by the great sages of yore, one can receive profound Divine grace for material progress and spiritual un-foldment.

https://www.bharattemples.com/pazhavangadi-ganapathy-temple-thiruvananthapuram-kerala/,"Pazhavangadi Ganapathy Temple, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala
The Pazhavangadi Maha Ganapathy temple(Malayalam: ശ്രീ പഴവങ്ങാടി മഹാ ഗണപതി ക്ഷേത്രം) is situated at East Fort in the heart of Thiruvananthapuram City. The main Deity of the temple is Sri Mahaganapathy (Ganesha). The main idol is installed in a seated posture with the right leg in a folded stance. The temple is situated in close proximity to the Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple. Other Deities worshiped at the temple include Dharmasasta, Goddess Durga and Nagaraja. The temple sculptures include 32 different forms of Lord Ganesha.
The history of temples at Thiruvananthapuram owned by the Madras Regiment and managed by the Madras Regimental Centre is associated with the history of Venad (later Travancore) and its army. The earliest recorded reference on Venad is found in the Madras Museum plates of Parantaka Neduncatain whose period has been ascribed to 765 and 815 A.D. In this period, the royal family of Venad resided at different places resulting in establishing five branches (taavazhis) viz., Venad, Tiruvitaamkod, Trippaappoor, Chiravaayi and Desingnad. Of these, the first three branches assumed responsibilities of ruling the principality. Venad ruler, who also used the title of Chiravaayi Mooppan, was the sovereign authority. Trippappoor (or Keezhperur) Mooppan was considered as the heir-apparent with distinct responsibility to administer the Sree Padmanaabhaswaamy temple in particular and other temples in the principality in general. At that time the jurisdiction of Venad extended over a small tract lying between Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam (Quilon). It, however, got independent status in the beginning of the twelfth century, after the decline of power of the Kulasekhara Empire in Kerala. By the end of thirteenth century, Venad flourished with Kollam (Quilon) as its capital. Towards the beginning of the fifteenth century, the capital of Venad was shifted from Kollam to Tiruvitaamkod (now in Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu). The rulers of Venad continued to have their seat at Tiruvitaamkod till Darapakulangara palace was built at Kalkkulam. The political scene of Venad underwent remarkable changes when Anizham Tirunal Veera Bala Marthaanda Varma assumed as Trippaappoor Mooppan and later when he ascended the throne of Venad in 1729 A.D. (904 M.E.) at the age of 24, following the demise of his uncle Veera Rama Varma. His first major step was suppression of his hostile feudal elements and he carried out the annexation of several principalities on the north of Venad viz. Attingal estate, Desingnad, Elayadatth swaroopam, Kayamkulam, Ambalapuzha, Tekkumkoor, Vatakkumkoor besides small territories belonged to nobles. He thus became the first local Raja whose jurisdiction extended from Kanyakumari in the south to Arookutti in the north. Further he was responsible for the establishment of a centralized administration. Maarthaanda Varma (1729-58 A.D.) rebuilt the Kalkkulam palace in 1744 A.D. and shifted his capital from Tiruvitaamkod to the new place and renamed Kalkkulam as Padmanaabhapuram. From the time of Maarthaanda Varma the unified state is known as Tiruvitaamkoor (or Travancore in later records). After the unification of the state he took a momentous step of Trippati Daaanam (dedication of the kingdom) to his tutelary deity Sree Padmanabhaswaamy of Thiruvananthapuram on 5th Makaram 925 M.E. corresponding to 03 Jan 1750 A.D. Thereafter he and his successors ruled Travancore as Padmanaabha-daasas or servants of Sree Padmanabhaswaamy. By the Trippati Daanam concept the State belonged to the Lord and it helped in the long run to pave political stability in the State.
Consequent to the establishment of a centralized military monarchy, Maarthaanda Varma took initiative to strengthen his armed forces, as by this time Travancore became a great political power to be reckoned with in southwest of India. In 1757, the Travancore Army consisted of 30,000 Nairs (10,000 regular and 20,000 irregular infantry). Due to renewed insurrection within the army in 1809, the whole military force of Travancore was disbanded with the exception of the First Nair Battalion and few mounted troops who were retained for purposes of State and ceremony. A Second Battalion of Nair troops raised the strength of the army during the reign of Raani Gouri Paarvathi Baayi (1815-29) besides forming a new detachment of artillery. Though the Nair battalion continued from 1809 A.D. the designation of the army was changed as Nair Brigade only in 1830 A.D. In 1836 all British troops in Travancore with an exception of one regiment, which was left at Kollam, were withdrawn and the Nair Brigade took over the barracks at the Cantonment (Thiruvananthapuram) occupied previously by the British. They continued there till 1935 when the Nair Brigade was renamed as State Forces and their Station Headquarters shifted to the present site at Pangode. In 1951 the State Forces were integrated with the Indian Army and these forces later formed part of the Madras Regiment. All the officers and jawans who gloriously served the State Forces till 1956 were closely associated with the temples managed by them at Pazhavangadi and at Pangode.
The origin of Sree Maha Ganapathy temple at Pazhavangadi is connected with Padmanabhapuram, the erstwhile capital of Venad. The legend says that being the capital and seat of the Raja, the soldiers had to guard the Padmanabhapuram Palace and the Fort on all sides by sentries. On one of its side is the famous shrine of Yakshi (fierce Spirit Goddess) at Melaankot. Because of the greater fierceness of Yakshi no soldiers dared to take up duty at this point. Whoever had taken night duty was seen lying unconscious on the ground the next day morning. This continued for a long time. On one occasion, the duty of guarding Melaankot fell on to a devotee of Lord Ganapathy. While he was taking bath on the duty-day in the close-by Valliyoor River, his leg touched a stone lying in the river-bed. When he took the same out of the river-bed, he found it to be a very small idol of “Lord Ganapathy”, of about six inches. Feeling the divine grace, he decided to take the idol in his pouch at the time of his duty. As usual Yakshi tried to harm him but Lord Ganapathy guarded him from her blows. Seeing the soldier return harmless the next-day morning other soldiers were very curious and enquired about the reason for his safety. Initially he was reluctant to reveal the reason but on persuasion he divulged the possession of the idol and its immaculate powers. As the idol was shown to the sentry by the Lord Himself, other soldiers in the barracks of Padmanabhapuram took initiative (around 1750 A.D.) to worship the same within the barracks before commencing their official daily-routines. From that day onwards “Lord Ganapathy” became a war-God of the Nair Brigade. As the idol was obtained by the will and blessings of the Lord from a river-bed, the idol is considered as self-revealed, one of Lord (swayambhoo) and soldiers were bestowed with the responsibility of preserving the idol at all cost without causing any damage to it for ever. They continued to worship this idol at Padmanabhapuram till it was shifted to Thiruvanathapuram, during the reign (1758-1798 A.D.) of Sree Kaarttika Tirunal Maharaja, popularly known as Dharma Raja. In this context, it has to be mentioned that Sree Padmanabhaswaamy temple possesses, perhaps, the largest and most fabulous hoard of palmyrah-leaf records ever discovered in Kerala, dating back to 550 Malayalam (Kollam) era (1375 A.D.). These records are popularly known as Mathilakam records and is written in ola (palmyrah leafs) and kept in churunas (scrolls). In churuna 11 ola 150 it has been stated in one of such records that silver throne of Maharajah was brought from Padmanabhapuram for his use in 935 ME/1760 A.D, which indicates the year of shifting of capital to Thiruvananthapuram in 1760 A.D. In another such record (Volume 13, Churuna 1282 of 946 M. E / 1771 A.D.) it has been stated that “to be free from the obstacle of rain during the ezhunellatt (procession of Maharaja) towards east 300 coconuts have been broken at the Pazhavangadi Ganapati temple.” This record throws light that the temple was in existence at Pazhavangati earlier than 1771 A.D.
When the capital of Travancore was shifted in 1760 A.D. from Padmanabhapuram to Thiruvananthapuram, major portion of the army was also moved to Thiruvananthapuram. The idol of Lord Ganapathy was also taken to Thiruvananthapuram and for sometime kept under a peepul tree of Sree Pazhaya Sreekanteswaram temple. Then with the generous help of Dharma Raja a small shrine was built in the Magazine Area, located in the Fort Area (present Pazhavangadi) around 1765 A.D. Renovations were carried out in later years particularly during the period of Aayilyam Thirunaal Raama Varma Maharaja (1860-80). Subsequently two minor deities were installed viz, Goddess Durga Bhagavati (symbolizing sarva-sakti-swaroopani or as an embodiment of all energies) and Lord Vettakkorumakan (younger son of Lord Siva in Goddess Paarvati and is considered as war-God with churika (dagger) in hand). Thus all deities in this temple are ideal and best suited for welfare of soldiers and success in warfare. The exact dates of installation of these idols are not known. A Bhajana-mandapam was opened on September 9, 1983. Laying the foundation stone of the imposing Mandapam with gopuram on the eastern side of the temple was done on 31st December 1993 and it was declared open on March 25, 1996. Major renovations were also carried out in 1996. A Reference Library with rare collections of religious books in Sanskrit, English and other languages was formally opened at the top floor of the Bhajana-mandapam on March 9, 2003 The work of providing Lift service to the Library for the use of public, especially for the use of senior citizens started on June 23, 2006 but it became fully operative only in April 2009. Three sides of sub-shrines of Lord Vettakkorumakan and Goddess Durga Bhagavati were covered with decorated brass sheets for safety and for ambience in August 2009.
The temple is located 0.5 km from the Thiruvananthapuram Central railway station and the central bus station. The nearest city bus stand is at East Fort.
Thiruvananthapuram International Airport is about 8 kilometers away from the temple.

https://www.bharattemples.com/padmanabhaswamy-temple-thiruvananthapuram-kerala/,"Padmanabhaswamy Temple, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala
Padmanabhaswamy Temple is located in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India. The temple is built in an intricate fusion of the indigenous Kerala style and the Tamil style (kovil) of architecture associated with the temples located in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu, featuring high walls, and a 16th-century Gopuram.While the Moolasthanam of the temple is the Ananthapuram Temple in Kumbala in Kasargod District, architecturally to some extent, the temple is a replica of the Adikesava Perumal templelocated in Thiruvattar, Kanyakumari District.
The principal deity Vishnu is enshrined in the “Anantha Shayanam” posture, the eternal yogic sleep on the serpent Adisheshan.Sree Padmanabhaswamy is the tutelary deity of the royal family of Travancore. The titular Maharaja of Travancore Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma is the trustee of the temple. In line with the Temple Entry Proclamation, only those who profess the Hindu faith are permitted entry to the temple and devotees have to strictly follow the dress code.The name of the city of Thiruvananthapuram in Malayalam translates to “The City of Lord Ananta”, referring to the deity of Padmanabhaswamy Temple.
 
In the sanctum sanctorum, Padmanabha reclines on the serpent Anantha or Adi Sesha.[19] The serpent has five hoods facing inwards, signifying contemplation. The Lord’s right hand is placed over a Shiva lingam. Sridevi-Lakshmi, the Goddess of Prosperity and Bhudevi the Goddess of Earth, two consorts of Vishnu are by his side. Brahma emerges on a lotus, which emanates from the navel of the Lord. The deity is made from 12,008 saligramams.[20] These saligrams are from the banks of the Gandaki River in Nepal, and to commemorate this certain rituals used to be performed at the Pashupatinath Temple.The deity of Padmanabha is covered with, “Katusarkara yogam”, a special ayurvedic mix, which forms a plaster that keeps the deity clean. The daily worship is with flowers and for the abhishekam, special deities are used.The platforms in front of the vimanam and where the deity rests are both carved out of a single massive stone and hence called “Ottakkal-mandapam”. On the orders of Marthanda Varma (1706–58), the Ottakkal-mandapam was cut out of a rock at Thirumala, about 4 miles (6.4 km) north of the temple. It measured 20 square feet (1.9 m2; 190 dm2; 19,000 cm2) in area by 2.5 feet (30 in; 7.6 dm; 76 cm) thick and was placed in front of the deity in the month of Edavom 906 M.E. (1731 CE). At the same time, Marthanda Varma also brought 12,000 shaligrams, aniconic representations of Vishnu, from the Gandaki River, north of Benares (now known as Varanasi) to the temple. These were used in the reconsecration of the Padmanabha.
n order to perform darshan and puja, one has to ascend to the mandapam. The Deity is visible through three doors – the visage of the reclining Lord and Siva Linga underneath the hand is seen through the first door; Sridevi and Bhrigu Muni in Katusarkara, Brahma seated on a lotus emanating from the Lord’s navel, hence the name, “Padmanabha”, gold abhisheka moorthies of Lord Padmanabha, Sridevi and Bhudevi, and silver utsava moorthi of Padmanabha through the second door; the Lord’s feet, and Bhudevi and Markandeya Muni in Katusarkara through the third door. The idols of two goddesses holding chamaram, Garuda, Narada, Tumburu, the divine forms of the six weapons of Lord Vishnu, Surya, Chandra, Saptarshi(Seven Sages), Madhu, and Kaitabha are also there in the Sanctum. Only the King of Travancore may perform sashtanga namaskaram, or prostrate on the “Ottakkal Mandapam”. It is traditionally held that anybody who prostrates on the mandapam has surrendered all that he possesses to the Deity. Since the ruler has already done that, he is permitted to prostrate on this mandapam.
Several extant Hindu Texts like the Brahma Purana, Matsya Purana, Varaha Purana, Skanda Purana, Padma Purana, Vayu Purana, Bhagavata Purana and the Mahabharata mention this shrine. The Temple has been referred to in the (only recorded) Sangam Period of literature between 500 B.C and 300 A.D several times.Many conventional historians and scholars are of the opinion that one of the names that the Temple had – “The Golden Temple” – literally was in cognizance of the fact that the Temple was already unimaginably wealthy by that point.Many extant pieces of Sangam Tamil literature and poetry, and even the later works of Ninth Century Tamil poet-saints like Nammalwar, refer to the Temple and even the city as having walls of pure gold. At some places, both the Temple and the entire city are often eulogized even as being made of gold, and the Temple as Heaven.[12][13]
The temple is one of the 108 principal Divya Desams (“Holy Abodes”) in Vaishnavism, and is glorified in the Divya Prabandha.[citation needed] The Divya Prabandha glorifies this shrine as being among the 13 Divya Desam in Malai Nadu (corresponding to present-day Kerala and some adjoining areas).The 8th century Tamil poet Alvar Nammalvar sang the glories of Padmanabha.The Ananthapuram Temple in Kasargod is believed to be the ‘Moolasthanam’ of the Temple.
The sage Vilvamangalathu Swamiyar, who resided near Ananthapuram Temple in Kasargod District, prayed to Lord Vishnu for his darshan or “auspicious sight”. The Lord is believed to have come in the guise of a little boy who was mischievous. The boy defiled the Idol which was kept for Puja. The sage became enraged at this and chased away the boy, who disappeared. After a long search, when he was walking on the banks of Arabian Sea, he heard a pulaya lady threatening her child that she would throw him in Ananthankadu. The moment the Swami heard the word Ananthankadu he was delighted. He proceeded to Ananthankadu based on the directions of the lady of whom he enquired. The Sage reached Ananthankadu searching for the boy. There he saw the boy merging into an Iluppa tree (Indian Butter Tree). The tree fell down and became Anantha Sayana Moorti (Vishnu reclining on the celestial snake Anantha). But the edifice that the Lord assumed was of an extraordinarily large size, with His head at Thiruvallom, navel at Thiruvananthapuram, and lotus-feet at Thrippadapuram (Thrippappur), making him some eight miles in length. The Sage requested the Lord to shrink to a smaller proportion that would be thrice the length of his staff. Immediately the Lord shrank to the form of the Idol that is seen at present in the Temple. But even then many Iluppa trees obstructed a complete vision of the Lord. The Sage saw the Lord in three parts – thirumukham, thiruvudal and thrippadam. Swami prayed to Padmanabha to be forgiven. The Swami offered Rice Kanji and Uppumanga (salted mango pieces) in a coconut shell to the Perumal which he obtained from the pulaya woman. The spot where the Sage had darsan of the Lord belonged to Koopakkara Potti and Karuva Potti. With the assistance of the reigning King and some Brahmin households a Temple was constructed. Koopakkara Potti was made the Tantri of the Temple.The Ananthankadu Nagaraja Temple still exists to the north west of the Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The Samadhi (final resting place) of the Swamiyar exists to the west of the Padmanabha Temple. A Krishna Temple was built over the Samadhi. This Temple, known as Vilvamangalam Sri Krishna Swami Temple, belongs to Thrissur Naduvil Madhom

Located in Peruvanam, Thrissur, the Peruvanam Mahadeva Temple is one of the most famous temples dedicated to Lord Shiva. The opulent temple comprises of two shrines namely ‘Irattayappan Temple’ on the North and ‘Maadathilappan Temple’ on the South of the main temple which is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The dual Shivalinga is the unique feature of the Irattayappan Temple which is the reason why its prime deity is also known as Irattayappan denoting the duality. Madathilappan Temple’s sanctum is considered to be the tallest one in South India. One of the most famous festivals which are celebrated in the temple is the Peruvanam Pooram. The Archaeological Survey of India has been protecting the temple since 1982.
The temple which sprawls over 7 acres of land and is surrounded by a compound wall follows the Kerala style of architecture. The sanctum sanctorum follows a square structure which is rarely seen in Indian temples. Also, the inner courtyard can be reached from two sides, i.e. east and west while the main entrance lies on the east. The Irattayappan shrine has been built on a circular base. Also, the Matatthilappan Temple is situated on the south and consists of three stories. Being one of the most prominent temple structures in Kerala, it should be given a visit. One is likely to get awestruck by the beauty of the temple and the peace that the surroundings provide.
Legend has it that the Saint Parashurama established 64 Gramams or sections after reclaiming Keralam from sea and Peruvanam Gramam is the 1st and most important among them. It is said that the temple was created by ‘Pooru Maharshi’, the son of the Hasthinapura King Yayathy after propitiating the Load Shiva with rigorous penance and the name of the place derived from the word “POORU VANAM”. Further it is believed that while transporting a beautiful, big Shivalinga received from a lake near Badarinath to this place, it happened to stuck in the branch of a tree and the present Madathilappan Temple has been constructed at this place. Shiva in dual linga form is the main feature of the temple and Lord is called “IRATTAYAPPAN” which denote the duality. The Sricovil of Madathilappan is considered to be the tallest Sricovil in South India. Four Sastha temples at Akmala, Kuthiran, Edathiruthy and Oozath are located on the boundaries of Peruvanam Gramam and Thiruvullakkavu Sastha Temple is located at the centre of the Gramam. Irattayappan is the ‘Gramadhipathi’ and Thiruvullakkavu Sastha is considered the ‘Gramaraskhakan’. Now the temple is under the joint administration of Cochin Devaswom Board and TravancoreDevaswom Board. There is a vast area of land and an office called ‘Cherikalam’ are existed near the south ‘Gopuram’ of this temple. It is important and rare that the Maharaja of Travancore had interest in this temple and therefore, the expenses for ‘Utcha Pooja’, ‘Prodhosha Nivedhyam’, ‘Nira Puthiri’, ‘Koothu’ are borne by him.  It still continues.
The Peruvanam Mahadeva Temple is situated at a distance of 10 kilometres from the Thrissur railway station which takes about 12-15 minutes to cover by car. You can hire a taxi to reach the temple.

https://www.bharattemples.com/oachira-temple-kollam-kerala/,"Oachira Temple, kollam, kerala
Oachira Temple is an ancient temple located in Oachira in Kollam district in the South Indian state of Kerala. According to the Puranas, this temple is one of the famous sacred places of Kerala and India.[2] Oachira is on the border of Kollam and Allappuzhadistricts, next to the National Highway 47.[3] This temple is known “DakshinaKashi”(SouthaKashi).This very ancient pilgrimage center is centered on the ParaBrahma temple (that is dedicated to the Para Brahman (or Param Brahman) or shiva or Ohmkaram, the Universal Consciousness), and covers thirty-six acres of land.
Every year the Oachira Vrischikam Festival is celebrated during December and January. Oachirakkali is a famous ritual performed here during June and it involves mock-fighting in muddy water by traditional martial art experts. And “Irupathattam onam” (28 days after Onam) is also celebrated. It is the festival of cattle. In this festival, huge “Eduppu kala” (gigantic idols of bull madeof cloth&hay) are made. They are then pulled on giant wheels to the Oachira Temple from the site where they are made. Normally there are around 50 such structures. It is the biggest festival in “Onattu Kara” which is an area of a few square miles. Oachirakkali was actually a war exercise performed annually by soldiers of Kayamkulam Raja. Nearby, about 108 Kalaries were in 52 karas up to the beginning of the 20th century. Soldiers belonging to the above Karas met together at Oachira in the Malayalam month of Mithuna every year and performed war-like exercises. This is what is called Oachirakkali. During the years of the Kayamkulam Rajah, Oachirakkali was started after the blessings of nearby Nambiathiris, high order Nambudiri Brahmins, having the knowledge of Dhanurveda (the science of arms) who were also experts in Smrithy Sasthras.
Ward and Conner, two British officials entrusted to survey Travancore in the beginning of the 19th century, made their observations about Oachira in their report. In the report it was made clear that there was a very old and damaged pagoda on the eastern side of the Padanilam. It was also disclosed that there was a large reservoir at the center of the vast ground on which the temple stands, (which was now known as Kallukettuchira), and which is outside the temple compound today.
There are many beliefs as to why this place is called Oachira. Some people believe that the place name came from the word Omkarachira and some others believe that the name is originated from the name Oymanchira. Also there are strong beliefs that the name derived from Uvachanchira as Uvachan means Lord Siva as per belief. All these assumptions are based on myths.
The real reason for arriving at the name of Oachira is possibly different. For that, we should understand the observations made by the two British officials, Ward and Conner, who conducted a survey in the erstwhile Travancore during the beginning of the 19th century. In their survey report, it was mentioned that there was a large reservoir at the center of the large ground called Padanilam. This reservoir (tank/pond/chira) was at the center of the Padanilam. This chira was used by the soldiers in olden days for bathing and for supplying water to the horses used in the war exercises. This chira might have been known in olden days as Onattuchira, as the place belonged to the Kayamkulam Raja who was also called the Odanattu Raja or simply Onattu Rajah. The Headquarters of Kayamkulam Raja was at that time at Krishnapuram, very near to the Padanilam (which is hardly 1 km away from Oachira). So it is believed that the word Onattuchira was gradually accepted as the place name and as time passed by further, that word was corrupted into Oachira. This is quite a plausible explanation as there are so many examples in known history about the transformation of place names.
The Oachira Temple is unique in the sense that it does not have covered structures for temples. People worship the Para Brahma (the original formless power lord shiva) under neatly preserved trees.

https://www.bharattemples.com/muthappan-temple-kannur-kerala/,"Muthappan Temple, kannur, kerala
Parassinikadavu Muthappan temple is a temple, located at Anthoor Municipality on the banks of the Valapattanam river about 10 km from Taliparamba and 16 km from Kannur City in Kannur District, Kerala.Principal deity of the temple is Sree Muthappan, whose divinity is presented as a ritualistic theyyam enactment in two versions called Thiruvappana and Vellattam. According to the local tradition the presiding deity is a manifestation of Shiva.
Vellattam and Thiruvappana are the generic names for two types of ‘ Theyyam Ketti-aadal ‘ in the kavu/temples of North Malabar.
Vellattom is a minor version of the ritual enactment where the ornaments, decorations and parapharnelia are minimal thanks to which all actions including vaaythari (speech) is maximum and Attam (dance) will be at its peak. If you compare this level of enactment to the idol of a deity in a temple sanctum which is installed as per sathwic sasthra and vedic rituals, Vellattom is at par with the idol alone without the prabha-mandalam which circles it. A more easier example is the Seeveli ceremony with only the small idol on top of the elephant.
On the other hand, Thiruvappana is the full version, with royal regalia and bigger dimension of prabhamandalam. Because the decorations are more and are of binding nature, the action is minimal and sluggish and the uriyaadal (replies to prayers) will be crisp, to the point and predictions will be accurate. To compare, Thiruvappana stands at par with temple idol with the Prabha-mandalam (representing the auric circle) around it and the Seeveli with the big Swarna-Kolam covering the small idol on top of the elephant .
Muthappan is considered as the manifestation of Lord Shiva himself in Nayattu (hunter) format. The Vellattam which comes initially is Siva himself as the said minimal version. But the Vellattom which comes along with the grand Thiruvappana of Muthappan later on, is the minimal version of Vishnu who according to mythology, comes to Siva’s assistance when he started travelling with the poykannu (blindfold) and started suffering serious difficulties to travel and hunt for food.
Rituals of the temple is unique in that it does not follow the Satvic Brahminical form of worship, as in other Hindu temples of Kerala. The main mode of worship is the ritual enactment of both the versions of Muthappan, through a traditional dance known as Muthappan Theyyam.Fish, meat and toddy are the customary offerings to Muthappan.Muthappan Thiruvoppana Mahothsavam is the major festival of the temple, celebrated for three days every year on 19, 20 and 21 of Kumbham
 
A version of the legend of Ponnu Muthappan is narrated here: The King of Ancharamana in Eruvessi village and his wife, Padikutty Antharjanam, had no offsprings. Padikutty was an ardent devotee of Shiva and when she found a baby floating in a basket of flowers in the river water when she was coming back after a bath in the river, she took it as the blessing of Lord Shiva, and so was her husband. The child grew up and in his boyhood, he was always for the benefit of downtrodden and poor people. However, to the agony of his family he practiced hunting, and also started eating flesh, which was not allowed for a Naduvazhi. Unable to bear the indictments from his family, the boy decided to leave home. When his mother attempted to stop him, he looked at her in fury and appeared in his original godly figure before the parent. She bowed down before her son. Nonetheless, she requested him to cover his eyes with a Poikannu, a type of shield for the eyes, since she was afraid that such a fiery look on another occasion may cause to emanate the cosmic force, Shakti, that could change the entire world. Wearing a shield on his eyes, he left the family, and passed through various villages in Malabar, such as Kunnathurpadi, Puralimala, Padavil, Thillenkeri, Kannapuram, Parassinikadavu and Valluvankadav.[5][7]
The legend relates Muthappan with a tribal family for the divine boy started being called as “Muthappan”. Accordingly, when he reached a village called Kunnathurpadi, he got a tribalman, Chantan as his friend. One day, when he saw Chantan tapping toddy from Palm tree the boy asked for it but was denied. All of sudden, Chantan was cursed and became a stone. His wife prayed and offered to perform the rituals, Oottu, Tiruvappana and Amruthakalasam, to propitiate the boy in the month of Dhanu. The boy relented and gave her husband back. The Chantan family started to conduct pooja to propitiate the boy and they called him in the name: “Muthappan”.
However, according to another version of the legend Muthappan climbed the coconut tree and emptied the toddy jar in the absence of Chantan. When Chantan returned and saw Muthappan holding the jar, he was provoked and defied the latter. It was at this instant, Chantan was cursed.[7]
The legend also describes a dog which always followed Muthappan throughout his journey. Hence, in the temple of Muthappan, dogs are considered divine and the temple entrance has an idol of dog, at both sides.

https://www.bharattemples.com/mannarasala-temple-alappuzha-kerala/,"Mannarasala Temple, Alappuzha, kerala
Mannarasala Sree Nagaraja Temple(Malayalam: മണണാറശ്ശാല ശ്രീ നാഗരാജാക്ഷേത്രം) is a very ancient and internationally known centre of pilgrimage for the devotees of serpent gods (Nagaraja). The famous Nagaraja temple “Mannarasala” is nestled in a forest glade, like most snake temples. The Mannarasala Temple has over 30,000 images of snakes along the paths and among the trees, and is the largest such temple in Kerala. Women seeking fertility come to worship here, and upon the birth of their child come to hold thanksgiving ceremonies here, often bringing new snake images as offerings.A special turmeric paste which is available at the temple is credited with curative powers.
Though the legends related to the origin of a place cannot be deemed as its history, the story on the evolution of Mannarasala as one of the foremost places of worship of the Serpent Gods is associated with Lord Parashurama who is widely believed to be the creator of Kerala. This history of Mannarasala has been mentioned in the ‘Mandara Salodyam’, a Sanskrit poem written by Mannarasala M.G. Narayanan Namboodiri of the sacred family based on the accounts and legends handed down and old scriptures and books available with the temple.
Lord Parashurama in order to release himself from the sin of killing Kshatriyas approached the holy Rishis. They suggested that he should make a gift of a land of his own to the Brahmins. Parashurama, the son of jamadagni , propitiated Varuna to get some land for himself. He threw into sea the axe which Lord Shiva had given him with his blessings. Thus he reclaimed the land from the sea and gave it as a gift to the Brahmins according to the rites. This land came to be known as Kerala. This piece of land, however was not habitable because of the salinity of the soil and as a result people began to leave the place. Another reason for the Brahmins leaving the land was because Kerala, full of forests, was heavily infested with extremely poisonous snakes. To get protection from the snakes Snake worship was initiated. Bharghavarama was pained at this. He undertook a penance to please Lord Shiva, who advised him that the objective could be realized only if the flaming poison of the serpents was spread into the soil and that the only means of doing that was the worship of Nagaraja. Parashurama set out with his disciples in search of a deserted jungle in order to please Nagaraja. He found a suitable place near the seashore in the southern part of Kerala. Satisfied with having found a proper place for the realization of his cherished dream, the great Rishi constructed a Theerthasthala for the performance of the penance.
A pleased Nagaraja, appeared before Parashurama, willing to grant him his desire. According to the poem by Mannarasala M.G.Narayanan Namboodiri, the Nagaraja made his appearance as if : ” The unspeakable splendor of millions of moons! The bright magnificence of emeralds stuck to the hoods. Golden jewels made attractive by miraculous embroidery! Lotus feet worshiped by crowds of Gods! Brilliant beauty of form, full of youthfulness!”.
Parasurama prostrated at the lotus feet of Nagaraja and prayed to realize his objective. Nagaraja granted his request with great pleasure. Ferocious serpents arrived at the spot at once to spread the flaming Kalakuda poison. Because of the percolation of poison, the land of Kerala was desalinated, to become habitable with envious greenery. Parasurama then requested the Lord to bless the land forever with his eternal presence which was also accepted by the kindly-disposed Nagaraja.
Parashurama installed, according to Vedic rites, Nagaraja, who is Brahma, Vishnu and Siva in one in the ‘Thirthasthala’ (Hall of pilgrimage) filled with Mandara trees, the place now known as Mannarasala. (The installed deity here represents Anantha (Vishnuswaroopa) and Vasuki (Siva in spirit). The installations of Sarpayakshi, Nagayakshi and Nagachamundi, the Naga deities, as well as of their associates were conducted in the proper places with the proper rituals. Parashurama performed to the accompaniment of Vedic recitation and singing of Sama, Abhishekam, Alankaram, Neivedyasamarpanam, Neeranjanam, Sarpabali and other rites pleasing to the serpents and thereby made all the serpents happy. installed Durga and other deities in different places; appointed Brahmins who were Tantric experts for performing poojas; nominated Kshathriyas, peasants and the Ashtavaidyas who were supreme among the physicians; thus he brought Kerala, filled with beautiful vegetation and to prosperity.
After giving important instructions to be followed to preserve the sanctity of the place, Parashurama proceeded to the Mahendra Mountains to continue his austerities.
Many generations passed by. The family fell into the grief of childlessness. Vasudeva and Sreedevi were the sad couple who had to bear that heavy load of sorrow, who resolutely worshiped Nagaraja to allay their grief. It was about this time that unexpectedly fire broke out in the jungle around the dwelling place of Nagaraja and burnt down the jungle. The serpents were tortured by the flames, forcing them to hide in their pits with great difficulty. Vasudeva and Sreedevi looked after the serpents, who had their hoods charred, bodies half-burnt, and fainting from time to time, falling down and crawling along. They gently fanned them with fans made of sweet-scented grass and poured ghee mixed with honey and oil on the wounds; cooled their melted bodies with sandalwood ointment; and comforted them. They put them at the foot of banyan trees. They performed purification ceremonies and consecrated the pits; and were put up in special places under the shade of deodar trees and in Chitrakudas. The couple performed abhisheka with theertha like Panchagavya (a holy mixture of five items from the cow’s milk, curd, butter, urine and dung); observed elaborate poojas according to rules with areca nut flower bunches, fragrant flowers and water, incense etc., Nivedyam with melted butter (ghee), milk, payasam with molasses, rice powder, turmeric powder, coconut juice, Kadali fruit, cow’s milk, all mixed together in the proper form as Nurum Palum, equivalent to the elixir of life. They offered serpent deities with great devotion, appam, aval (beaten rice or rice wafers), tender coconut etc. They chanted vedic mantras, performed homams and all kinds of poojas to restore those crowds of serpents to full health.
The omnipresent and omnipotent Nagaraja was greatly pleased with their continuous penance and the love shown to his associates; Nagaraja made himself visible to the couple and blessed them that he would incarnate on the earth as their beloved son. He said ” I shall assume the form of a serpent and stay here (in Mannarasala) permanently, as long as the sun and the moon are there, showering prosperity on your family and granting protection to all the devotees who come here …”. Thus Mandarasala, the place filled with Mandara trees, the holy spot where the serpents got shelter, where the earth was fully cooled, became Mandarasala. The boon came true. The Brahmin lady became pregnant and gave birth to five-hooded serpent-child as well as a human child. The two brothers grew up together. Initiation ceremonies and Vedic education were carried out at the proper time in the traditional style. Nagaraja instructed the younger brother to enter into matrimony for the perpetual reservation of the holy family and he obeyed it. When the five-hooded Nagaraja realized that the objectives of his incarnation were realized, he informed the Holy Mother that henceforth he would live at this Illam by entering into Samadhi to bless the devotees. Then he suggested certain inviolable rituals and rules for offering worship and then went into the immaculate cellar and vanished. (It is believed that even today that five-hooded Nagaraja stays in the cellar doing Tapas for the abound prosperity of his dependents. The members of the household always refer to him with great respect and devotion as “Muthassan’ and “Appoppan” (Grand father). The jungle close by is the exclusive preserve for his unobstructed peregrinations (Appoppan Kavu – Grandfathers’ Grove).

Te nearest airport is Calicut airport which is 87 km away.
Pooram is the important festival here and it is conducted with great pomp and show. The week-long festival begins with Kodiyettam (flag hoisting) and concludes with Arattu. The temple dedicated to goddess Durga has great historical importance as Thacholi Othenan, the legendary martial hero of Kerala, used to worship here every day.
Lokanarkavu and Kalarippayattu Thirty days Mandala Utsavam in Malayalam month Vrischikam (November-December) and pooram in Malayalam month meenam (March-April) are the annual festival at the Lokanarkavu Bhagavathy Temple. This is the only temple where a peculiar folk dance called Poorakkali is presented during festivals. The dance, resembles the martial art Kalarippayattu. Even today, all Kalaripayattu artists seek the blessings of the deity before their debut due to the association of Lokanarkavu Temple with legendary hero thacholi othenan.
Lokanarkavu Temple Festivals Two annual festivals are celebrated here during the Malayalam months of Vrischikam (November – December) and Meenam (March – April).
Lokanarkavu Utsavam This main festival of the temple, which lasts for 41 days, is held during the Malayalam month of Vrischikam (mid November to mid December). It is locally known as Mandalavilakku Festival or Mandala Utsavam. The unique feature of the festival is that it is only here a folk dance called Thacholikali is performed during the temple festival. Thacholikali is similar to the traditional martial art form called Kalarippayattu.
Large numbers of people from various places flock here to see this festival. Another attraction is that all the lamps on the walls of the Lokanarkavu Bhaghawathi Temple are lit on the occasion.
This temple of godess Durga stands 4kilometers from vatakara,near calicut a noted town in kerala,india.The temple is a complex of three temples of godess Durga,Shiva and VIshnu. The temple is frequently referred in the ballads of north kerala as the legendery hero Thacholi Othenan was a devotee of this godess.
The Durga temple was built by Aryans Vaishya Brahmins who migrated to this place some 1500 years back. They were Brahmins who took up trade as their main occupation. The Aryan successors of these temple still are of prime importance in the temple. They gradually began to accept some of the traditions of local Nairs and made martial relationship with them. But on close examination their customs and beliefs are evidently different from local Nair community. It is believed that the godess travelled with them to Lokanarkavu in the form of a lady who followed the five hundred Aryans. The successors still see this godess as their mother and not as godess. Often the name of Thacholi Othenan is misquoted with the origin of temple. Othenan was a great devotee,but never had any holding rights or anything to do with the establishment of Durga temple. It is evident from the fact that the godess is Durga at Lokanarkavu and not the Kali form. The heroes of Vadakkan Pattukal had their ancestral godesses as Kali form and not Durga form. The same applies to the local rulers who later claimed Lokanarkavu as their family godess.
All the rulers of Kerala had Godesses with Thamasa pooja or shakteya pooja; ie poojas in which either man or animal was sacrificed. It was a more local tradition and most family temples of Kerala kings and locals had followed such tradition untill it was modified. Later due to Aryanisation of temples, modifications were made by replacing human sacrifice with cutting plantain or performing poojas with tender coconut and cereals meant to replace liquor and meat. Unlike this local tradition Lokanarkavu durga temple do not have any such traditions and never had such practises as it was established by Aryans itself. It is said that most other godess temples in kerala are in Madhyama and rarely in Uthama state.
But this temple is said to be in Athyuthama state. The Aryans though manifested as locals they strongly upheld their ehical roots through a complex of differences from rest of the people. The race spirit was so high at older times that it is said that they refused to pay taxes to the local kings of kerala,as none of them was an Aryan. But at the same time or say at a later period they began to ignore the cast restrictions and even seemed to threaten the cast equations. But slowly they became adjusted and more reclusive and settles around the temple areas and withdrew from all other matters of Local people. Among the mandala vilakku festival, the successors of these Aryan Vaishya Brahmins migrants conduct the 16th vilakku, thats on 16th day and is of prime importance. As we enter the temple we must pray to the stage kept in memory of these Aryan Brahmin Ancestors who built the temple. The stage is at right side to the main entrance and all devottees must seek their permission and pray to them to see the godess inside. This is to show that the Lokanarkavu Durga holds these people to the highest esteem and she had followed them whereever they went and their happiness is her prime importance. It is said that the prayers done without praying to these ancestors goes much unheard. In short it is a place of a never experienced tradition in Kerala.Thirty days Mandala Utsavam in Malayalam month Vrischikam (November–December) and pooram in Malayalam month meenam (March–April) are the annual festival at the Lokanarkavu Bhagavathy Temple. This is the only temple where a peculiar folk dance called Poorakkali is presented during festivals. The dance, resembles the martial art Kalarippayattu.

The temple comprises the main structure, walled compound with citadels, four ponds around the main structure where in one of the ponds is situated within the walled structure. Koodalmanikyam Temple is the only ancient temple in India dedicated to the worship of Bharata, the third brother of Rama, however the idol is that of Vishnu. “Sangameshwara”(Lord of the Confluence) is another name associated with the deity at Koodalmanikyam. The temple is one of four in Kerala state that form a set called “Nalambalam”,each temple dedicated to one of the four brothers in Ramayana: Rama, Bharata, Lakshmana and Shatrughna.
The Thachudaya Kaimal as “Manikkam Keralar” is the spiritual chief and the temporal ruler of the Koodalmanikyam Temple and its Estates. The line goes back to antiquity and is mentioned in the Skanda Purana. The temporal rights over the ancient temple, that is the office of the Kaimal (as opposed to “Manikkam Keralar”) and the office of “Melkoyma”.
 
The earliest historical reference to Koodalmanikyam Temple is found on a stone inscription attributed to the Chera king Stanu Ravi Varman dated 854 A.D, donating vast extents of land for the temple. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that the temple must have been in existence for quite some time before this date and that even then Koodalmanikyam occupied a place of importance among temples of Kerala.
Koodalmanikyam temple plays a key role in the history of Irinjalakuda as most land in and around the region belonged to the Koodalmanikyam Temple and the Thachudaya Kaimals of Travancore until 1971.The temple attracts devotees and tourists, a source of revenue for the Government.

The shrine on the east bank (Kizhakkeshwaram or Akkare Kottiyoor) is a temporaryhermitage (Yaga shrine) opened only during the Vysakha festival. The Vadakkeshwaram or Ikkare Kottiyoor (The Thruchherumana Temple) on the western bank of the river is a permanent temple complex like all other temples. It remains closed throughout the year except for the 27 days of Vysakha festival. The temple is situated in a densely forested area amidst a sacred grove that covers about 80 acres. Mythology says that Akkare Kottiyoor, the shrine on the eastern bank of the river, was the location of Daksha Yaga, at the conclusion of which, Sati Deviimmolated herself and thus committed suicide in this place.
The Thruchherumana Temple was built after the Swayambhoo lingam was found; however the exact date of construction of temple is not known, the pilgrimage has been taking place for many centuries
The Puffed rice(Pori or Malaru) is prepared at “Pullancheri Illam”, and handed over to the temple from Narasimhaswamy temple, Pala, near Muzhakunnu Kottiyoor Temple is also closely associated with the Tirunelli MahaVishnu Temple in Wayanad District, about 54 km from Kotttiyoor It was from Tirunelli that rice was given to Kottiyoor for Vysakha Mahotsavam and returned after the festival. This has been discontinued but rites are performed in both temples to continue the tradition.It is believed that Bhuta Ganas carry the presents of Tirunelli Perumal to Vysakha Mahotsavam. Once a Bhuta tried to steal a present and the Perumal cursed him to become a rock.The Sacred sword of Veerabhadra is brought for the Kottiyoor Festival from “Mutherikavu” a nearby temple.
Tons of fire woods are used for the Kottiyoor festival in the shrine. Not even for a single year until now has it been required to remove the excess ash from the altar. All the essentials needed for Ammarakkal Tara is brought from Manathana shrine. Sacred swords also come from Chapparam Bhagavathi temple. Pooja vessals, ornaments etc., come from Karimbanagopuram.
Kottiyoor or Kottiyur is an ancient Hindu pilgrim center devoted to Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati in Kannur district, Kerala. The temple is situated on the beautiful Sahya mountain range valley and is blessed with abundant natural beauty. The Bavali river with her medicinal waters flow from the Wayanad ghats on the banks of the temple. On the northern side of the river bank, there is a small lake known as ‘Thiruvanchira’ and here in the midst of this lake is this temple sans temple.
The temple has a Shiva linga believed to be a ‘swayambhu’. Swayambhu means born on his own or not man made. The small heap where this Shiva linga is worshipped is known as ‘Manithara’. The abhishekam for the Shiva linga is with milk, ghee (clarified butter) and karikku (tender coconut water). In the same lake, there is another heap ‘Ammarakallu’ where Sree Parvati Devi is worshipped. This way, at Kottiyoor you get the blessings of both Shiva and Shakthi.
Kottiyoor is also known by the names Kudiyoor, Dakshina Kashi. Thricherumana, Vdakkumkaavu, Kizhakkumkaavu and Vadakeeswaram.
At Kottiyoor, there are two temples – Akkare Kottiyur and Ikkare Kottiyur, located on the opposite banks of Bavali river. Akkare Kottiyur is open during the Kottiyoor Vaisakha Maholsavam festival only.
A pious Namboothiri of Kalakkatt Illam (one of the four major Mantravada(Sorcery) lineages of Kerala)was returning from Kottiyoor. To pray for Sandhya vandanam in Manathana Shrine he took bath in the pond, after which a young lady from the adjacent bay offered him Taali(herbal shampoo), and told that she would apply it onto his forehead. He immediately recognized that she was none other than Bhadrakali and showing his head would meand his death. He folded his hand in-front of her and said any thing given by The Mother is nectar. He took the shampoo and drank it. Devi was pleased with him and presented him with three sacred insignia which he installed in three temples in the Kannur region.

Sree Kurumba Bhagavati Temple (alternatively Kodungallur Devi Temple) is a Hindu temple at Kodungallur, Thrissur District, Kerala state, India. It is dedicated to the goddess Bhadrakali, a form of Maha Kali or Parashakthi worshipped in Kerala. The goddess is known also by the names “Sri Kurumba” and “Kodungallur Amma” (The Mother of Kodungallur).This temple is the head of 64 Bhadrakali temples in Kerala especially Malabar. The goddess of the temple represents the goddess in her fierce (‘ugra’) form, facing North, featuring eight hands with various attributes. One is holding the head of the demon king Daruka, another a sickle-shaped sword, next an anklet, another a bell, among others. Routine worship at the temple every day at 03:00 and ends at 21:00 local time.
The temple is often accredited as the original form of Goddess Kali.During the reign of Later Cheras, Mahodayapuram (Kodungallur) was the capital of the Chera empire and one of the most important parts of the region. The temple is in the centre of Kerala and is called ‘Malayala Bhagavathi’ by Tamil speakers. The Temple was built in a remote past and its worship incorporates ancient Shaktyem customs which are rarely observed in contemporary Kerala temples.
Kurumbakavu Bhagavathi Temple, popularly known as Kodungallur Bhagavathy Temple is located about 1.5 km southeast of the Kodungallur bus stand. It is assumed that the placement of the idol of Kannaki was done about 1800 years ago by Cheran Chenkuttuvan of the Chera dynasty. The presiding deity of the temple is Bhadrakali (Goddess Kali). The shrine is crowded on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays and is busy during the Sabarimala season as well.
The most famous festival of Kurumbakavu temple is the Bharani festival or Kavutheendal, which starts on the Bharani asterism, as per the Malayalam month of Meenam (March-April). The animal sacrifices that once were part of the festival in this temple are now banned, but the pilgrims still drink liquor and sing lewd songs, all the way from their villages to the shrine, as part of the ceremony. At the end of the festival, the temple closes and opens on the seventh day, after the Aswathi asterism. Another important festival at this temple is the Navarathri.
The temple is situated in the middle of a plot of land about ten acres, surrounded by banyan and peepal trees. The srikovil is facing north. The western chamber of the inner temple is the seat of Sapthamatrukas (Seven Mothers) who also face north. The idols of Ganapathi and Veerabhadra are found in the chamber, one facing east and the other facing west, respectively. The idol of bhagawati is about seven feet high and made of wood, carved from a jackfruit tree. The idol has eight arms that carry weapons and symbols.[5]
To the left of the temple sits a small stone structure called ‘the Samadhi of Vysoori’, perhaps a medieval shrine for a deity of smallpox, chicken pox, mumps and other contagious diseases. Devotees make offerings of turmeric powder, sprinkled and rubbed on its walls. About fifty metres further is a sacred pond called (Pushkarini), where devotees bathe before entering the main shrine. It is believed that this pond was created by the goddess by striking the ground with her sword.
It is said that the temple was constructed by Cheraman Perumal. The first Shakteya Pooja in kodungallur temple was performed by a Thiyyar from Malabar. Even present day , The Thiyya thandans (A administrative position) of 64 tharas meet at Nilapaduthara at Kodungaloor in the presence of kodungallur raja. The kodungaloor meena bharani is conducted under these Thiyya thandans.
In Tantric terms, the divinity is installed in what is called the “Rurujit Vidhaana” pattern, a form of installation with Shiva in one end, Ganesha in the other, with the Sapta Matrikagoddesses in between.
According to another belief, Kannaki, the heroine of Ilango Adigal’s Tamil story Silappathikaram attained salvation. She came to Kodungallur, prayed to Bhadrakali of Kodungallur and became absorbed in the murti.
In ancient times, animal sacrifices were offered at the temple, mostly in the forms of birds and goats, by devotees seeking protection and the fulfillment of their prayers. At the intervention of many “social reformers,” the government of Cochin banned animal sacrifice in any form at this place. At present, only red-dyed dhotis are offered to the deity. Many devotees offer rich presents and gold ornaments.
The people of Kodungallur believe that this temple was, in the olden days, a Shiva shrine and it was Parasurama who installed the murti of Bhadrakali close to one of Shiva. The pujas are conducted, it is said, under direct instructions from the goddess herself. Five ‘Sri Chakras’, said to have been installed by Adi Shankaracharya, are believed to be the main source of the powers of this deity. The priests are Namboodiris and Adikas (Madhu Brahmins) who have a right to perform ‘Pushpanjalis’ to the Goddess.

Kadampuzha Devi Temple is a Hindu temple and pilgrimage center at Kadampuzha in Malappuram district, Kerala, India. The temple is dedicated to goddess Durga (Form of Goddess Parvati), a Devi. There is no idol in the temple, and the Goddess is worshipped in a pit. There are also shrines for Sastha and Serpent deities, along with the worship of Ganapathi, Narasimha and Sudarshana. There is also a Shiva temple nearby, called ‘Madambiyarkavu’. The temple, owned by Malabar Devaswom Board under the Government of Kerala, is administered through a trust consisting of the Hindu-Variar family and non hereditary co-opted trustees. It is the richest temple under Malabar Devaswom Board.
The origin of this temple is associated with the epic Mahabharata. During the 5th year of exile, Arjuna left the place in order to seek and obtain the knowledge of Divya Astras, which could be obtained only by performing the greatest penance with sincerity and devotion. Arjuna wanted Pashupathastra, the supreme astra of Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva and his consort Goddess Parvati wanted to test Arjuna. Disguised as Kirata King and wife, respectively, they approached Arjuna. At the same time, a demon named Mukasura took the form of a wild boar and destroyed nature in order to disturb Arjuna’s meditation.
Both Lord Shiva and Arjuna shot an arrow and killed Mukasura. Lord Shiva, disguised as the Kirata king argued with Arjuna and they finally came to conclusion that they would have a bow and arrow battle. In the fierce battle, Arjuna was defeated. Disappointed over the defeat, he placed a big stone in front of him and prayed to Goddess Adi Parashakthi. The flowers he showered on the stone fell at the feet of Kirata and Kirati. He then realized that those were Lord Shiva and Devi Parvathi. Pleased with this, Lord Shiva granted him the arrow he desired.
The hole, divined to be the one created by the mighty arrow of Lord Shiva that summoned Ganaga for quenching Parvathi’s thirst, was perceived as the Devine Power Source by Adi Shankara and hence there is no idol to represent the Presence here. That there are no idols here is also a unique aspect of Kadampuzha. To mark this place and for the common man’s reference, a Thidambu or Arch is kept on top. Only during the “Poo Moodal” rite the Thidumbu is removed and the hole exposed.
Adi Shankara built the temple over this spot in the method prescribed by Thachu Sastra and on the stone right in front of this, the where the divine presence of Lord Shiva was perceived, he consecrated Narasimha Moorthy and the Sudarshana Chakra each facing South and North respectively. On the South side of the temple Naga Kanya was consecrated and Shastav on the North.
Then, around 1949, when Shree M.K Achutha Warier was the trustee, the sanctum sanctorum was rebuilt using laterite stones and the roof was built using jack wood and tiles. However, only the North side was completed and the other three were laid bare. During this time the pilgrimage to the temple was rather bleak and the temple trustees found the upkeep rather tough.
Then in 1974, a Deva Prashnam was conducted and according to the divinations then made, Bharmashree Andaladi Divakaran Namboothiripad was made the Thantri (Chief Priest) and the compensatory poojas and other poojas for prosperity conducted by him brought about a huge change. Pilgrims started to folk Kadampuzha again and year after year this improved. Deva Prashnam was conducted again in 1984 and 1993 and whatever compensatory rituals suggested at those times were also religiously carried out. In the Deva Prashna of 1993, it was divined that the sanctum sanctorum was to be rebuilt using granite stones and the roof should be paved with brass and immediately the work was taken up and what we see is the result of that. The sanctum sanctorum was built using a complex calculation known as “Siddharthakam”

The Chottanikkara (correction of Jyotiannakkara) Devi Temple is a famous temple of mother goddess Lakshmi Devi known as Sree Bhagavathi. Lakshmi is believed to be residing in Chottanikkara along with Lord Vishnu. The temple is located at Chottanikkara, a southern suburb of the city of Kochi in the state of Kerala, India and is one of the most popular temples in the state. In terms of temple architecture, Chottanikkara temple stands out to be an ultimate testimonial for the ancient vishwakarma sthapathis (wooden sculpture) along with Sabarimala temple. Sree Mahamaya Bhagawati (Aadiparashakthi), the goddess of power, is one of the most popular deities in Kerala and the supreme mother goddess in Hinduism. Chottanikkara Devi is worshipped at the temple, in three different forms: as Maha Saraswati in the morning, draped in white; Maha Lakshmi at noon, draped in crimson; and as Maha Kali in the evening, decked in blue. Supreme lord Shiva, Ganesh & Lord Dharmasastha (Ayyappa) is also worshiped at the temple. People suffering from mental illnesses & commonly visit the temple, as Chottanikkara devi is said to cure her devotees. One should not miss the ‘Guruthi Pooja’ in the ‘Keezhkkaavu’ temple at Chottanikkara. Goddess ‘keezhkkaavu devi’ is believed to be ‘Bhadrakali'(Mahakali), in her fierce form or ugra form. Bhadrakali, is a form of mother Kali, supposed to be born from the third eye of lord Shiva, to kill the demon king ‘Daruka’. Guruthi pooja is a ritual done at late evening to invoke goddess Mahakali. Earlier ‘Guruthi Pooja’ was done only on Fridays. But nowadays, it is performed every day.
‘Chottanikara ‘Makam thozhal’ is the famous religious temple festival.
The area in which the temple is situated was once a dense jungle that is to said to be infested by yakshis and raktharakshas. A tribesman named Kannappan used to live in this forest. He was a devout worshipper of Kali, and would ritually sacrifice a cow to her every Friday(the day of the Goddess). One day, he found a beautiful black calf near the forest. He kidnapped the calf and took her to his altar. Just before he sacrificed the calf, tribesman’s daughter Manimanga stepped in and pleaded to him to stop the sacrifice. The man loved his daughter and thus let her keep the calf as a pet. Unfortunately, Manimanga died some days later, possibly due to a snake bite. Kannappan broke into tears and decided to cremate her body. To his surprise, his daughter’s corpse disappeared. A nearby priest told him the reason for such an occurrence; Kannappan used to forcibly take young calves from their mothers and sacrificed them. As punishment, he met the same fate when his daughter died. However, when the tribes man looked for the calf, he found two divine stones in its place. The priest again tells him that the stones were actually divine and that they represented the divine couple, Vishnu and Lakshmi, and to pray before these stones everyday and he would be forgiven for what he had done in the past.
Since Kannappan’s death, the stones were forgotten. One day, a grass-cutter came to the forest to cut some wild grass. Since her knife was blunt, she sharpened it on what she thought was a big stone. Only it was a stone, but then it started bleeding. Horrified at what she saw, she brought the matter to the public’s attention. A nearby priest was called to solve the problem. After devaprasnam, it was concluded that the stones were divine.
Another legend associated to the temple was that of the spiritual leader Shankaracharya(Adi Shankara). During the time where he lived, Adi Shankara realised that there wasn’t a single temple in Kerala that signified the worship of goddess Lakshmi. As a result, he himself went to the Kodachadri hills in Karnataka and meditated for many days for the goddess to appear before him. His meditation bore fruit and before him stood the stunningly beautiful goddess, clad in red. On enquiry, he said that he would like to bring the goddess to Kerala and establish a temple dedicated to her worship. This way the people from Kerala would not have to go such far off distances to worship her, as in the case for those who were old and aged. After a lot of persuasion, the goddess agreed; she would follow him by foot wherever he went, but only on one condition. If he trusts her, then he was not allowed to look back to see if she followed him or not. If he did, then wouldn’t go any further. He agrees and they proceed walking. They were walking down the Kodachadri hills, with Shankara leading the way and goddess’ anklets tinkling and letting him know that she was with him. After walking some distance, the tinkling stopped all of a sudden. Shankara waited a few moments and stole a quick look backwards to find the goddess still with him, watching him with reproach. In keeping with the condition, the goddess stopped right there. Shankara, however, was not one to give up. He apologized profusely for breaking the condition and repeatedly begged and pleaded with the goddess to go with him to Kerala. After many pleas, the goddess agrees to a compromise. From early hours of morning, she would come and appear before the devotees at the Chottanikkara temple. Then in the afternoon, she would return to the spot where she stopped. This is the spot which would turn out to be the Mookambika temple. Since then, before the doors of the main sanctum in Mookambika temple were opened, the sanctum doors of the Chottanikkara temple were opened during early morning hours in honour of worshipping goddess Saraswati, where the idol is clad in white garments.
The idol at Keezhkavu didn’t come until after the temple was built. One night, a Brahmin was walking along a moonlit trail. Suddenly, he saw a beautiful woman, standing all alone. He offered to escort her home, and she agreed. On the way, he had to stop by a priest’s house to whom he had to return a holy manuscript. Reluctantly, the woman agreed to wait for him outside the house. But when the priest enquired the Brahmin as to who had accompanied him at such odd hours of night, he tells the priest that a woman followed him. Sensing danger, the priest warns him that the woman could be a Yakshi. The helpless Brahmin asks the priest for help, to which the priest gives some holy stones and says that whenever he felt that the woman was near him, he had to throw the stone at the woman without turning back. This would slow her down and further increase the distance from him. Using these stones the Brahmin had to reach the chottanikkara temple lest the yakshi would not harm him. The Brahmin does so accordingly, but as he reached the steps of the temple’s sanctum, the woman held him down and transformed into her true form; a blood thirsty vampire. The Brahmin calls for help, to which goddess Parvatiappeared and transformed into Mahakali, an aspect representing her anger. She subdues the vampire and kills her. The goddess then went to wash herself in the pond, where the Kali idol was found hundreds of years later by Vilwamangalam of Guruvayoor.

Chakkulathu Kavu is a Hindu temple, dedicated to goddess Durga. The temple is located in Neerattupuram, Thalavady panchayat, Alappuzha District, Kerala and is one of the most popular temples in the state.
Durga is one of the most popular deities in the area. Pilgrims from all over South India visit and worship the Devi. The temple was less known even to the local residents and lay as a family temple of a local resident. This remained until it was renovated a few decades before.
Located on the banks of the holy Pampa River, this temple has attracted pilgrims all over Kerala and became one of the most popular pilgrim centre of the state.
The major festival is Pongala which takes place in the temple during the month of Vrischikam (November/December). This is the time when the glory of the Goddess is at its peak. Lakhs of women devotees gather around the temple as early as even one week before the function. The temple premises will be overcrowded and the devotees arrange places for offering the pongala on both sides of the main streets. The queue usually extends to a surprising length of 20 km. Rice, coconut and jaggery are brought by women devotees along with round earthen pots for cooking. The Chief Priest lights the main hearth from the divine fire inside the sanctum sanctorum. This fIre is exchanged from one oven to another.
Panthrandu Noyampu is another festival celebrated at the temple. This is the type of fasting and prayer that qualifies the devotee for the eternal blessings of Chakkulathamma. This fasting starts every year from the first day of the Malayalam month of Dhanu till the twelfth.
Specifically, on the first Friday of December, Dhanu is a significant ritual that sees a male priest wash the feet of fasting women devotees in a mark of respect for the divinity inherent in every woman. Celebrating womanhood, which as per the Vedas and other Hindu scriptures is the highest form of power, takes centre stage during this festival during which only women are allowed to enter the temple premises. Like the Attukal Bhagavathy temple, the Chakkulathukavu temple also celebrates the Pongala festival every year, which is also basically a women-specific celebration.
Chakkulathamma is famously known as the Mother who answers the call of her devotees. Countless pilgrims irrespective of caste creed and colour reach the shrine. The benevolent look of Goddess unfolds a thousand lotus flowers of real bhakthi in the minds of devotees.
There is an eternal divinity which is the ultimate cause for the creation as well sustenance of this universe. As oil in sesame seeds, water in river beds and fire in friction sticks, this divinity defines all that we see and see not, all that we know and not know   or all that we hear and hear not. The concept of Goddess which in way is a manifestation of Nature is the supreme symbol of this divinity that shapes us. The Devi at Chakkulatukavu temples is a benign example of the love and motherliness that Almighty showers upon any devotee who seats that inimitable Goddess in his heart.
Let us have a look at the temple history that dates back to almost 3000 years. This area where the temple stands now has been a fearful forest. Trees that seemed to touch the sky, serpents with hissing noises and wild animals in barbaric freedom created and atmosphere one would shudder to think. Rays of the sun failed to look through the trees. Afternoons were like midnights.
Into this forest came a hunter with the idea of collecting firewood. The hunter was not alone. He had his wife and children with him. But everything was so sudden and unexpected. The hunter saw a serpent moving towards him. Its hood was erect and its hissing noise was fearful. Not thinking too much the hunter attacked the snake with his axe.
But the snake was not hurt it only slipped into the forest. An expert in the habits of animals, the hunter knew too well that an attacked snake is dangerous if spared. So he followed it. Searching and searching and still he couldn’t spot out the snake. Finally he reached a lake. It was not much difficult to observe a ‘Chithalputtu’. (A cover of sand made by insects).
The hunter had a touch of horror. The next second he saw that the shell upon which the snake coiled was broken. Water was oozing out f it. The hunter watched with awe and wonder. Now there was ‘Akshatham’ (paddy and rice) and ‘Darbha’ (a peculiar type of grass used for pujas). Meanwhile the wife and kids of the hunter joined him. All were spell bound at the unbelievable sight in front of them.
Many places near the temple have derived their original names from the history of the temple. For instance, the water in the historical pond of the temple had the sweetness of jaggery. ‘Chakkarkulam’ became shortened in the long run and came to be known as Chakkulam. ‘Neeru’ in Malayalam means water. Water was absorbed into the sand shell which contained the idol. So the place around the temple came to be called as ‘Neerattupuram’. ‘Puram means place and the word denotes the place which carried and contained the holy water.
The temple was renovated in 1981. The illuminating idol of Vana Durga with the holy eight hands is installed near the original idol. Lord Shiva, Sastha, Vishnu, Vinayaka, Muruka, Yakshi, Serpent Gods and Navagrahas are installed as ‘Upa Devas’.
The ancient history of the temple has some divine connections with the story of Sumbha and Nishumbha referred to in the Devi Mahatmyam. The story goes that two demoniac characters called Sumbha and Nishumbha derived superhuman powers through rigorous meditation of Lord Brahma. They received a boon that they could be killed only through a battle with a woman. Such a condition being almost impossible, Sumbha and Nishumbha conquered Indra and other Devas. They became the unquestioned monarchs of the three worlds. The helpless Devas under had to flee away and take shelter in remote jungles.
Saint Narada feeling pity at the misery of the Gods approaches his father Lord Brahma. Brahma reminds Narada that ups and downs are the law of life and that was what the Gods were experiencing. There was only one way out for this despicable state of affairs. Only one power could restore power and prosperity to Gods and that power was none other than the very Goddess. Devas accordingly moved in search of Goddess. Reaching near Himavan, the epic King of the mountains, they started chanting powerful mantras to appease the Goddess. They plunged into a he artful tribute of the Goddess who in herself was power, knowledge, creativity, benevolence and blessings.
Goddess Parvathy had just arrived on the banks of river Ganga. Echoes of the mantras reached her. There was a touch of grief and pleading in the sounds of Devas. Goddess Parvathy grasped the pitiable plight of Devas. There emerged another Goddess from within her as if something comes out of a cover. This was the incarnation of Goddess Durga, having taken a divine form to rescue the Devas from the hardships caused by the asuras.
The story culminates in a terrible fight between the “Goddess and Asuras under the leadership of Sumba and Nishumbha. It was an encounter unheard of ever before. Needless to specify, all the asuras were annihilated by the Goddess. The Devas got back the early powers and prosperities. Sage Narada appears in front of them and exults them about the invincibility of goddess Durga. She was the cause as well as witness for the creation, maintenance and destruction of the universe, told Narada.
It is believed that the Goddess residing in Chakkulathukavu is a wholesome reaction of this all-pervading Goddess namely Durga.

The Attukal Bhagavathy Temple is a Hindu religious shrine at Attukal, Trivandrum in Kerala, India. Goddess Bhadrakali (Kannaki), mounted over ‘vethala’, is the main deity in this temple. Bhadrakali, a form of Mahakali, who killed the demon king Daruka, believed to be born from the third eye of lord Shiva. ‘Bhadra’ means good and ‘Kali’ means goddess of time. So Bhadrakali is considered as the goddess of prosperity and salvation. Goddess ‘Attukal devi’, itself is the supreme mother ‘Bhaadrkali devi’, (in soumya aspect) the goddess of power and courage. She is often referred as Kannaki, the heroine of Ilanko Adikal’s ‘Silapathikaaram’. 
The temple is renowned for the annual Attukal Pongala festival, in which over three million women participate.[1] A festival that has figured in the Guinness Book of World Records for being the single largest gathering of women for religious activity, the Attukal Pongala continues to draw millions of women with each passing year. According to the Attukal Temple Trust, around 4.5 million devotees are expected to attend the pongala in 2016. Attukal Temple is situated near the heart of the city, 2 kilometres away from Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple, East Fort in Thiruvananthapuram. Devotees believe that all of their wishes will be fulfilled by the goddess, provide prosperity and can attain salvation. Attukal Devi is often worshipped in 3 forms such as Maha Saraswati (goddess of knowledge), Maha Lakshmi (goddess of wealth) and Mahakali/ Durga/ Parvathy
The Goddess Kannaki (Bhadrakali) is the main deity in this temple. The mythology behind the temple, relates to the story of Kannagi who was married to Kovalan, son of a wealthy merchant. After marriage, Kovalan met a dancer Madhavi and spent all his riches on her forgetting his wife. But when he was penniless, he went back to Kannagi. The only precious thing left to be sold was Kannagi’s pair of anklets. They went with it to the king of Madurai to sell it. But an anklet was stolen from the Queen which looked similar to Kannagi’s. When Kovalan tried to sell it, he was mistaken for the theft and beheaded by the king’s soldiers.
Kannagi got infuriated when she heard the news and rushed to the King with the second pair of anklet. She broke one of the anklets and it contained rubies while the Queen’s contained pearls. She cursed the city of Madurai, and it is said that due to her chastity, the curse came true and Madurai burned. Kannagi is said to have attained salvation after the Goddess of the city appeared before her.
It is said that on her way to Kodungallur, Kannagi passed Attukal. She took the form of a little girl. An old man was sitting on the banks of a stream when the girl went to him and asked him whether he could help her cross it. Surprised to find the young girl alone, he took her home. But she disappeared. She came back in his sleep and asked him to build a temple where he found 3 golden lines in his grove. He went ahead and did the same, and it is said that this is at the location of the present Attukal temple. Goddess Kodungallooramma (Bhadrakali/Kannaki) is believed to be present at Attukal during the festival days. Ponkala is offered to celebrate the victory of Kannaki over the king Pandya. Another story says that ‘Attukal Devi is Bhadrakali, born from the third eye of Lord Shiva to kill the demon king Daruka. Mother Bhadrakali is a form of Shakthi Devi (Mahakali) worshipped mainly in Kerala. ‘Bhadra’ means good and ‘Kali’ means goddess of time. So Bhadrakali is often referred to as the goddess of prosperity, time and salvation. Mohanlal got married at this temple in 1988.

The metal plated flagpost or Dwajasthambam is located axial to the temple tower leading to the central sanctum and there is a Deepastamba, which is the light post. Chuttuambalam is the outer pavilion within the temple walls. The central shrine and the associated hall is located in a rectangular structure called Nallambalam, which has pillared halls and corridors.Between the entrance of Nallambalam to the sanctum, there is a raised square platform called Namaskara Mandapawhich has a pyramidal roof. Thevrapura, the kitchen used to cook offering to the deity is located on the left of Namaskara Mandapa from the entrance. Balithara is an altar is used for making ritualistic offering to demi-gods and the festive deities.

There is yet another legend associated with Parthasarathy here. During the battle of Kurukshetra, Duryodhana had taunted Bheeshma of not using his full might in fighting the Pandavas. This taunt by Duryodhana filled Bheeshma with rage. Bheeshma took a vow to fight with such ferocity the next day that Lord Krishna himself would be forced to break his vow of not using a weapon during the war in order to protect Arjuna. On the ninth day of the battle of Kurukshetra, the Kauravas reigned supreme under the leadership of Bheeshma, when Krishna motivated Arjuna to take initiative and vanquish his foe. Bheeshma was unparalleled with the use of celestial weapons in such a manner that Arjuna could not counter the onslaught. Arrows after arrows fired from Bheeshma’s bow breached the defenses of Arjuna and inflicted wounds to his body by penetrating his armour. The string of Arjuna’s bow, the Gandiva was snapped during the battle. Seeing Arjuna’s plight, Krishna jumped down in rage, and took up his discus charging towards Bheeshma. Bheeshma was overfilled with joy and surrendered to Lord Krishna. Meanwhile, Arjuna beseeched the Lord not to kill Bheeshma, as it would have been against Krishna’s vow to take up arms in his battle. It is believed that it is this image of Krishna that is enshrined here, with a discus. This symbolizes the Lord’s act of compassion to both his devotees on either side of the battle. Lord Krishna broke his vow to protect Arjuna and also to fulfill the promise that his ardent devotee Bheeshma had made.[2]
Lord Krishna presiding here in the Vishvarupa form is considered as ‘Annadana Prabhu’ (The Lord who provides food) along with other temples like Vaikom Mahadeva Templeand Sabarimala. It is believed that those whose Annaprashana is performed at the Aranmula Parthasarathy temple would never be affected by the pangs of poverty throughout their life.

https://www.bharattemples.com/ananthapura-lake-temple-kasaragod-kerala/,"Ananthapura Lake Temple, Kasaragod, Kerala
Ananthapadmanabhaswamy Temple or Anantha Lake Temple is a Hindu temple built in the middle of a lake in the little village of Ananthapura, around 6 km from the town of Kumbla in Manjeswaram taluk of Kasaragod District of Kerala, South India. This is the only lake temple in Kerala and is believed to be the original seat (Moolasthanam) of Ananthapadmanabha Swami (Padmanabhaswamy temple) Thiruvananthapuram. Legend has it that this is the original site where Ananthapadmanabha settled down.
The lake in which the Sanctum Sanctorum is built measures about 2 acres (302 feet square). An interesting spot to keep in mind while visiting the temple is a cave to the right corner of the lake. According to the local legend, the deity Anantha Padmanabha chose to go all the way to Thiruvananthapuram through that cave. Hence both the places retain similar names, in spite of being on either end of the region.
The temple is unique in its structural aspects for it is erected in the middle of an impressive lake of 302 feet. The lake is gifted with a perennial supply of pure spring water. We can find the ruins of temples all round the lake which stand testimony to the fact that it was part of a great temple complex. The sreekovil (sanctum sanctorum), namaskara-mandapam, thitappalli, and shrines of Jala-Durga and the entrance of the cave are located in the lake. The namaskara mandapam is connected to the eastern rock by a foot-bridge which is the only passage to the sreekovil.
The principal deity is Lord Vishnu. One of the key features of the temple is that the original idols in the sanctum sanctorum were not made of metal or stone, but of a rare combination of more than 70 medicinal materials called `kadu-sharkara-yogam.’ These idols were replaced by panchaloha metals in 1972. They were donated by Kaanchi Kaamakoti Mathaadhipathi His Holiness Jayendra Saraswathi Thiruvatikal. Efforts are going on now to reinstall the idols made with `kadu-sharkara-yogam.’ The Lord Vishnu idol is in a sitting pose over a five-hooded serpent king Lord Anantha. The lake temple is open to all visitors regardless of caste or creed. The District Tourism Promotion Council has plans to preserve the temple and its surroundings for its uniqueness.
The temple has an excellent collection of wood carvings on the ceilings of the mandapam. These carvings depict the incidents taken from the stories of Dashavatharam (the ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu). Some of them are painted. The Nava-grahas (nine planets) are painted at the muktha-mandapam. On either side of the sreekovil, dwaara-palakas (Jays and Vijaya) are beautifully carved in wood.
The past of the temple is still obscure except for some myths. It was at this place where Divakara Muni Vilwamangalam, the great Tulu Brahmin sage, did penance and performed poojas. Legend has it that one day Lord Narayana appeared before him as a child. The boy’s face was glowing with radiance and this overwhelmed the sage. He became anxious and asked who he was. The boy replied that he had no father no mother and none at home. Vilwamangalam felt pity for the boy and allowed him to stay there. The boy proposed a condition that whenever he feels humiliated he will leave the place at once. He served the sage for sometime. But soon his juvenile pranks became intolerable for the sage and he reacted violently. Humiliated the boy disappeared from there after proclaiming that if Vilwamangalam wants to see him he would have to go to Ananthankat, the forest of serpent god Anantha.
Vilwamangalam soon realized that the boy was none but the lord himself and he had great repentance. He found a cave at the place where the boy disappeared and he proceeded further into the cave in search of the boy. He reached the sea and proceeded further toward the south and at last he reached a woody area near the sea. Vilwamangalam saw the child who soon disappeared into huge illippa tree (Indian butter tree or Mahua tree). Immediately the tree fell down and assumed the shape of Lord Vishnu lying on a thousands hooded serpent.
The temple is open to all regardless of religion or caste. The nearest major railway station to Ananthapura Lake Temple is Kasaragod railway station which is about 12 km from here. There is also a railway station at Kumbla. Mangalore Airport is the nearest airport which is about 60 km from here. Karipur International Airport, Kozhikode is about 200 km. To reach there by road one has to take a deviation from Naikap (4 km from Kumbla) on the Kumbala-Badiyadka road.

https://www.bharattemples.com/ambalappuzha-sri-krishna-temple-alapuzha-karnataka/,"Ambalappuzha Sri Krishna Temple,  Alapuzha, karnataka
Ambalappuzha Sri Krishna Temple (Malayalam: അമ്പലപ്പുഴ ശ്രീകൃഷ്ണ ക്ഷേത്രം) is a Hindu temple in Ambalappuzha, Alapuzha district of Kerala, in south India.
The Ambalappuzha Sri Krishna Temple is believed to have been built during 15th – 17th AD by the local ruler Chembakasserry Pooradam Thirunal-Devanarayanan Thampuran.
The idol at Ambalapuzha is likened to Parthasarthi (പാർത്‌ഥസാരഥി) with a whip in the right hand and a Shankhu (sacred conch) in the left. This temple is directly associated to the Guruvayoor Sree Krishna Temple. During the raids of Tipu Sultan in 1789, the idol of Sri Krishna from the Guruvayoor Temple was brought to the Ambalappuzha Temple for safe keeping. It kept safely for 12 years.
The payasam served in the Ambalappuzha Temple is famous among Hindu devotees. This sweet pudding made of rice and milk has an interesting mythological legend behind it.It is believed that Guruvayoorappan reaches here daily at the time of Palpayasa Nedyam
Ambalapuzha is 14 km south of Alappuzha town. Ambalapuzha’s fame is attributed to this temple. The 16th century-built temple is very famous in South Kerala and its prasadam (deity’s food given to devotees as a token of blessing), Palpayasam (milk kheer), more commonly known as Ambalapuzha Palpayasam is mouth-watering and very famous throughout Kerala. The deity of the temple situated on the banks of Ambalapuzha River is Sri Krishna. Ambalapuzha itself means the river of temple (ambala means temple and puzha means river). The birth of this temple is twined with fascinating stories. The Champakasseri King, Moolam Thirunal Devanarayanan, and his mentor Vilwamangalath Swamiyar while cruising in a boat in Ambalapuzha river heard music tune of a flute from the bank. They shored the boat and moved forward towards the music emanting point when they noticed a beautiful boy playing the flute sitting on a branch of a peepul tree. The religious stalwart Vishwamangalam concluded that this child is none other than divine Krishna. Both, the king and the mentor, prostrated before the child after circumambulating the tree. When they rose from the ground the child was not there. Vishwamangalm lost no time to advice the king to build a temple for Sri Krishna at the spot. A temple thus soon came up there.
There is a conflicting story behind the installed idol. The king ordered idol was not installed as the priests noticed some inaccuracies in the sculpting. Instead, an idol was borrowed from a temple and installed. This is one version. The other version is that the inaccuracies of the king orderd idol was corrected and installed the same. Let it be either way. The idol is of a smiling naughty boy. The idol was brought by a boat and the Chambakulam Boat Race in June/July is in commemoration of this. The 3 ft high idol is always seen covered in sandalwood paste.
King Devanarayanan placed his crown at the feet of Lord Krishna in this temple and dedicated his kingdom to the Lord. The last king of Devanarayanan’s dynasty placed the keys of his granary and treasury before the Lord after his defeat by Travancore.
The walls around the sanctum sanctorum are beautiful with paintings of Dasavathra (ten incarnation of Vishnu).
The main festival of the temple is the 10-day Arattu Utsavam in Meenam (March/April). Processions by several caparisoned tuskers accompanied by vadya-melams (percussion instrument musics) and performances of Velakali, a martial art form, are the main attractions. The procession ends with enchanting fireworks. During the festival devotees are offered a feast and the diners are treated with utmost honour. It is believed, Lord Krishna presents incognito to dine along with the devotees.
According to the legend, God Krishna once appeared in the form of a sage in the court of the king who ruled the region and challenged him for a game of chess (or chaturanga). The king being a chess enthusiast himself gladly accepted the invitation. The prize had to be decided before the game and the king asked the sage to choose his prize in case he won. The sage told the king that he had a very modest claim and being a man of few material needs, all he wished was a few grains of rice. The amount of rice itself shall be determined using the chess-board in the following manner. One grain of rice shall be placed in the first square, two grains in the second square, four in the third square, eight in the fourth square, sixteen in 5th square and so on. Every square will have double of its predecessor.
Upon hearing the demand, the king was unhappy since the sage requested only a few grains of rice instead of other riches from the kingdom which the king would have been happy to donate. He requested the sage to add other items to his prize but the sage declined.
So the game of chess started and needless to say the king lost the game. It was time to pay the sage his agreed-upon prize. As he started adding grains of rice to the chess board, the king soon realised the true nature of the sage’s demands. By the 20th square, the number had reached one million grains of rice and by the 40th square, it became one million million. The royal granary soon ran out of grains of rice. The king realised that even if he provides all the rice in his kingdom and his adjacent kingdoms, he will never be able to fulfill the promised reward. The number of grains was increasing as a geometric progression and the total amount of rice required to fill a 64-squared chess board is ((2^64) – 1) which is equal to the number 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 translating to trillions of tons of rice.
Upon seeing the dilemma, the sage appeared to the king in his true-form, that of God Krishna. He told the King that he did not have to pay the debt immediately but could pay him over time. The king would serve paal-payasam (made of rice) in the temple freely to the pilgrims every day until the debt was paid off.

https://www.bharattemples.com/sudh-mahadev-temple-patnitop/,"The Sudh Mahadev Temple is about 2400 years old and is situated in Udhampur district and a height of 1225 meters. Like many temples located here, this one too has an interesting legend to it. It is said that once Goddess Parvati was immersed in a deep prayer when a demon called Sudheet who was actually an ardent devotee of Shiva, approached her to pay obeisance. However seeing his demonic built, Parvati got frightened and shrieked. Hearing her shriek that echoed across the valley, Lord Shiva came to her rescue and stabbed Sudheet with his Trishula. While doing so he noticed the demon chant his name. Shiva realized he had killed his devotee and trued to bring him back to life. However, the demon replied that getting killed by the holy hands of Lord Shiva would give him ‘moksh’ or salvation. Hearing this Lord Shiva was so pleased that he announced that henceforth, Sudheet’s name would be taken before his own. And as you might have guessed by now, at the place where Parvati was worshipping, a shivling came to be known as Sudhaahadev. What a legend that was. Even today, you will find this shivling and the trishula housed at the Sudh Mahandev Temple. Also , the temple has this eternal flame called ‘dhooni’ which is supposedly burning since Baba Dhoop Nath resided here. The temple is by the banks of River Devak and this adds all the more to its mystic.
       
After taking a bath in the Dewak Nadi, the pilgrims worship Lord Shiva and Parvati in the Temple. After worshipping Gauri Kund, the pilgrims go to Gaukaran, about 0.5Kms from Sudhmahadev. Then they climb up another 2 Kms of mountaineous area to reach another sacred place ‘Nada’.

https://www.bharattemples.com/ardh-kuwari-cave-katra/,"The term Adhkuwari is believed to have come from Adi kumari, which means “The Eternal Virgin”. According to the legend, when Vaishnavi, in the form of a small girl, disappeared from the Bhandaara organized by Pandit Shridhar, she halted at Banganga and Charan Paduka. From there she reached Adhkuwari, where, in a small womb shaped cave she meditated and observed spiritual discipline (Tapasya) for nine long months. The exact spot where she is believed to have meditated is located at the right hand side inside the cave and is shaped like a womb. Since Vaishnavi had observed spiritual discipline in a womb shaped cave for a period of nine months, this cave has become popular by the name of Garbh Joon, which has come from the term Garbh Yoni meaning the Womb. It is generally believed that by merely passing through this cave, a devotee’s sins are cleansed and his soul becomes pious again.

https://www.bharattemples.com/kakanmath-temple-morena-madhya-pradesh/,"Kakanmath Temple, Morena, Madhya Pradesh
Kakanmaṭh is a ruined 11th century Shiva temple located at Sihoniya in Madhya Pradesh, India. It was built by the Kachchhapaghataruler Kirttiraja. Only a part of the original temple complex now survives. Some of the sculptures from the site are now located at Gwalior.
The temple stands on an ornate base (pitha). The building includes a sanctum, a vestibule, and two halls (gudha-mandapa and mukha-mandapa). The sanctum has a circumambulatory path with three transepts. The gudha-mandapa has lateral transepts, and four clusters of pillars; each cluster contains four pillars. The vestibule has four pillars in a row, which are aligned with the four clusters of the gudha-mandapa. The shikhara (tower) of the shrine makes it around 30 m high.
The steps at the entrance had two large lion statues, which are now located at the entrance of the Archaeological Museum, Gwalior. Many other sculptures have also been taken to Gwalior.
The Kakanmath temple was commissioned by Kachchhapaghata ruler Kirttiraja (r. c. 1015-1035 CE).This can be inferred from a Kachchhapaghata inscription found at the Sas-Bahu Temple in Gwalior. The inscription states that Kirttiraja built an extraordinary temple devoted to Parvati’s lord (Shiva) at Siṁhapānīya (modern Sihoniya).
According to a folk legend, the temple was named “Kakanmadh” after Kakanavati or Kakanade, who was the queen of one Surajpala. The historicity of this legend is doubtful. One possibility is that the name of the temple derives from the kanak (gold) and maṭha(shrine).
Originally, the site had a temple complex, with a central temple surrounded by four subsidiary shrines. Only the ruins of the central temple stand now: its outer walls, balconies and a part of its spire have fallen. This damage probably happened during an earthquake.A Sanskrit-language pillar inscription dated 1[4]50 VS (1393-94 CE) records the renovation of the Mahadeva temple (that is, Kakanmath) by one Durgaprasada.A 1497 VS (1440-41 CE) pillar inscription records the visit of a pilgrim named Dekhana during the reign of Dungara (a Tomara ruler of Gwalior). It states that Dekhana was the son of Kakaka, and a resident of Nalapuragaḍha

Sasbahu Temple, also called the Sas-Bahu Mandir, Sas-Bahu Temples, Sahastrabahu Temple or Harisadanam temple, is an 11th-century twin temple in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, India. Near the Gwalior Fort and dedicated to Vishnu in his Padmanabha form, like most Hindu and Jain temples in this region, it is mostly in ruins and was badly damaged from numerous invasions and Hindu-Muslim wars in the region. It was built in 1093 by King Mahipala of the Kachchhapaghata dynasty, according to an inscription found in the larger of the twin temple. The twin temples are situated in the Gwalior Fort.
The temple’s tower and sanctum has been destroyed, but its architecture and damaged carvings can still be appreciated from the ruins. The jagati platform is 100 feet (30 m) long and 63 feet (19 m) wide, on a square plan.The temple was three-storeyed, which was one of its distinguishing features and sophistication. It followed a central cluster concept, states Adam Hardy. The surviving elements of the temple are the entrance porch and the mandapa. According to James Harle, though the prasada (tower, spire) no longer exists, the triple storey plan with a cruciform foundation and balconies suggests that it had a North Indian Bhumija style architecture. This style, states Harle, is marked by a well proportioned superstructure, its “regularly arranged little subordinate sikharas strung out like gigantic beaded garlands”.
This temple mainly has three entrances from three different directions. In the fourth direction, there is a room which is currently closed. The entire temple is covered with carvings, notably 4 idols of Brahma, Vishnu and Saraswati above its entrance door. The pillar carvings show Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism related carvings. The larger temple ornamentation covers all the exterior walls and all surviving interior surfaces.
The twin temple, like elsewhere in India, has locally been called Sasbahu temple. The word Sasbahu means “mother-in-law, bride” or “a mother with her daughter-in-law”, an association that implies their being together and interdependent. The Sas temple is typically the larger older temple of the twin. The Gwalior Sasbahu temple follows this style, but both temples are dedicated to Vishnu. Only the Sas temple has survived in some form, the Bahu temple is a shell structure of the original one storey with a highly ornate door frame and its defaced wall reliefs surviving.The remnants of the Bahu temple at Gwalior suggest that it may have been a smaller version of the Saas temple.
The Sas temple has a square sanctum attached to a rectangular two storey antarala and a closed three storey mandapa with three entrances. The temple main entrance porch has four carved Ruchaka ghatapallava-style pillars that are load-bearing. The walls and lintels are intricately carved, though much defaced. On the lintel of the entrances, friezes of Krishna-leela scenes are carved inside, while the outer side narrate legends from other Hindu texts. Above the lintel is Garuda, the vanaha of Vishnu.
The Bahu temple also has a square sanctum with 9.33 feet (2.84 m) side, with four central pillars. Its maha-mandapa is also a square with 23.33 feet (7.11 m) side, with twelve pillars.The temple, like most Malwa and Rajputana historic temples, provides multiple entrances to the devotee. The roof consists of two rotated squares that intersect to form an octagon capped by successive overlapping circles. The pillars have octagonal bases as well, with girls carved but these have been defaced and mutilated. The sanctum has an image of damaged Vishnu, next to whom stands Brahma holding the Vedas on one side and Shiva holding the trident on the other side.

Katni
The Kankali Devi Temple is often referred to as the Tigawa temple. It is one of the oldest temples of Devi Kali Maa known as one of the Shaktipeeth among Hindu pilgrims. Being so old it is one of the centers of devotion for Hindus. In Shardey Navratri and Chaitra Navratri peoples from all over the country came for Pooja & Darshan. There is one special thing about the statue of Maa Kali, during Navratri the neck of Maa Kali’s statue is slightly tilted from its original position. It is approximately 20Km from Bhopal.
Alexander Cunningham visited Tigawa in 1873 and reported the antiquities of the town. He mentions a rectangular mound of 250 feet long and 120 feet wide which was entirely covered with large blocks of cut-stones. These stones were parts of ruins of various temples, all fallen ace but one which was in good state of preservation. He was told that the mound was utterly destroyed by a railway contractor who collected all the squared stones in a heap together to be used in railway construction. It is mentioned that two hundred carts were used to bring this heap to the foot of hill. This rapacious and destructive activity was stopped by an order from the Deputy Commissioner of Jabalpur but damage was done till that time. Cunningham estimated that the temple would have been about 19.5 feet square. There is an image of Vishnu of later period inside the temple. Various incarnations of Vishnu are depicted around the main image.
The temples were in varying sizes from 4 feet square to 15 feet square. The temples of modest size, 4 to 6 feet square, were covered on three sides and open on east. Temples of medium size, 7 to 10 feet square, were covered on all sides with a doorway on the eastern sides, whereas the large temples, from 10 to 15 feet square, were having an additional portico in front. All these temple, which ruins are only left, were having a shikhara with amalaka on top. No Buddhist or Jains antiquity was found by Cunningham.
The original temple was constituted of a sanctum and an open portico supported on four pillars. At a later stage, the portico was covered with walls containing panels and an addition extension in front of the portico. The sanctum is 12.75 feet square outside and about 8 feet square inside. It is covered with a flat roof. Doorway of the sanctum is done in T-shaped style with over-hanging lintel beyond the door-jambs. Foliage decoration is found on two bands of this doorway. Two pilasters, one on either side, are executed in the typical Gupta order, topped with images of Ganga and Yamuna where both are shown plucking a fruit from a tree. There are seven square bosses on a lintel above the door frame. Cunningham suggests that these bosses might be the representation of the ends of horizontal beams as found in the wooden architecture. An image of Narasimha is placed inside the sanctum.Cunningham suggests that open portico was later converted into a closed mandapa. At the same time, various sculptural panels were also inserted in the side walls of this mandapa. He mentions four such panels however I found only two panels at the site which are adorned in the south wall of the mandapa. One panel depicts Chamunda or Kankali Devi which probably gave the present name of the temple. Another panel shows Vishnu resting on the coils of Adi-shesha in his Sheshashai icon. Another portico of quite a different style was also added at later stages. There is a sculptural panel on this portico which iconography is difficult to understand. The panel shows a seated mendicant with elongated ears and wearing a large crown over his head. The posture of the mendicant is usually seen in Buddhist and Jainism sculptures however I am not very sure of its religious nature.

It was established by the Hindu religious leader Jagadguru Rambhadracharya on August 2, 1987.Rambhadracharya believes that this Peeth is situated at the place where the Hindu god Rama gave his sandals to his brother Bharat.
The Tulsi Peeth premises house the residence of Rambhadracharya, a temple known as Kanch Mandir with an attached hall called Raghav Satsang Bhavan, a small cow-pen, a school for visually disabled students, a temple known as the Manas Mandir which has the entire Ramcharitmanas engraved on its inside walls, and an exhibition of moving models from 16 scenes of Ramcharitmanas.There is also a hostel for students of Jagadguru Rambhadracharya Handicapped University (JRHU).
The activities of the Tulsi Peeth include study and propagation of Hindu religious texts in Sanskrit and Hindi, service of cows and Sadhus, publication of a monthly magazine, and organization of camps providing aids to for persons with disability.The institution has published various books authored by Rambhadracharya.
In 1983, Rambhadracharya (then known as Rambhadradas) undertook his second six-month Payovrata, taking a diet of only milk and fruits and speaking only Sanskrit, at the Sphatik Shila in Chitrakoot. The Yuvraj of Chitrakoot, Hemraj Singh Chaturvedi, was impressed by Rambhadracharya and donated a 60 feet by 80 feet land area situated besides the Mandakini river at Janki Kund to Rambhadradas.Gita Devi, Rambhadradas’s elder sister, persuaded him to get an Ashram built on this plot. Rambhadradas got four rooms constructed there and started visiting the place frequently. He undertook a nine-month Payovrata at this newly built Ashram in 1986. He also started performing his Kathas there.Ramcharandas Phalahari, the Sampradaya Guru of Rambhadradas, wanted Rambhadradas to stay with him at his Ashram in Prayag, but Rambhadradas was reluctant. In 1988, Umacharan Gupta, a businessman from Manikpur offered to build a bigger Ashram and a temple on the condition that Rambhadradas stay there permanently. Rambhadradas agreed and the construction started. On 11 March 1987, the Kanch Mandir (literally glass-temple) was opened and Rambhadradas started living permanently in Chitrakoot. Following this, on the occasion of Tulsi Jayanti on August 2, 1987, he established Tulsi Peeth at the site of the Ashram. As the founder of the seat of Tulsi, the title of Śrīcitrakūṭatulasīpīṭhādhīśvara (literally The Lord of the Tulsi Peeth at Chitrakoot) was bestowed upon Rambhadracharya by Sadhus and intellectuals.Rambhadracharya believes that this Peeth is situated at the place where, according to the epic Ramayana, the Hindu god Rama gave his sandals to his brother Bharat.

The word Dewas is also believed to be a sandhi of words Dev (deity) and Vas (Marathi for abode), thus Dewas means abode of the deity or god.Also at the bottom of the hill (also called ‘Tekri’) there is Ashram of Shri Vishnu Tirth Maharaj. Ashram is also known with the name ‘NARAYAN KUTI’.
Dewas is a city on the Malwa plateau in the west-central part of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. It is the 6th most populous city of Madhya Pradesh.

Dewas was formerly the capital of two princely states of British India. The original state was founded in the first half of the 18th century by the brothers Tukaji Rao (senior) and Jivaji Rao (junior), from the Puar clan of Marathas. They had advanced into Malwa with the Maratha Peshwa, Baji Rao, in 1728. The brothers divided the territory among themselves; their descendants ruled as the senior and junior branches of the family. After 1841, each branch ruled his own portion as a separate state, though the lands belonging to each were intimately entangled; in Dewas, the capital town, the two sides of the main street were under different administrations and had different arrangements for water supply and lighting.
The senior branch had an area of 446 sq mi (1,160 km2) and a population of in 62,312 in 1901, while the area of the junior branch was 440 sq mi (1,100 km2) and had a population of 54,904 that same year.Both Dewas states were in the Malwa Agency of the Central India Agency.

He was popularly known as Binjana seth. His eldest son kisanlal ruled the region under puar dynasty for six decades. After him his son Seth Vallabhdas Tapdiya had ruled the village. They were the biggest Jagirdars in the kingdom of Maharaj Krishnaji Rao III Puar. After India’s independence in 1947, the Rajas of Dewas acceded to India, and their states were integrated into Madhya Bharat, which became a state of India in 1950. In 1956, Madhya Bharat was merged into Madhya Pradesh state.

The Shiv Ling in the temple is 8′ x 10.5′ and weighs 4.6 tons. The temple built on the river is 90 feet long, 30 feet wide and 101 feet tall. On top of the temple is a 100 kg gold plated pitcher. Every monsoon the water level in the Shivna river rises to touch the holy Shiv Ling of lord Shiva. This phenomenon is termed as “Jalaabhishek” which means worshiping god through the water.
Gradually the idols of other Hindu gods such as goddess Maata Paarvati,  Ganesha,  Kartikeya, goddess Maata Ganga,  Vishnu, goddess Maata Lakshmi and Saint  Adyashankaracharya were established within the temple with a huge idol of Nandi Maharaaj facing the west face of the idol Lord Pashupatinath with eight-faced.
According to the Hindu mythology, the temple of Pashupatinath was constructed many centuries ago. It is said that the Shiv Ling emerged from the waters of the Shivna on Monday, which is considered as an auspicious day by the devotees of Lord Shiva. On Sunday, it reached the Tapeshwar Ghat of the river and was placed there. On Monday, after exactly, 21 years, 5 months and 4 days it was incarnated. The day of incarnation of the idol is celebrated as a Mela in the area surrounding the temple.
The Temple is open from 06:00 AM to 8:00 PM (All days of the week). The climate condition in Mandsaur is changeable. It means, during winters temperature dropping down to 32 to 14 degree Celsius while in summers it rises to 34 to 44 degree Celsius. However, monsoon occurs especially in the month of July that offers good rainfall. So the best time to get there is from October to March.
Madhya Pradesh or the ‘Heart of Incredible India’ is the home to the cultural heritage of the sub-continent. From monuments with intricate architecture to national parks and wildlife reserves, it’s a perfect mix of adventure and culture for tourists visiting India. In addition, it is also the world heritage site for the monuments like Khajuraho, Buddhist monuments at Sanchi as well. Being located at the centre of the sub-continent, it is also a famous pilgrimage destination. The Pashupatinath Temple Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh is located on the banks of the Shivna River. Lord Shiva is worshipped here as Pashupatinath and is the main deity here. Thousands of pilgrims pay a visit to this temple every day. It is considered a sacred place of worship, especially among the Hindus. The temple sees massive devotees during special occasions and the temple committee comprising of twenty-five members plans the activities well in advance.
Pashupatinath Temple at Mandsaur, also referred to as the Mandasor Shiva temple, is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh India. It belongs to Pashupatinath tradition which is one of 6 major tradition within Shaivism. It is located on Shivna River, and is known for its eight-faced Shiva Linga. The temple sculpture is dated to the 5th or 6th century based on inscriptions, with some referring to the site as Dashapura. It is near the Rajasthan border in the historic region of Malwa, about 200 kilometres (120 mi) from Indore, about 340 kilometres (210 mi) west of Udaigiri Caves and about 220 kilometres (140 mi) east of Shamalaji ancient sites, both a significant source of Gupta Empire era archaeological discoveries.The site has been important to dating and the architectural studies of some distant sites such as the Elephanta Caves.
The site’s history is traceable to the 2nd-century CE when it was already a Hindu pilgrimage site.[3] It is mentioned by the ancient Indian poet Kalidasa, who praises the women of Dashapura as “so practiced in their seductive movements”. Ten inscriptions found in the area suggest the Mandasor site was an important cultural and religious center in the first half of the 1st millennium CE.Nine of these inscriptions are Sanskrit poems, most dated between 404 and 487 CE, and all include invocations to Hindu gods such as Vasudeva and Shiva in various forms. They mention kings of Gupta Empire era, as well as temples of Dashapura.Together with dozens of temples discovered at a number of sites in western Madhya Pradesh, eastern Rajasthan and northern Gujarat region, the Mandasor site with the Shiva Stele and the temple reflect what Stella Kramrisch called one of the “Western schools” of ancient and early medieval Indian art.James Harle concurs and includes the nearby Sondni and Kilchipura sites to the Western school along with regions farther west.According to Harle, the sculpture from the temple and other archaeological findings such as the Mandasor inscriptions – one of which he calls “the longest and certainly the most beautiful of the Gupta inscriptions” – reflect the “flavor of life at its best in Gupta times”.
The inscriptions, state Harle and other scholars, suggest that the sculpture and temples of Mandasor were built with resources pooled by the common people, such as silk weavers of Dashapura (Mandasor) who had settled there from Gujarat.However, these inscriptions mention a Sun temple, a Vishnu temple and others. They do not mention the Pashupatinath temple. Excavations have yielded several brick temples of Shiva which have been dated to the 6th century, suggesting that Shiva was a prominent deity along with others in ancient Mandasor.Additionally, only the foundations of most early temples and monuments are presently identifiable, as the Buddhist, Hindu and Jain temples in Mandasor were demolished and its stones and relief panels used to build a Muslim fort after the region was conquered in the late medieval era.
The eight face Shiva found in the reconstructed Pashupatinath temple is from the 1st millennium CE and a rare iconography. It is 4.5 metres (15 ft) tall and was discovered in the river bed of the Shivana.It has been reconsecrated into the temple. The upper part of the linga has four heads in a line, while the other four heads are carved below them in the second line. The faces have open eyes, with the third eye on their forehead visible.Each face has elaborate hair probably reflecting the culture of its time for men. Each wears jewelry such as earlobes, necklace and more. The eight faces represent the various aspects of Shiva in regional Shaivism theology: Bhava, Pashupati, Mahadeva, Isana, Rudra, Sharva, Ugra and Asani. It is sometimes referred to as Ashtamukha or Ashtamurti. According to Goyala, this Mandasor linga is likely from the early 6th century.

The Kandariya Mahadeva Temple, 31 metres (102 ft) in height, is in the western complex, which is the largest among the three groups of the Khajuraho complex of temples.This western group of temples, consisting of the Kandariya, Matangeshwara and Vishvanatha temples, is compared to a “cosmic design of a hexagon (a yantra or Cosmo gram)” representing the three forms of Shiva.The temple architecture is an assemblage of porches and towers which terminates in a shikhara or spire, a feature which was common from the 10th century onwards in the temples of Central India.
The temple is founded on a massive plinth of 4 metres (13 ft) height. The temple structure above the plinth is dexterously planned and pleasingly detailed. The superstructure is built in a steep mountain shape or form, symbolic of Mount Meru which is said to be the mythical source of creation of the world. The superstructure has richly decorated roofs which rise in a grand form terminating in the shikhara, which has 84 miniature spires. The temple is in the layout of 6 square kilometres (2.3 sq mi), of which 22 are extant including the Kaṇḍāriyā Mahādeva Temple. This temple is characteristically built over a plan of 31 metres (102 ft) in length and 20 metres (66 ft) in width with the main tower soaring to a height of 31 metres (102 ft), and is called the “largest and grandest temple of Khajuraho”.A series of steep steps with high rise leads from the ground level to the entrance to the temple. The layout of the temple is a five-part design, a commonality with the Lakshmana and Vishvanatha temples in the Khajuraho complex. Right at the entrance, there is Torana, a very intricately carved garland which is sculpted from a single stone; such entrances are part of a Hindu wedding procession. The carvings on the entrance gate show the “tactile quality of the stone and also the character of the symmetrical design” that is on view in the entire temple which has high relief carvings of the figurines. Finely chiselled, the decorative quality of the ornamentation with the sharp inscribed lines has “strong angular forms and brilliant dark-light patterns”. The carvings are of circles, undulations giving off spirals or sprays, geometric patterns, masks of lions and other uniform designs which has created a pleasant picture that is unique to this temple, among all others in the complex.
The main temple tower with 84 mini spiresErotic sculptures on the external walls of the templeIn the interior space from the entrance there are three mandapas or halls, which successively rise in height and width, which is inclusive of a small chamber dedicated to Shiva, a chamber where Shiva’s wife, Parvati is deified, and a central sanctum or garbhagriha (literal meaning “womb chamber”) where the Shiva linga, the phallic emblem of Shiva is deified. The sanctum sanctorum is surrounded by interlinked passages which also have side and front balconies. Due to inadequate natural light in the balconies the sanctum has very little light thus creating a “cave like atmosphere” which is in total contrast to the external parts of the temple. In the interior halls of the temple and on its exterior faces there are elaborately carved sculptures of gods and goddesses, musicians and apsaras or nymphs. 
The huge pillars of the halls have architectural features of the “vine or scroll motif”. In the corners of the halls, there are insets which are carved on the surface with incised patterns. There is a main tower above the sanctum and there are two other towers above the other mantapas also in the shape of “semi-rounded, stepped, pyramidal form with progressively greater height”. The main tower is encircled by a series of interlinked towers and spires of smaller size. These are in the form of a repeated subset of miniature spires that abut a central core which gives the temple an unevenly cut contour similar to the shape of a mountain range of mount Kailasa of the Himalayas where the god Shiva resides, which is appropriate to the theme of the temples here.
The exterior surfaces of the temples are entirely covered with sculptures in three vertical layers.Here, there are horizontal ribbons carved with images, which shine bright in the sun light, providing rhythmic architectural features. Among the images of gods and heavenly beings, Agni, the god of fire is prominent.They are niches where erotic sculptures are fitted all round which are a major attraction among visitors. Some of these erotic sculptures are very finely carved and are in mithuna (coitus) postures with maidens flanking the couple, which is a frequently noted motif. 
There is also a “male figure suspended upside” in coitus posture, a kind of yogic pose, down on his head. The niches also have sculptures of Saptamatrikas, the septad of mother goddesses along with the gods Ganesha and Virabhadra. The seven fearful protector goddesses include Brahmi seated on a swan of Brahma; Maheshwari with three eyes seated on Shiva’s bull Nandi; Kumari; Vaishnavi mounted on Garuda; the boar-headed Varahi; the lion-headed Narasimhi and Chamunda, the slayer of demons Chanda and Munda. The image of Sardula, a mythical creature with a lion face and human limbs in the lower panel is a unique figure seen in the temple.[
Khajuraho was once the capital of the Chandela dynasty. The Kandariya Mahadeva Temple, one of the best examples of temples preserved from the medieval period in India,is the largest of the western group of temples in the Khajuraho complex which was built by the Chandela rulers. Shiva is the chief deity in the temple deified in the sanctum sanctorum.
The Kandariya Mahadeva temple was built during the reign of Vidyadhara (r. c. 1003-1035 CE). At various periods of the reign of this dynasty many famous temples dedicated to Vishnu, Shiva, Surya, Shakti of the Hindu religion and also for the Thirthankaras of Jain religion were built. Vidhyadhara, also known as Bida in the recordings of the Muslim historian Ibn-al-Athir was a powerful ruler who fought Mahmud of Ghazni in the first offensive launched by the latter in 1019. This battle was not conclusive and Mahmud had to return to Ghazni. Mahmud again waged war against Vidhyadhara in 1022. He attacked the fort of Kalinjar.[1] The siege of the fort was unsuccessful. It was lifted and Mahmud and Vidhyadhara called a truce and parted by exchanging gifts. Vidhyadhara celebrated his success over Mahmud and other rulers by building the Kaṇḍāriyā Mahādeva Temple, dedicated to his family deity Shiva. Epigraphic inscriptions on a pilaster of the mandapa in the temple mentions the name of the builder of the temple as Virimda, which is interpreted as the pseudonym of Vidhyadhara.Its construction is dated to the period from 1025 and 1050 AD.
All the extant temples including the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple were inscribed in 1986 under the UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites under Criterion III for its artistic creation and under Criterion V for the culture of the Chandelas that was popular till the country was invaded by Muslims in 1202.
Kaṇḍāriyā Mahādeva Temple is located in the Chhatarpur district of Madhya Pradesh in Central India.It is in the Khajuraho village, and the temple complex is spread over an area of 6 square kilometres (2.3 sq mi).It is in the western part of the village to the west of the Vishnu temple.
The temple complex, in the Khajuraho village at an elevation of 282 metres (925 ft), is well connected by road, rail and air services. Khajuraho is 55 kilometres (34 mi) to the south of Mahoba, 47 kilometres (29 mi) away from the Chhatarpur city to its east, 43 kilometres (27 mi) away from Panna, 175 kilometres (109 mi) by road away from Jhansi on the north, and 600 kilometres (370 mi) to the south – east of Delhi. It is 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) from the railway station. Khajuraho is served by Khajuraho Airport (IATA Code: HJR), with services to Delhi, Agra and Mumbai. It is 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) from the temple.

https://www.bharattemples.com/omkareshwar-jyotirlinga-khandwa-madhya-pradesh/,"Omkareshwar Jyotirlinga, Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh
Omkareshwar (IAST: Ōṃkārēśvar) is a Hindu temple dedicated to God Shiva. It is one of the 12 revered Jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva.It is on an island called Mandhata or Shivapuri in the Narmada river; the shape of the island is said to be like the Hindu ॐsymbol.
There are two main temples of Lord Shiva here, one to Omkareshwar (whose name means “Lord of Omkaara or the Lord of the OmSound”) located in the island and one to Amareshwar (whose name means “Immortal lord” or “lord of the Immortals or Devas”) located on the south bank of Narmada River on the mainland. As per the sloka on dwadash jyotirligam, Mamleshwar the other name of Amareshwar is the jyotirling, nonetheless, many consider both Omkareshwar and Mamleshwar equally sacred and representative of jyotirling at this sacred place.
As per Shiv Mahapuran, once Brahma (the Hindu God of creation) and Vishnu (the Hindu God of Protection and Care) had an argument in terms of supremacy of creation.[2] To test them, Shiva pierced the three worlds as a huge endless pillar of light, the jyotirlinga. Vishnu and Brahma split their ways to downwards and upwards respectively to find the end of the light in either directions. Brahma lied that he found out the end, while Vishnu conceded his defeat. Shiva appeared as a second pillar of light and cursed Brahma that he would have no place in ceremonies while Vishnu would be worshipped until the end of eternity. The jyotirlinga is the supreme partless reality, out of which Shiva partly appears. The jyothirlinga shrines, thus are places where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light.Originally there were believed to be 64 jyothirlingas while 12 of them are considered to be very auspicious and holy. Each of the twelve jyothirlinga sites take the name of the presiding deity – each considered different manifestation of Shiva.At all these sites, the primary image is lingam representing the beginningless and endless Stambha pillar, symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva.
The twelve jyothirlingas are Somnath in Gujarat, Mallikarjuna at Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh, Mahakaleswar at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, Omkareshwar in Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh, Kedarnath in Himalayas, in Uttrakhandstate, Bhimashankar in Maharashtra, Viswanath at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Triambakeshwar neNashik in Maharashtra, Vaidyanath Jyotirlinga, Deogarhin Jharkhand  Nageswar at Dwarka in Gujarat, Rameshwar at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Grishneshwar near Aurangabad, Maharashtra in Maharashtra.[
As per Hindu legend, Vindya, the deity controlling the Vindyachal mountain range was worshipping Shiva to propitiate himself from the sins committed. He created a sacred geometrical diagram and a Lingam made of sand and clay. Shiva was pleased with the worhip and believed to have appeared in two forms, namely Omkareshwar and Amaleswara. Since the mud mound appeared in the form of Om, the island came to be known as Omkareswar. There is a shrine for Parvati and five-faced Ganapati in the temple.[10]
The second story relates to Mandhata and his son’s penance. King Mandhata of Ikshvaku clan (an ancestor of Lord Ram) worshipped Lord Shiva here until the Lord manifested himself as a Jyotirlinga. Some scholars also narrate the story about Mandhata’s sons-Ambarish and Muchukunda, who had practiced severe penance and austerities here and pleased Lord Shiva. Because of this the mountain is named Mandhata.
The third story from Hindu scriptures says that once upon a time there was a great war between Devas and Danavas(demon), in which Danavas won. This was a major setback for Devas and hence Devas prayed to Lord Shiva. Pleased with their prayer, Lord Shiva emerged in the form of Omkareshwar Jyotirlinga and defeated Danavas.
Adi Shankara’s Cave – Omkareshwar is said to be the place where Sri Adi Sankara met his Guru Govindapada in a cave. This cave can be found even today just below the Shiva temple where an image of Adi Shankara has been installed
It is situated in the Khandwa district of Madhya Pradesh state in India. It is about 12 miles (20 km) from Mortakka in Madhya Pradesh. Omkareshwar is formed by the sacred river Narmada. This is one of the most sacred of rivers in India and is now home to one of the world’s biggest dam projects. The temple is situated on Mandatha island on the banks of Narmada and river Kaveri (a tributary of Narmada). The island is 2.6 km2 (2,600,000 m2) in area and can be approached by boats.

Mythological stories and legends in reference to pilgrimage sites –
There is a very ancient mythological story behind the origin of this temple, according to which the daughter of Emperor Dakha wanted to marry Sati, Lord Shiva, but the king considered Shiva as a companion of Lord Shiva and ghosts and emperors and was against the marriage. However, Sati married the lord Shiva against his father’s wishes. According to the story, once King Daksh created a yagya called ‘Jupiter Sarva’, in this yajna, Brahma, Vishnu, Indra and other gods and goddesses were also invited, but deliberately they did not call Lord Mahadev. Sati, daughter of Mahadev’s wife and Daksh, was very unhappy with this and at the altar of sacrifice, Sati asked the reason for not inviting Lord Shiva from her father, Daksh had said a word about Lord Shiva, then suffering from this humiliation Sati sat silent and turned to the north direction and took his meditation at the feet of Lord Shiva, by holding the air and fire element through Yoga route, consume your body with its own strength. Or, when Shiva revealed the accident angry opened his third eye and destroyed the sacrifice. Then Lord Shankar lifted the body of Mother Sati on the shoulder and began to meditate in anger.
For the good of the universe, Lord Vishnu divided the body of Sati into fifty-two parts. Wherever the body and the ornament of Sati’s body fell, Shakti Peethas were formed. One of them is Shakti Peeth, the temple of Mihara Devi, where mother Sati’s necklace fell. Meher means the mother’s necklace, hence the name of this place was maihar. In the next life, Sati was born in the form of Parvati, the house of Himachal, and after receiving austerity, Shiva was again found as a husband. Another interesting legend about this shrine is also prevalent. Explains that 200 years ago Maharaj Durgjan Singh used to rule the name of Judeo. A shepherd from his kingdom used to come to the forest to feed cow. In this horrible forest, the day was dark as night. There were many types of scary sounds used to come.
One day he noticed that a golden cow came along from those cows and came to the place suddenly after the evening. On the second day, when the cowboy brought the cows on this hill, then it was seen that the same cow was being eaten together with these cows. Then he decided that when this cow would return to the evening, that would be followed by that too. Chasing the cow, he saw that he went into the cave situated in the top of the hill and when the inside of the cave closed it closed. She sat there at the door He does not know how long after the door is open. But there he appeared to an old mother. Then the shepherd said to the old lady, ‘Mai, I feed your cow, so give me something for the stomach.
I have come to you from this very desire. ‘The old mother went in and gave barley grains in a wooden soup to the shepherd, and said,’ Now you do not come alone in this forest. ‘ Cow is pasting in the forest, but you live alone in this forest? You do not feel scared. ‘Then the old mother laughed with that shepherd and said,’ Son, this forest, high mountain-mountain is my home, I reside in this house. By saying so, he disappeared. When the shepherd came home and opened a barley granite, he was surprised. The diamond-pearl was shining in the place of barley. He thought – I will do it. In the morning, I will be present in the king’s court and will tell you the past. On the second day, the shepherd reached his court with his plea and narrated the whole antagonist in front of the king. Upon hearing the story of that shepherd, King went to sleep in his palace, asking to go there the next day. In the night, the king was seen by the shepherd in a dream and the old mother appeared and realized that this is Shakti Maa Sharda.
In the dream, the mother ordered the Maharaja to set up an idol there and said that my vision will be fulfilled only by all the people’s desires. In the morning, the king did all the work as per his mother’s orders. Soon the glory of this place started spreading around The devotees started coming from the other side for the blessings of the mother and their wishful desires began to be fulfilled. After this, the devotees of Mata made a huge temple of Mother Sharda. Another legend is also prevalent in reference to this religious site. According to tradition, two brave brothers, Alha and Udal who fought with Prithviraj Chauhan, used to be Shadha Mata’s devotees. These two people first discovered this temple of Sharda Devi between the forests. After this, Alha pleased Goddess by doing penance for twelve years in this temple.

Orchha (or Urchha) is a town in Tikamgarh district of Madhya Pradesh state, India. The town was established by Rudra Pratap Singh some time after 1501, as the seat of an eponymous former princely state of central India, in the Bundelkhand region.Orchha lies on the Betwa River, 80 km from Tikamgarh & 15 km from Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh.
Orchha is one of the few places in India that combines natural beauty, the aesthetic legacy of history and a certain authenticity. Orchha is in transition from village to town and many of its smaller temples throne over well-tended fields. It’s a paradise for bird watchers with a wide variety of colourful birds often making an appearance. Life in Orchha revolves around the Ram temple where one can see how vibrant Hinduism remains today.
Orchha’s rapid development brings with it the chaos rooted in the lack of urban planning that is typical of India… inadequate roads, non-existent or choked drains and fast accumulating piles of waste. Being a small town of about 10,000 inhabitants, these problems are not insurmountable but require a strong dose of good governance and transparency in the use of public money. That is why the strengthening of local democracy is so important.
So is the empowerment of the women of Orchha who remain constrained by traditional attitudes concerning their roles and capabilities. Meeting women from other cultures has made them aspire to more independence for their daughters.
Orchha was founded in 1531 (the 16th century AD)by the Bundela Rajput chief, Rudra Pratap Singh,who became the first King of Orchha, (r. 1501-1531) and also built the Fort of Orchha.The Chaturbhuj Temple was built during the reign of EmperorAkbar, by the Queen of Orchha Ganesh Kunwar (गणेश कुँवर),while Raj Mandir was built by ‘Madhukar Shah’ during his reign, 1554 to 1591.

https://www.bharattemples.com/shri-kshetra-jwala-narsinha-teerth-kole-narsinhapur/,"Jwala Narasimha, Kole Narasinghpur (Maharashtra, India) – one of the ancient self-manifested idols of shaligrama Shila Narsimha. The place has the same importance as Multan (Pakistan). This is the biggest Shaligram idol in the world.
Lord Narsimha idol in Kole Narsimhapur is made of shaligram. It is a self-manifested form of the Lord. As seen, the appearance of the lord is enormously impressive and a pleasure to the eyes. In this murti, one can see the lord with 16 arms, holding the demon Hirankyakashapu tight in it.
Known to the locals as “Jwala [flaming] Narasimha”, this impressive sixteen-handed form of the Lord standing on one foot has been the protector and benefactor of his reverential devotees for thousands of years. The local tradition related to this deity has been compiled in a book known as Krishna-mahatmya. A verse reads as follows:
यदा पुनस्तदा भक्त्या तपः कर्तुं पराशरः |नारसिंहं तदा ध्यायन् कृष्णा तीरे मुनीश्वरः ||
”The foremost amongst the sages, Parashar, performed austerities on the bank of the river Krishna with a heart full of devotion, meditating on Lord Narasimhadev.”
This Idol of Narasimha Lord at Kole Narsimhapur has sharply carved shapes of the various avtaars of Lord Vishnu. On the left bottom of the Lord one can see forms of Bhakt Pralhada and beside him Goddess Mahalaksmi, while on His right is Goddess Bhudevi and Garuda the vehicle of Lord Vishnu. One can see various ornaments like the “Bajubandh” on his arm and rings which make Him more beautiful . The beauty of the Murti is beyond description. We have to take a darshan and experience the aroma of this form of Lord Narasimha and feel blessed . All around the form of Lord Narasimha were wonderful carvings of the famous dashavataras, ten incarnations of Lord Krishna.
According to the local tradition, Lord Narasimhadev was pleased with the devotion of Parashar Muni and hence appeared in a wonderful sixteen-handed form. This was the same blazing form that the Lord had assumed while killing Hiranyakashipu.
Seeing that it was not possible for anyone to establish this ferociously blazing form on earth, the Lord ordered Parashar Muni to immerse him in the river Krishna. With a heavy heart, the sage immersed the deity in the water.
Centuries later, around the year 178 A.D., a brahmin couple staying at a village named Anjana had been cursed to become blind and dumb by a sage. On begging forgiveness, they were advised by the sage to perform austerities for the pleasure of Lord Narasimha to absolve themselves of the curse. After twelve years of rigorous austerities, the Lord appeared in their dreams and told them that he now wished to establish himself on earth as a deity and asked them to approach the local king named Bhimadev to get him out of the river. When asked how they would find the exact location where he was under the water, the Lord told them to place some dry kusha grass in the stream and that they would find him exactly under the place where the grass caught fire. After having darshana of the Lord in the dream, the couple immediately regained their sight and speech and set off to inform the king.
On hearing the request of the couple, the king sent his entourage to discover the deity. While searching in the river according to the procedure specified by the Lord, one of the blades of grass caught fire and the wonderful sixteen-handed form of the Lord was discovered from the depths of the river.
On examining the deity, the devotees could see that the Lord was positioned with his left leg raised and bent in order to place the demon Hiranyakashipu upon it, and also to hold the left arm of the demon to prevent him from escaping. His other foot was placed firmly on the doorstep of Hiranyakashipu.
The temple has two main doors — one on the northern side and another on the eastern side. Visitors generally enter through the eastern door. The deity is located 14 feet under the ground, and in order to reach there, one has to climb down steep staircases and pass through narrow tunnels many of which are under several inches of flowing water from the nearby Krishna River. The temple complex contains a painting and samädhi of a Siddha- mahätma named Sri Siddheshwar Maharaja.

According to legend, once the area was a place haunted by an evil demon named Jalandar who was an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva. Even though the demon was wild and practiced evil deeds, he had a pious and virtuous wife Vrinda Devi. Lord Shiva was highly impressed by his devotion and he blessed the demon with a boon of immortality. This boon made Jalandar to create destruction in the area.
The Gods realized the importance to kill the demon to save the mankind. The Gods approached Lord Vishnu to help them in this noble cause. Lord Vishnu understood that the chastity and piousness of Jalandar’s wife is acting as a shield to his life. Lord Vishnu adopted the look of Jalandar and started living with his wife. He challenged the chastity of the women and killed Jalandar. When Jalandar’s wife Devi Vrinda came to know this, she cursed Lord Vishnu to turn black and ugly. The curse of the lady made him dark and he had to take a holy dip in River Godavari to regain his original form. After regaining his original form, Lord Vishnu was called Sundarnarayan.

The temple is dedicated to Khandoba, also known as Mhalsakant or Malhari Martand or Mylaralinga. Khandoba is regarded as the ‘God of Jejuri’ and is held in great reverence by the Dhangars.
The town is known for being the venue of one of the revered temples in the state, known as the Khandobachi Jejuri.
Khandoba is the prime deity of farming, shepherd, hunter, tribal, warrior, lingayat and some Brahmin communities. It is a strong belief that Khandoba married women from different communities to indicate the equality of various castes and communities. Khandoba’s fourth wife is said to be a gardener whereas his fifth wife was from oil presser caste. Though Khandoba is not a major deity of Brahmin communities, he is the Kuldevata (family deity) of some Deshastha Brahmin families.
Jejuri is a city and a municipal council in the Pune district in the Indian state of Maharashtra. It is famous for the main temple of Lord Khandoba. It is a famous temple town being the family deity of many houses in Maharashtra and Karnataka. Its economy is centred on businesses catering to the numerous devotees coming to worship the Khandoba Temple there. Recently the increase in property rates and the planning of an international airport near the town has seen a spurt of development happening there.
Rituals Related to Khandoba Vaghya is a cult where boys wear a traditional costume and dance in the temple premise. Earlier, there was also a ‘Devadasi system’ where women courtesans called Murali were married to the Lord. Later, this system was abolished. Vegetarian dishes like Puran Poli and Bharit Rodga is given as a religious offering to the God. Goat flesh is offered outside the temple eventhough Khandoba is described as non-vegetarian. Six-day festival in the month of Margashira, Dasara and Chaitra Purnima are the famous festivals celebrated in Khandoba Temple. It is really interesting to visit this hill top temple at Jejuri in Maharashtra.
Jejuri Khandoba Temple can be easily divided into two separate sections – the Mandap and Garbhagriha.
In many oral traditions and other literary works, Khandoba is described to be a tribal king and a womaniser. However, some descriptions are derived from Oleographic evidences (kind of block paintings) which are similar to the concept of Shiva, Parvathi and Ganga! Some important paintings indicate to two women in Khandobas life. His first wife is Mhalsa and second wife is Bani or Banubai. The tales say that Mhalsa was not happy with Khadoba’s second marriage to Bani and they fought often over this issue. Many oral traditions also have songs describing their fight!
So, Khandoba is said to have given the upper portion of the hill to his wife Mhalsa and gave the bottom of the hill to Bani. Interestingly, the temple of Bani is located at the foot of the hill. Sanskrit texts connect the trio of Khandoba, Mhalsa and Bani to Lord Shiva, Parvathi and Ganga. However, the folklore suggests that Khandoba was a womaniser, he had five wives and many concubines.
The temple was the site of a historic treaty between Tarabai and Balaji Bajirao on 14 September 1752
Jejuri is around 50km from Pune. It is well-connected to other parts of the state. Visitors can take government-run buses from Pune or hire private cabs to reach Jejuri.

In case Tripurasara forgot his vow, the Lord would be entitled to sue him in any way he deemed suitable.
As time went on, Tripurasara forgot all about his vow and began harassing the local folk as well as other deities. Chaos reigned and the deities approached the Lord to help them.
The Lord prayed to Goddess Parvati to help him. Together, in the form of “ardh-narya-nateshwar”, on the eve of Kartik Poornima, they killed Tripurasara and the day is now known as Tripurasara Poornima.

On this occasion Ras Lila was performed for five days at Raas Mandal Pukhri at Langthabal

The Hindu saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1534), who was instrumental in establishing the Chaitnaya Math and propagated Vaishnavism (worship of Vishnu and related deities) visited this temple, on his way from Puri in 1510. The temple was refurbished by Raghoji I Bhonsle (reign: 1739-1755), the Maratha ruler of the Nagpur kingdom. It is a protected monument maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India
The festivals held in the temple complex are the Chandana Yatra, Sunia, Kartika Purnima, Baula Amavasya, Maha Varuni Yatra, Mahashivaratri, and so forth.
The temple faces east and is located in a 30-by-40-metre (98 by 131 ft) plot. The temple structure is built over a plinth of 25.30-by-12-metre (83.0 by 39.4 ft). The height of the temple is 22 metres (72 ft). Built in Kalinga architectural style, the temple has three components, namely the vimana (building containing the sanctum), the antarala (a small chamber between the sanctum and the hall) and the jagamohana (assembly hall).  
 The vimana is a Rekha deula (a tall building with a shape of sugar loaf) and the jagamohana is a pidha deula (square building with a pyramid-shaped roof). The Vimana as well as the jagamohana are square in shape. The temple is built in ashlar masonry with Khandolite stone, the exposed surfaces are plastered and given a white wash of lime. The outer wall is panchanga bada, that is, divided into 5 parts (from base to top): pabhaga, talajangha, bandhana, upara jangha and baranda.
The sanctum has two images of Varaha, a Lakshmi (consort of Vishnu) image and a Jagannath (a regional form of Vishnu) image. The Jagannath image is made of wood, while the rest are made of chlorite.

When Brahma was performing Ashvamedha yajna, he realised that the Vedas were stolen, he then requested Lord Vishnu to retrieve them. As soon as the yajna was completed, Lord Vishnu emerged from the yagna in the form of a boar – His Varaha avatar – with the stolen scriptures. Since then, the location of the yajna came to be known as Jajpur. This 15-16th century temple is located at the banks of Vaitarani River on an island formed by the river. This ancient Varaha temple once had 4 deities – while 3 deities of Varaha are still here (Yajna Varaha, Vishnu Varaha and Adi Varaha). The fourth Deity named as Lakshmi Varaha was taken by King of Aul across Vaitarani to Kendrapara, Orissa.

The village contains the Leaning temple dedicated to Lord Siva, which was built in the reign of Baliar Singh, the fifth Raja of Sambalpur. The worship of Siva is said to have been initiated by a milkman(Gauda), who daily crossed the Mahanadi to a place on the bank where the underlying rock croped out. Here he daily offered his dole of milk, which was at once drunk up by the rock, and this miraculous circumstance led to enquiries, which ended in the construction of the present temple.

A great fair takes place at the foothill in March every year on the occasion of Sivratri. The presiding diety is Bimaleswar Siva. The special type of fish found here are called as Kudo fish.

About the inclination, its not possible to judge whether the angle is in a increasing trend or not. For that some sort of measurement mechanism should be given to analyse it very correctly as it is done in leaning tower of Pissa.

The temple dates back to 950–975 CE and is a monument of importance in the study of the development of Hindu temples in Odisha.

https://www.bharattemples.com/varahi-deula-chaurasi-puri-odisha/,"Varahi Deula, Chaurasi, puri, odisha
Varahi Deula is an ancient 9th century built temple situated on the eastern coast of Odisha in Puri district. The Varahi temple of Chaurasi is unique in more than one way. The image enshrined in this temple is considered to be one of the masterpieces among the images of the deity found all over India.
Viewed from architectural point, the temple of Varahi in Chaurasi is the most beautiful monument in the Prachi Valley. This temple marks a significant deviation from the usual tradition of Rekha and the Bhadra type and exhibits a novel style which according to Orissan nomenclature is of Khakhara or Gaurichara variety. The ground plan of it somewhat resembles that of the Baitala Deula in Bhubaneswar, but while the plan of the latter admits of no regular ratha protection, this temple presents a pancharatha type both in plan and construction.4 The Vimana is rectangular in cross section and with its elongated vaulted roof and other architectural features it resembles more with the Gauri temple of Bhubaneswar than with the Vaital temple. The vase of the Vimana measures 18 ft by 22 ft and height of it is 27 ft. The Jagamohana which is also rectangular in shape like that of the Parsuramesvara is a pidha temple with seven distinct tires of pidhas. The walls of both the Vimana and Mohana are beautifully decorated with the figural and arabesque motifs and maintain a high order of balance and rhythm.
The noteworthy reliefs are found on a single board that surrounds the whole jagamohana just below the baranda where scenes from Ramayana such as killing of the illusory deer, the abduction of Sita, the murder of Jatayu, the uprooting of seven palm trees, the murder of Vali, the construction of the bridge over the sea are depicted with grace and precision. The majestic moulding, designs and carvings of the entire temple are found in remarkable varieties and profusion not being overdone and accentuated the singular beauty and richness of the monuments in a manner that was hitherto unknown in the Prachi Valley.
The main temple is like the Khakhara style belonging to Kalinga Kingdom architecture. Other such example is Vaital Deula, in Bhubaneshwar.
Spreading over about 2 acres of land, this shrine is Shakta and the presiding deity of the temple is Goddess Varahi, locally called as Matsya Varahi. She sits in lalitasana on a cushion placed on a plain platform with her right foot resting on the buffalo mount carved on the pedestal. She is presented as the pot-bellied goddess with the face of a boar. She has two arms and holds a fish in her right hand and a bowl in her left hand. A third eye is tightly engraved into her forehead. Here Barahi is worshipped in accordance with the tantric rituals. Goddess Varahi is offered fish every day.
The semicylindrical shape of the temple shows the variation from the medieval temples of Odisha. Daily the Mahaprasad of Lord Jagannath comes to this temple.
This temple was built in honour of Varahi in the first quarter of 10th century A.D. during Somavamsi rule. The temple is east facing and built with Sand stone. The area dimension (L x B x H) of the temple is 15.84 m x 8.23 m x 8.40 m.
Varahi is believed to be the Sakti of Varaha. In the Tantric text ‘Varahi Tantra’ mention has been made of five forms of Varahi i.e., Svapna Varahi, Canda Varahi, Mahi Varahi (Bhairavi), Kruccha Varahi and Matsya Varahi. The description of Matsya Varahi closely corresponds to the image enshrined in the temple.
She has two arms and she is shown seated in lalitasana on a pedestal. Following the iconographic canons, the image bears the face of a boar and body of a divine woman. Her right hand holds a fish while the left hand holds a kapala. She has kept her right foot on her vahana (vehicle) buffalo which is seated on the pedestal at the bottom. Varahi is represented with a third eye on her forehead which is not clearly visible at present. Her hair is decorated in the form of spiral coils.
The beauty of this image lies in her big belly to indicate her as holding the universe in her womb. On the back slab two vidyadharas are represented each on either side. In addition to the main deity in the sanctum two more images of Varahi which are smaller than the main image are placed in the Jagamohana. Both of them are seated in ardhaparyankasana. Among them the image in the right niche is shown with a fish in her right hand and a kapala in her left hand. At the bottom a figure of naravahana is placed on the pedestal. The four-armed Varahi in the left niche holds a kapala in the lower left hand and is shown with Varada mudra in the corresponding right hand. The upper right hand holds a fish and left hand holds a rosary.
Varahi temple of Satabhaya (Cuttack) Banchua (Keonjhar district), Narendrapur (Balasore district) are the other places in the state where she is worshipped. Images of Varahi have also been found from Puri, Jajpur, Dharmasala Ayodhya, Danagandar, Kisenpur, Tarapur, Padagadi, Kantilo, Garudapancana, Bayalishbati, Chatesvar, Bhubaneshwar, Pallur Kanchipuram.
Chaurasi is situated between Nimapada-Kakatpur road and is at a distance of 30 kilometers from Konark and 14 kilometers from Kakatpur village with easy transport available from Puri and Konark. The easiest way to reach the temple is to drive 29 km to Charichhaka, take a right turn and drive 3 km to Amareshwar village and then take a left turn and drive 1.8 km.

Baitāḷa deuḷa or Vaitāḷa deuḷa  is an 8th-century Hindu temple of typical Khakara style dedicated to Goddess Chamunda located in Bhubaneswar, the capital city of Orissa, India. It is also locally known as Tini-mundia deula due to the three spires on top of it, a very distinct and unusual feature. The three spires are believed to represent the three powers of the goddess Chamunda – Mahasaraswati, Mahalakshmi and Mahakali.
Baitaḷa Deuḷa Temple’s striking feature is the shape of its sanctuary tower. The semi-cylindrical shape of its roof is a leading example of Khakhara order of temples— which bears an affinity to the Dravidian Gopuram of the South Indian temples. Its gabled towers with a row of Shikharas reveals unmistakable signs of southern intrusion.The plan of the deuḷa is oblong and the jagamohana is a rectangular structure, but embedded in each angle is a small subsidiary shrine. Baitala deuḷa boasts of some figures, although executed in relief, are however characterized by delicacy of features and perfect equipoise.
The outer walls are encrusted with panels of Hindu deities, mostly Shiva and his consort Parvati in her Shakti form, hunting processions, capturing of wild elephants and the occasional erotic couples.
The facade of the deuḷa above the left of the jagamohana is dominated by two chaitya windows—the lower one having a beautifully carved figure of Surya the Sun God noted for its facial expression, with Usha (Dawn) and Pratyusha shooting arrows on either side and with Aruna in front, driving a chariot of seven horses.
The medallion in the upper Chaitya window houses a 10-armed Nataraja or dancing Shiva. In front of the flat roofed Jagamohana is a stone post relieved with two Buddha like figures seated in Dharma-Chakra-Pravartana mudra.
Another striking feature is temple’s Tantric associations, marked by eerie carvings in the sanctum and the image enshrined in the central niche, eight armed Chamunda, locally known as Kapaḷini, is the terrifying form of goddess Durga. Thus, Baitāḷa Deuḷa is a Shakti shrine.

Upper Bagh Devi Temple is well connected with different modes of transport. The nearest railway station is located at Berhampur at a distance of 88 kms.
According to a legend there were three sisters, Bada Raula, Upper Bagh Devi and Bagh Devi. Bada Raula was the eldest among the sisters while Bagh Devi was the youngest. It is said that the three fought among themselves for coconut. One day they decided to divide the region into three parts. They threw three pots in different directions. One of them got fixed at a spot where the Bada Raula temple is located, the second pot got stuck in another location where the Upper Bagh Devi Temple has been constructed but the third pot descended into a pond. Later a notable poet Upendra Bhanja was instructed in his dream by the Devi to build temples in the three locations. He followed the instructions and gradually built temples for Bada Raula and Upper Bagh Devi. However, the temple for Bagh Devi could not be constructed.
The presiding deity of the temple is Goddess Bagh Devi. This hilltop temple is accessed by 285 (approx) steps. Another shrine of Goddess Bagh Devi has been built at the foot of the hill.
Its people’s believe that there were three sisters (including Upper Bagh Devi). One is more upper of current Upper Bagh Devi Temple is also called as Bada Raula (may be means big sister) and there is another temple simply called as Bagh Devi (youngest sister) near to Jagannath Temple. People say that these three sisters always fought each other for Coconut and then once decided that they can divide the region who will stay where. So they throw three Lotta (type of rounded drinking container widely used in Orissa for drinking water). One stuck in the same place where Bada Raula is staying currently, second one stuck in the place where today called as Upper Bagh Devi and the third one was fallen into a Pond which currently a temple which is below the ground level. Then Kavi Samrat Upendra Bhanja got indication from devi (through dream) that he may need to build temple in these places. Gradually the temple were built and renovated but the Bada Raula’s Temple was never built since it is very difficult to go there as there is no steps to go there till now.

The Leaning Temple of Huma in India is one of only two leaning temples in the world.It is located in Huma, a village situated on the bank of the Mahanadi, 23 km south of Sambalpur in the Indian state of Orissa. The temple is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva.
It is not known if this structure is leaning by design or from another reason. While the edifice leans, the pinnacle of the temple is perpendicular to the ground.
Apart from the main temple the Bhairavi Devi temple is situated to the left of the main temple and Bhairo temple is situated to the right of the main temple. According to historical records Ganga Vamsi Emperor Anangabhima Deva-III built this temple. The temple was rebuilt or renovated by King Baliar Singh (1660–1690 A.D.), the fifth Chauhan king of Sambalpur. The rest of the temples were built during the rule of King Ajit Singh (1766–1788 A.D.) of Sambalpur.
The temple is positioned on the rocky cradle just on the bank of the river Mahanadi. The basis of leaning cannot be assumed to be the technical flaws at the time of construction. It is also not easily acceptable that weak foundation might have caused leaning attitude of the temple. There may have been interior displacement of the rocky bed on which it stands, either due to flood currents in the river Mahanadi or earthquakes, thus affecting the straight posture of the original temple.
In other words, the plinth of the temple has deviated slightly from its original arrangement and as a result, the body of the temple has tilted. There is no denying the fact that this has fascinated the attention of historians, sculptors and other researchers. The surprising thing is, the main temple is tilted to one direction and other small temples are tilted to some other directions. Within the temple complex i.e. within the boundaries of temple, everything found to be in tilted condition including the boundaries and the angle of inclination is not changed since last 40/50 years as said by the villagers and priests. The reason of the tilt can be due to some geological reason, may be the earth crust is uneven in structure. The angle of inclination is yet to be measured.
The worship of Shiva is said to have been initiated by a milkman, who crossed the Mahanadi daily to a place on the bank where the underlying rock cropped out. Here he offered his dole of milk, which was immediately consumed by the rock. This miraculous circumstance led to inquiries, which ended in the construction of the present temple.

It is said that a poor young man of the village, later named it as Sakhigopala, fell in love with the daughter of the village headman.

The villagers, including the headman and the young man, went on a pilgrimage to Kashi. The village headman fell ill and was abandoned by fellow villagers. The young man tended to him so well that he soon got well and, in gratitude, promised his daughter in marriage to the young man. As soon as they returned to the village, the headman went back on his promise, asking the young man to produce a witness in support of his claim.
Lord Gopala, impressed by the young man’s devotion, agreed to come and bear witness to the promise on one condition: that the young man lead the way and he would follow, but the young man must never look back. He led the way to the village, passing a mound of sand. As they passed, the man could not hear the Lord’s footsteps and turned back. Immediately the Lord turned into a statue of stone rooted to the spot. The villagers were still so impressed that God himself came to back the young man’s claim that the youngsters were married off; they were later appointed as the first priests of the temple built in Lord Gopala’s honour who came to bear witness

The temple is reachable by road from Jagatsinghpur, Cuttack and Paradeep. Bhubaneshwar is approximately 80 km from Jagatshingpur, and it is well connected by road. The nearest railway station is Cuttack; though, there is a small Passenger Halt at Sarala Road, which is near Tentulipada. Maa Saarala is a Hindu goddess.
As per historical clue, it is believed that this famous temple of Sarala Chandi was built in Sarola Grama in 8th Century. The Goddess “Maa Sarala” was being worshiped in this temple till the end of Hindu rule in 1568 A.D. History and literature remained as the witness to the existence of Sarola Chandi in the Sarola grama (village). In this situation one among the great verses of Oriya Mahabharat may be quoted here.
The Maa Sarala Temple is a Hindu temple in the district of Jagatsinghpur, Odisha, India. The temple is accessible by road from Jagatsinghpur, Cuttack and Paradeep. The nearest airport is Bhubaneshwar, which is approximately 80 km, and is well connected by road. The nearest railway station is Cuttack; however, there is a small Passenger Halt at Sarala Road, near Tentulipada. The temple can be reached via Jagatsinghpur, or Tarapur by road, from Cuttack.
Maa Saarala is a Hindu goddess who patronizes the cultures of Vaishnav and Shakta. Rarely does one find the use of Vilva Patraand Tulasi patra in any temple, as they are symbols of two distinct divisions of Hindu culture.
There is also some controversy regarding the deity, where it is suspected that the deity may be a Buddhist tantric figure, as she holds a book, Veena and hand bell – known Mahayana symbols. It is said that Huen Tsang, the Chinese pilgrim, visited Odisha and he had taken a ship from Chilitolo Port to Sri lanka, which historians attribute to modern day Tirtol. This may be a possibility as geography shows that Paradip was an island and the land in and around Kujanga was under water – Sea/River. There is geographic evidence to support this. To be at a safer side, we may conclude that Sarala represents the Shiva-Shakti worship which evolved from an amalgamation of Shaivism (worship of Shiva), Shaktism (worship of the Mother Goddess) and/or Tantric form.
Goddess Sarala is known as Vak Devi, the Goddess of Knowledge and Wisdom. It is well documented that Sidheshwar Parida – a small-time farmer and part-time Oriya Paika – was an ardent follower of the Goddess and it was after her blessings that Sidheshwar Parida became Sarala Das, the author of the Oriya Mahabharata.
Folklore goes back to thousands of years, to the age of Parashurama. It is said that it was God Parashurama who had carved the goddess with the tip of his arrow. Even this temple survived the ravages of Kala Chand (legendary Kala Pahada). The new temple- 500 years old – was built by the Raja of Manijanga. The remnants of the old temple is not visible, but folklore goes that it was at Badasarol, a place where the Ganesha Temple, (generally adorns the south gate of all Oriya temples) (Nanda Deula, now renovated) stands as witness, where the old temple once stood.
Although there are many festivals that are celebrated in the temple, the major ones are: Parbana, Sharadiya Utsav, Pana Sankranti, Dola Purnima, Chandan Jatra. The people of the Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur and Cuttack districts are so attached to the goddess that they make it a point to visit the temple every year – at least once.
The temple is very well connected with roads network, which is accessible by road from Jagatsinghpur, Cuttack and Paradeep. At least everyday three buses are plying from Cuttack (Badambadi bus stand) to Sarala peetha.
The nearest railway station is Cuttack, however there is a small Pessenger Halt at Sarala Road, near Tentulipada. Two trains are plying daily between Cuttack and Paradeep and one can avail this facility to visit Sarala Temple.
The nearest airport is Bhubaneshwar, which is approximately 80 km, it is well connected by road.

https://www.bharattemples.com/ramachandi-temple-puri-odisha/,"Ramachandi Temple, Puri, Odisha
Ramachandi Temple, is on a beautiful spot on the banks of the Kusabhadra River where it flows into the Bay of Bengal. It is only 5 km away from Konark in the Puri District of Odisha. Goddess Ramachandi, the deity of Konark is thought by some to be the presiding deity of this temple, while others thought it to be the temple of Mayadevi, wife of Surya(Sun God).
A legend regarding the deity is popular among the locals. Kalapahad, the rebel Hindu Brahmin youth who got converted to Islam, vowed to destroy all the temples of Hindu worship during the 17th century. After destroying the Sun temple, Kalapahad approached Ramachandi temple to destroy it. Then Goddess Ramachandi dressed as a Maluni (a maid servant) asked Kalapahad to wait at the door till she brings water from the river for the Goddess. Kalapahad anxiously waited for a long time to get some cold water. When it was too late and the Maluni did not return he was exhausted and entered inside the temple and found the throne empty. Then he thought the Maluni took away the deity with her and with anger he followed the Maluni. When he reached the bank of the Kushabhadra river he found the goddess Ramachandi floating in the middle of the river. At that time the river was outpouring, so he came back without being able to reach the middle of the river. Then Goddess Ramachandi came in dream of a Panda (priest) and told him to build a temple on the bank of the Kushabhadra river. This place is now known as Ramachandi. Throughout the year many visitors come here to get the blessing of Goddess Ramachandi and to enjoy the scenic beauty of river Kushabhadra and Bay of Bengal.
Now the temple has collapsed leaving remains of its broken walls and the empty throne. There is no historical evidence to conclude about its presiding deity.
The temple of Goddess Ramachandi on the river mouth of Kushabhadra river is a splendid scenic picnic resort. It is situated 7 km before Konark on the Marine drive road from Puri to Konark. Ramachandi is popularly believed the presiding deity of Konark, and the most benevolent Chandi known. It is certainly more ancient than the Sun Temple at Konark. From the architectural point of view, the temple of Ramachandi is not important but from the religious point of view, it is one of the famous Shakti pithas of Orissa.
A graceful Chandi, seated on a Lotus flower in a small temple half hidden by sand mounds, on the river mouth of Kushabhadra and the endless Bay of Bengal stretched to eternity, and a thick growth of Casuarina plantations around is the scenic maginificence of the place. Before construction of the Marine Drive road, the place was not accessible to outside visitors. However it attracted a large number of local devotees to offer sacrifices or ‘Bali’ in the month of Ashwina.
The pleasant sight has always fascinated young lovers, students and picnickers from far and wide. However, after the construction of the Marine dive road, the place has become very easily accessible. Regular crowd of pleasure seekers both from the state, neighbouring states and distant places come here.

https://www.bharattemples.com/rajarani-temple-bhubaneswar-odisha/,"Rajarani Temple, Bhubaneswar, Odisha
Rajarani Temple is an 11th-century Hindu temple located in Bhubaneswar, the capital city of Odisha (Orissa previously), India. The temple is believed to have been known originally as Indreswara. It is locally known as a “love temple” because of the erotic carvings of women and couples in the temple. Rajarani Temple is built in the pancharatha style on a raised platform with two structures: a central shrine called the vimana (sanctum) with a bada (curvilinear spire) over its roof rising to a height of 18 m (59 ft), and a viewing hall called jagamohana with a pyramidal roof. The temple was constructed of dull red and yellow sandstone locally called “Rajarani”. There are no images inside the sanctum, and hence it is not associated with a specific sect of Hinduism but broadly classified as Saivite based on the niches.
Various historians place the original construction date between the 11th and 12th centuries, and have placed it roughly belonging to the same period as the Jagannath Temple at Puri. The architecture of other temples in central India is believed to have originated with this temple, the notable ones being the Khajuraho temples and Totesvara Mahadeo temple in Kadawa.There are various sculptures in the walls around the temple, and the vimana depicting scenes of the marriage of Shiva, Nataraja, Parvati, and include tall, slender, sophisticated nayikas in various roles and moods such as turning her head from an emaciated ascetic, fondling her child, holding a branch of tree, attending to her toilet, looking into a mirror, taking off her anklet, caressing her pet bird and playing a musical instrument. Rajarani Temple is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as a ticketed (pay to enter) monument.
The Orissan temples have two parts namely the sanctum (deul or vimana) and the other is place from where pilgrims view the sanctum (called jagamohana). The initial deul temples were without the jagamohana as seen in some of the older temples in Bhubaneswar while the later temples had two additional structures namely nata-mandapa (festival hall) and bhoga-mandapa (hall of offerings). The vimana is square in plan, and the walls are variegated by ressaults (called rathas or pagas).Amalaka (also called mastaka), a stone disk with ridges on the rim, is placed over the bada (tower) of the temple. Rajarani Temple stands on a raised platform. The temple was constructed of dull red and yellow sandstone locally called “Rajarani”.
It is pancharatha in plan with a curvilinear superstructure (rekha shikhara) 18m(55 ft) tall. The vimana (tower) is surrounded by a cluster of miniature towers with double crowning elements and appears round, unlike other temples in Bhubaneswar but like the towers of Khajuraho temples. The temple stands on a plinth with three mouldings. The bada consists of five divisions instead of the three divisions usually found in other temples. The vimanarises to a height of 17.98 metres (59.0 ft) from the basement.The vimana (sanctum) measures 10.25 ft (3.12 m)*10.25 ft (3.12 m) from the inside, 31 ft (9.4 m)*29 ft (8.8 m) from the outside.[10] Its spire is decorated with clusters of turrets (replication of the spire itself) emerging from the rib of the spire. The temple has panchanga bada, or five divisions, namely, pabhaga, talajangha, bandhana, uparajangha and baranda. The lowermost division, called the pabhaga, has five decorative mouldings, namely, khura, kumbha, patta, kani and basanta. The superstructure (gandi) of the temple has a number of miniature turrets (angashikharas). The superstructure is crowned with a fluted disc-shaped architectural piece called an amalaka, and a vase (kalasa) surmounts it as the crowning finial.
The sculptures have a depth that was lacking in the Mukteswara Temple sculptures.[11] The slightly projecting entrance is flanked by round thick columns entwined by naga on the left. Guardians of the eight directions project from the base of the temple in the eight directions, starting from the gateway in a clockwise direction around the porch and the deul, ending at the torana (entrance).[11] The other noted sculptures are naga-nagi sthambha, saiva dwarapalas on the entrance doorjambs, and lakulisa on the lintel of entrance, above which is the architrave of Navagrahas.[clarification needed] The best-preserved sculptures of the temple are the standing astadikpalas on the central façade of kanika, appearing on the jangha portion of the bada clad in diaphanous drapery. The image of Varuna is intact and notable for its body ornamentation, coiffure and facial expression. Scenes of the marriage of Shiva, Nataraja, and Parvati are the cult images present in the temple. There are tall, slender, sophisticated nayikas gracing the walls of the sanctum depicted in various roles and moods in amorous dalliance with actions such as turning her head from an emaciated ascetic, fondling her child, holding a branch of tree, attending to her toilet, looking into mirror, taking off her anklet, caressing her pet bird and playing instrument. There are also erotic (mithuna) figures carved in high relief on the projecting portions of the uparajangha. The other decorative motifs are carved in the shape of vyala, jagrata and gajakranta. The scroll motifs are of foliage, creepers and vines (vanalata), each containing lush foliage independent of any stalk or vine.
Based on the sculptural architectural style, the temple is dated to the mid-11th century.Brown groups the temple along with Anant Vasudev Temple and places it around the 11th–12th centuries. Another survey of Orissa temples carried out by S. K. Saraswati in 1953 yielded a similar date. Panigrahi, who did a comprehensive analysis of Orissan temples, gives an unspecified date between Lingaraj Temple and Mukteswara Temple.Fergusson believes construction of the temple was begun by around 1105.George Michell believes the temple was built during the same time as Lingaraja Temple.Rajarani Temple roughly belongs to the same period as the Jagannath Templeat Puri. The architecture of other temples in central India originated from this temple. The notable ones in the category are the Khajuraho temples and Totesvara Mahadeo temple in Kadawa. Scholars believe based on the style that the temple might have been built by Somavamsi kings who migrated from Central Indis to Orissa during the period. Rajarani temple is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as a ticketed monument.

Parashurameshvara Temple (IAST: Paraśurāmeśvara) also spelt Parsurameswara, located in the East Indian city of Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha, is considered the best preserved specimen of an early Orissan Hindu temple dated to the Shailodbhava period between the 7th and 8th centuries CE. The temple is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva and is one of the oldest existing temples in the state. It is believed to have been built around 650 CE in Nagara style and has all the main features of the pre-10th century Orissan-style temples. The temple is one among the Parashurameshvara group of temples.
Decorations outside the temple consisting of engravings of divine geese (hamsa) as well as flowers, at the lower part it can be apreciated the symbol of the Purna-Kalasha and on the left the image of a Lingam that represents Shiva.
Parashurameshvara Temple has a vimana, the sanctum, and a bada, the curvilinear spire over its roof, rising to a height of 40.25 ft (12.27 m). It is the first temple to have an additional structure called jagamohana, compared to the earlier temples that had only the vimana. Though the temple is dedicated to Shiva, it contains sculpted images of Shakta deities, which are otherwise normally part of Shakta temples. The temple is the first in Bhubaneswar to contain depictions of Saptamatrikas, namely, Chamunda, Varahi, Indrani, Vaishnavi, Kaumari, Shivani and Brahmi. The temple is maintained and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as a ticketed monument. Parashurashtami is the major festival celebrated in the temple during June–July every year. The temple is one of the most prominent tourist attractions in the state of Odisha.
The Kalingan temples have two parts: the sanctum, called vimana, and a place from where pilgrims view the sanctum, called the jagamohana (hall of worshippers). Parashurameshvara Temple is the first to have this additional structure. The initial deultemples were without the jagamohana as seen in some of the older temples in Bhubaneswar, while the later temples had two additional structures namely nata-mandapa (festival hall) and bhoga-mandapa (hall of offerings). The vimana is square in plan and the walls have sections called rathas or pagas. The vimana has a curvilinear tower (called bada) in the form of a pyramid composed of horizontal planes. The sanctum of the temple measures 9.88 × 9.75 ft (3.0 × 3.0 m) from the inside, 19.75 × 21 ft (6.0 × 6.4 m) from the outside and has a height of 40.25 ft (12.3 m).Amalaka, a stone disk with ridges on the rim, is placed over the bada of the temple.
Pediment outside of the temple, which depicts vampires and demons (vetala) as well as several animals The jagamohana is rectangular in shape and has a two-element sloping roof with clerestory windows between them.The jagamohana measures 24.94 × 18.33 ft (7.6 × 5.6 m) from the inside and 29.33 × 28.58 ft (8.9 × 8.7 m) from the outside.The latticed windows are classified as pata jaliwhere perforations are square or rectangular in shape. In addition, there are trellised windows with slabs of stone sculptures depicting dancers and musicians. Light enters the interior through doors and the latticed windows. The junction of the vimana and the jagmohana is not cleanly built, leading some scholars to postulate that the porch was added at a much later date; however, the primitive connection is attributed to the building technique. The temple was constructed by burying completed portions in inclined layers of earth up which heavy pieces of stone were dragged.
Decorated window on the temple with sculptures of dancers (top) and musicians (below)The temple is one of the earliest examples of the Nagara style of Hindu temple architecture that emphasises vertical structure, as seen in subsequent temples like Mukteshvara, Lingaraj and Rajarani in Bhubaneswar and the Sun Temple at Konark.
Six armed Mahisamardini Durga image in a gavaksha on the towerThe temple contains the earliest representation of a six-armed Mahishamardini (Durga) image, shown inside a gavaksha frame from the chest upward with a headdress, karna kundala (ornament), mala (garland) and kankana (anklet). Durga is seen holding a sword in the upper left hand while in the upper right hand, she is seen pressing the face of the demon buffalo. In her left middle hand, she is seen piercing the neck of the demon with a trishula(trident), while in her lower left hand she holds a pointed weapon. In her right middle hand she holds Khetaka while in her lower right hand she holds a bow. A similar image of Durga is found in the Vaital temple, which is a famous Shakta center.
Though the temple is a Shaiva shrine, it contains the images of numerous Shakta deities as Parsvadevatas sculpted on its walls. The temple is the first among Bhubaneswar temples to contain Saptamatrika images, a group of seven goddesses.These images are located in between representatioof Ganesha and Virabhadra. Except for Ganesha, all other images are depicted with their respective vahanas(vehicles). An eight-armed dancing Ardhanarishvara, an image of Siva-Parvati and the images of Ganga and Yamuna are also found on the wall of the temple.There are also images of Vishnu, Indra, Surya and Yama in the rectangular niches around the base of the porch. A sculpture of Kartikeya riding on his peacock vehicle is present on the southern wall. Other noteworthy carvings are those of Shiva subduing the demon-king Ravana, who is seen trying to uproot Mount Kailasa, the abode of Shiva.Shiva is sculpted as Nataraja invarious tandavas (dance poses) in the temple. As with other Odisha temples, the interiors are not sculpted but left plain. Other carvings on the temple depict a variety of fruits, flowers, birds and animals in scenes and parts of designs. A floral motif trailing from the tail of a bird is common between this temple and the ones in Vaital Deula, while a motif of vase and flowers is common between it and the ones in Mukteshvara Temple.various tandavas (dance poses) in the temple. As with other Odisha temples, the interiors are not sculpted but left plain. Other carvings on the temple depict a variety of fruits, flowers, birds and animals in scenes and parts of designs.

Parashurameshvara Temple is one of the Parashurameshvara group of temples, considered to be the oldest temples in Bhubaneswar.Some historians believe Parashurameshvara Temple to have been built in the early 8th century CE., subsequent to the construction of the Satruguneswar, Bharateswar and Lakshmaneswar temples in the late 7th century, although K.C.Panigrahi places the date as 650 CE.Fergusson believed that the temple might have been initiated at around 500 CE.A mid-7th century date is agreed by most scholars based on style and the presence of the eight planets which appear over the door to the inner sanctum as the later temples portray nine.Parashurameshvara Temple was built by the Shailodbhavas, who had Shiva as their family deity.The Shailodbhavas also respected the Shakta deities and depicted Shakta images on the walls of the temple.The temple was repaired in 1903, with some changes in the roof of the inner sanctum, whilst retaining most of the original structure. Being located in the eastern coast, Parashurameshvara, like other Orissan temples, was not much affected by Muslim invasions of the 12–13th centuries.In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as a ticketed monument

The Shivalingas are said to have been enshrined by Sita, the wife of Lord Rama during their exile. Another story holds that King Banasuraworshiped the Swayambhu Lingas at this place given its beauty. A perennial stream, which is the main attraction of the area, regularly washes the Shivalingas as it flows over them.

As per a legend, a Muslim invader, after destroying numerous temples and Hindu images, reached the region in the 16th century. The then King of Madhupurgarh, hid the central image in the pond to save the idol from Kalapahad.
A few years later, Vishnu appeared to the King and asked him to take the image out of the pond and worship and then to be kept back safely. This happened during Mahavisuva Sankranti or Pana Sankranti period. Since then annually, the image is taken out of the pond on the Pana Sankranti day and worshipped for three days.
The icon of Narayana Gosain is kept underwater in a pond near the temple, Madhutirtha Kshetra, except for three days in a year. People gather on these three days to ctach its glimpse. This annual ceremony is known as Singhapur yatra. This has been a practice here for more than four centuries.
According to the tradition, first the King of Madhupurgarh comes and offers prayers to the Lord on the bank of the pond as Narayan Gosain is the presiding deity of the king. After the King’s puja and prayer, thousands of devotees take part in the ceremony every year.
Since the Raja Birbar Krishna Prakash Dhir Narendra Singh had no son, he had made a public announcement near the pond that, in future, his elder heir and daughter, the Queen of Madhupurgarh, Rani Aparna Dhir Singh will offer the seva puja and pushpanjali to Narayana Gosain. In April 2007, the seva puja was offered by her in his presence and after his death in December 2007, the seva puja and the administration of the deity is being done by Rani Aparna Dhir Narendra Singh and her team of pujaris.

Though capital of Chakrakotamandala is still being debated, it is clear that it has many similar with Kamala Mandala, another ancient name of Kalahandi, Manikya Devi came to Gadapur perhaps due to influence of Chakrakota Mandala.

Lingaraja Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva and is one of the oldest temples in Bhubaneswar, the capital of the East Indian state of Odisha. The temple is the most prominent landmark of Bhubaneswar city and one of the major tourist attractions of the state.
The Lingaraja temple is the largest temple in Bhubaneswar. The central tower of the temple is 180 ft (55 m) tall. The temple represents the quintessence of the Kalinga architecture and culminating the medieval stages of the architectural tradition at Bhubaneswar.The temple is believed to be built by the kings from the Somavamsi dynasty, with later additions from the Gangarulers. The temple is built in the Deula style that has four components namely, vimana (structure containing the sanctum), jagamohana (assembly hall), natamandira (festival hall) and bhoga-mandapa (hall of offerings), each increasing in the height to its predecessor. The temple complex has 50 other shrines and is enclosed by a large compound wall.
Bhubaneswar is called the Ekamra Kshetra as the deity of Lingaraja was originally under a mango tree (Ekamra) as noted in Ekamra Purana, a 13th-century Sanskrit treatise. The temple is active in worship practises, unlike most other temples in Bhubaneswar and Shiva is worshipped as Harihara, a combined form of Vishnu and Shiva. The temple has images of Vishnu, possibly because of the rising prominence of Jagannath sect emanating from the Ganga rulers who built the Jagannath Temple in Puri in the 12th century.
Lingaraja temple is maintained by the Temple Trust Board and the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The temple has an average of 6,000 visitors per day and receives lakhs of visitors during festivals. Shivaratri festival is the major festival celebrated in the temple and event during 2012 witnessed 200,000 visitors. The temple compound is not open to non-Hindus, but there is a viewing platform beside the wall offering a good view of the main exteriors. This was originally erected for a visit by Lord Curzon when Viceroy.
The Lingaraja temple is the largest temple in Bhubaneswar. James Fergusson (1808–86), a noted critic and historian rated the temple as “one of the finest examples of purely Hindu temple in India”. It is enshrined within a spacious compound wall of laterite measuring 520 ft (160 m) by 465 ft (142 m). The wall is 7.5 ft (2.3 m) thick and surmounted by a plain slant coping. Alongside the inner face of the boundary wall, there is a terrace to protect the compound wall against outside aggression. The tower is 45.11 m (148.0 ft) high and the complex has 150 smaller shrines in its spacious courtyard. Each inch of the 55 m (180 ft) tall tower is sculpted.The door in the gate of the entrance porch is made of sandalwood.
The Lingaraja temple faces east and is built of sandstone and laterite. The main entrance is located in the east, while there are small entrances in the north and south. The temple is built in the Deula style that has four components namely, vimana (structure containing the sanctum), jagamohana(assembly hall), natamandira (festival hall) and bhoga-mandapa (hall of offerings), with all four in axial alignment with descending height.The dance hall was associated with the raising prominence of the devadasi system that existed during the time.The various units from the Hall of offering to the tower of the sanctum increase in height.
The bhogamandapa (Hall of offering) measures 42 ft (13 m)*42 ft (13 m) from the inside, 56.25 ft (17.15 m)*56.25 ft (17.15 m) from the outside and has four doors in each of the sides. The exterior walls of the hall has decorative sculptures of men and beast. The hall has a pyramidal roof made of up several horizontal layers arranged in sets of two with intervening platform. It bears an inverted bell and a kalasa in the top.The natamandira(festival hall) measures 38 ft (12 m)*38 ft (12 m) from the inside, 50 ft (15 m)*50 ft (15 m) from the outside, has one main entrance and two side entrances. The side walls of the hall has decortive sculptures displaying women and couples. It has a flat roof sloping in stages. There are thick pylons inside the hall.The jagamohana (assembly hall) measures 35 ft (11 m)*30 ft (9.1 m) from the inside, 55 ft (17 m)*50 ft (15 m) from the outside, entrances from south and north and has a 30 metres (98 ft) tall roof. The hall has a pyramidal roof made of up several horizontal layers arranged in sets of two with intervening platform as in the Hall of offering. The facade to the entrances are decorated with perforated windows with lion sitting on hind legs. The inverted bell above second unit is adorned by kalasa and lions.The rekha deula has a 60 m (200 ft) tall pyramidal tower over the sanctum and measures 22 ft (6.7 m)*22 ft (6.7 m) from the inside, 52 ft (16 m)*52 ft (16 m) from the outside over the sanctum. It is covered with decorative design and seated lion projecting from the walls. The sanctum is square in shape from the inside. The tower walls are sculpted with female figures in different poses.
The temple has a vast courtyard mired with hundreds of small shrines
Lingaraja, literally means the king of Lingam, the iconic form or Shiva. Shiva was originally worshipped as Kirtivasa and later as Harihara and is commonly referred as Tribhuvaneshwara (also called Bhubaneswar), the master of three worlds, namely, heaven, earth and netherworld. His consort is called Bhuvaneshvari.
The temple in its present form dates back to the last decade of the eleventh century. There is evidence that part of the temple was built during the sixth century CE as mentioned in some of the seventh century Sanskrit texts.[5] Fergusson believes that the temple might have been initiated by Lalat Indu Keshari who reigned from 615 to 657 CE. The Assembly hall (jagamohana), sanctum and temple tower were built during the eleventh century, while the Hall of offering (bhoga-mandapa) was built during the twelfth century. The natamandira was built by the wife of Salini between 1099 and 1104 CE.By the time the Lingaraja temple was completely constructed, the Jagannath (form of Vishnu) sect had been growing in the region, which historians believe, is evidenced by the co-existence of Vishnu and Shiva worship at the temple. The kings of Ganga dynasty were ardent followers of Vaishnavism and built the Jagannath Temple at Puri in the 12th century.
As per some accounts, the temple is believed to have been built by the Somavanshi king Yayati I (1025-1040), during the 11th century CE. Jajati Keshari shifted his capital from Jajpur to Bhubaneswar which was referred to as Ekamra Kshetra in the Brahma Purana, an ancient scripture. One of the Somavamsi queens donated a village to the temple and the Brahmins attached to the temple received generous grants. An inscription from the Saka year 1094 (1172 CE) indicates gifts of gold coins to the temple by Rajaraja II. Another inscription of Narasimha I from the 11th century indicates offer of beetel leaves as tambula to the presiding deity.Other stone inscriptions in the temple indicate royal grants from Chodaganga to the nearby village people.
K.C. Panigrahi mentions that Yayti I had no time to build the temple and it should have been initiated by his sons Ananta Kesari and Udyota Kesari (believed to be other names of Yayati II as well). The argument provided against the view is that is his weak successors could not have constructed such a magnificent structure.

Lankeswari Temple is well known for its amazing natural beauty and it is counted as one of unique tourist destinations in the Sonepur/Subarnapur district, Odisha. Lankeswari temple is a delightful shrine. Lankeswari Temple is located inside the river Mahanadi at Sonepur town, Subarnapur district, Odisha, India.
Once upon a time Sonepur region was known as Paschima Lanka. Goddess Lankeswari was the presiding deity of Paschima Lanka. Now Maa Lankeswari is worshiped by the Kaivarta (fisherman) community of Sonepur and people of Subarnapur district. One can see this temple while traveling on the road connecting Ulunda, Dharmasala, Sonepur and Birmaharajpur.
It is believed that the King of Lanka, mighty Ravana brought the goddess Lankeswari from Lanka to Sonepur as he had an army base in Sonepur. Sonepur is often described as Paschima Lanka or Swarnapuri Lanka or Dwitiya Lanka or Subarnapur. This is further evidence that Sonepur is a strong hold of Tantric and Shakti culture.As this area belonged to the Dakshina Kosala Kingdom, the evidence is there in Ramayana that Ravana used to attack this part frequently.
Formerly the rock was worshiped as the deity, but now a structure is built. A deep gorge is formed near the hillock and it is known as Lankeswari Darha. The view of the river and town from the temple is picturesque. Sailing and fishing in the Lankeswari Darha with the local fishermen is a pleasurable experience.

https://www.bharattemples.com/konark-sun-temple-puri-odisha/,"Konark Sun Temple, Puri, Odisha
Konark Temple is one of the famous Sun temples of Odisha. Konark Sun Temple is a 13th century Sun Temple (also known as the Black Pagoda), at Konark, in Odisha. It was constructed from oxidized and weathered ferruginous sandstone by King Narasimhadeva I (1238-1250 CE) of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty. The temple is an example of the Orissan architecture of the Ganga dynasty. The temple is one of the most renowned temples in India and is a World Heritage Site. It is one of the Seven Wonders of India (as per the poll collected by NDTV). Legend has it that the temple was constructed by Samba, the son of Lord Krishna. It is said that Samba was afflicted by leprosy, brought about by his father’s curse on him. After 12 years of penance, he was cured by Surya, the Sun God, in whose honor he built the magnificent Konark Sun Temple.
Konark Sun Temple is a 13th-century CE sun temple at Konark about 35 kilometers (22 mi) northeast from Puri on the coastline of Odisha, India. The temple is attributed to king Narasingha deva I of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty about 1250 CE.
Dedicated to the Hindu ‘god Surya, what remains of the temple complex has the appearance of a 100-foot (30 m) high chariot with immense wheels and horses, all carved from stone. Once over 200 feet (61 m) high,much of the temple is now in ruins, in particular the large shikara tower over the sanctuary; at one time this rose much higher than the mandapa that remains. The structures and elements that have survived are famed for their intricate artwork, iconography, and themes, including erotic kama and mithuna scenes. Also called the Surya Devalaya, it is a classic illustration of the Odisha style of Architecture or Kalinga Architecture.
The cause of the destruction of the Konark temple is unclear and remains a source of controversy.Theories range from natural damage to deliberate destruction of the temple in the course of being sacked several times by Muslim armies between the 15th and 17th centuries.This temple was called the “Black Pagoda” in European sailor accounts as early as 1676 because its great tower appeared black.  Similarly, the Jagannath Temple in Puri was called the “White Pagoda”. Both temples served as important landmarks for sailors in the Bay of Bengal.The temple that exists today was partially restored by the conservation efforts of British India-era archaeological teams. Declared a UNESCO world heritage site in 1984, it remains a major pilgrimage site for Hindus, who gather here every year for the Chandrabhaga Mela around the month of February.
The Konark Sun Temple was built from stone in the form of a giant ornamented chariot dedicated to the Sun god, Surya. In Hindu Vedic iconography Surya is represented as rising in the east and traveling rapidly across the sky in a chariot drawn by seven horses. He is described typically as a resplendent standing person holding a lotus flower in both his hands, riding the chariot marshaled by the charioteer Aruna.The seven horses are named after the seven meters of Sanskrit prosody: Gayatri, Brihati, Ushnih, Jagati, Trishtubha, Anushtubha, and Pankti.Typically seen flanking Surya are two females who represent the dawn goddesses, Usha and Pratyusha. The goddesses are shown to be shooting arrows, a symbol of their initiative in challenging darkness.The architecture is also symbolic, with the chariot’s twelve pairs of wheels corresponding to the 12 months of the Hindu calendar, each month paired into two cycles (Shukla and Krishna).
The Konark temple presents this iconography on a grand scale. It has 24 elaborately carved stone wheels which are nearly 12 feet (3.7 m) in diameter and are pulled by a set of seven horses.When viewed from inland during the dawn and sunrise, the chariot-shaped temple appears to emerge from the depths of the blue sea carrying the sun.
The temple plan includes all the traditional elements of a Hindu temple set on a square plan. According to Kapila Vatsyayan, the ground plan, as well the layout of sculptures and reliefs, follow the square and circle geometry, forms found in Odisha temple design texts such as the Silpasarini. This mandala structure informs the plans of other Hindu temples in Odisha and elsewhere.
The main temple at Konark, locally called the deul, no longer exists. It was surrounded by subsidiary shrines containing niches depicting Hindu deities, particularly Surya in many of his aspects. The deul was built on a high terrace.The temple was originally a complex consisting of the main sanctuary, called the rekha deul, or bada deul (lit. big sanctum). In front of it was the bhadra deul (lit. small sanctum), or jagamohana (lit. assembly hall of the people) (called a mandapa in other parts of India.). The attached platform was called the pida deul, which consisted of a square mandapa with a pyramidal roof.All of these structures were square at their core, and each was overlain with the pancharatha plan containing a variegated exterior.The central projection, called the raha, is more pronounced than the side projections, called kanika-paga, a style that aims for an interplay of sunlight and shade and adds to the visual appeal of the structure throughout the day. The design manual for this style is found in the Silpa Sastra of ancient Odisha.
Twice as wide as they were high, the walls of the jagamohana are 100 feet (30 m) tall. The surviving structure has three tiers of six pidaseach. These diminish incrementally and repeat the lower patterns. The pidas are divided into terraces. On each of these terraces stand statues of musician figures.The main temple and the jagamohana porch consist of four main zones: the platform, the wall, the trunk, and the crowning head called a mastaka.The first three are square while the mastaka is circular. The main temple and the jagamohanadiffered in size, decorative themes, and design. It was the main temple’s trunk, called the gandhi in medieval Hindu architecture texts, that was ruined long ago. The sanctum of the main temple is now without a roof and most of the original parts.
On the east side of the main temple is the Nata mandira (lit. dance temple). It stands on a high, intricately carved platform. The relief on the platform is similar in style to that found on the surviving walls of the temple. According to historical texts, there was an Aruna stambha (lit. Aruna’s pillar) between the main temple and the Nata mandira, but it is no longer there because it was moved to the Jagannatha at Puri sometime during the troubled history of this temple. According to Harle, the texts suggest that originally the complex was enclosed within a wall 865 feet (264 m) by 540 feet (160 m), with gateways on three sides.
The stone temple was made from three types of stone. Chlorite was used for the door lintel and frames as well as some sculptures. Laterite was used for the core of the platform and staircases near the foundation. Khondalite was used for other parts of the temple. According to Mitra, the Khondalite stone weathers faster over time, and this may have contributed to erosion and accelerated the damage when parts of the temples were destroyed. None of these stones occur naturally nearby, and the architects and artisans must have procured and moved the stones from distant sources, probably using the rivers and water channels near the site. The masons then created ashlar, wherein the stones were polished and finished so as to make joints hardly visible.
The original temple had a main sanctum sanctorum (vimana), which is estimated to have been 229 feet (70 m) tall. The main vimana fell in 1837. The main mandapa audience hall (jagamohana), which is about 128 feet (39 m) tall, still stands and is the principal structure in the surviving ruins. Among the structures that have survived to the current day are the dance hall (Nata mandira) and the dining hall
The Konark Sun Temple is located in an eponymous village about 35 kilometers (22 mi) northeast of Puri and 60 kilometers (37 mi) southeast of Bhubaneswar on the Bay of Bengal coastline in the Indian state of Odisha. The nearest airport is Bhubaneswar Airport (IATA: BBI). Both Puri and Bhubaneswar are major railway hubs connected by Indian Railways’ Southeastern services.

Over 500 years ago Madhavendra Puri was going to Puri to get some sandalwood for his Sri Gopal deity in Vrindavana. After a few days in Navadvipa, Sri Puri started for Orissa. Within a few days he arrived at Remuna where Gopinatha is situated. Seeing the beauty of the Deity, Madhavendra Puri was overwhelmed.
In the corridor of the temple, from which people generally viewed the Deity, Madhavendra Puri chanted and danced. Then he sat down there and asked a brahmana what kinds of foods they offered to the Deity. Madhavendra Puri thought: “I shall inquire from the priest what foods are offered to Gopinatha so that by making arrangements in our kitchen, we can also offer similar foods to Sri Gopala.”
When the brahmana priest was questioned in this matter, he explained in detail the types of food that were offered to the Deity of Gopinatha. The brahmana priest said: “In the evening the Deity is offered sweet rice in twelve earthen pots. Because the taste is as good as nectar, it is named amrta keli. This sweet rice is celebrated throughout the world as gopinatha-kheer. It is not offered anywhere else in the world.”
While Madhavendra Puri was talking with the brahmana priest, the sweet rice was placed before the Deity as an offering. Seeing this Madhavendra Puri thought “If, without my asking, a little sweet rice is given to me, I could then taste it and make a similar preparation to offer my Lord Gopala.” Then immediately Madhavendra Puri realised his mistake in desiring to taste the sweet rice, and he immediately repented, “I have committed an offence. I have desired to taste the preparation before it was offered to the Lord.” Thinking in this way Puri Gosvami left and went to a nearby vacant marketplace. Sitting there he began to chant.

Maa Mangala Temple is a Hindu temple in Kakatpur, in the state of Odisha on the eastern coast of India. This is a 15th-century temple and a symbol of the ancient heritage of Kalinga. The holy Bay of Bengal is situated in the eastern side of the temple, the temple is situated at the eastern bank holy river “The Prachi” ,the Holy river Prachi was named as swaraswati before. The temple is reachable by the roads from cuttack, Bhubaneswar, Puri, Jagtsinghapur and paradeep which are approximately 69 km,60 km,55 km,38 km and 83 km respectively and is well connected by roads.The nearest railway station is Bhubaneswar and the nearest airport is also Bhubaneswar.”Maa Mangala” is a Hindu goddess who is the manifestations of “SHAKTI”.The worship of the goddess is a part of the culture of odisha.Before she was worshiped as goddess “Tara” by Buddhist monks. But when the deity was established at kakatpur, she was worshiping as the manifestations of Goddess “Durga”.She is worshiping in the hymn of the goddess “Banadurga”. The curving style of the deity Mangala is typical odiya style,having khilana & prava back to her sitting place.Also the style of temple is “Utkaliya Vimana Style”
The temple is built in typical Kalinga style and is a major pilgrimage for devotees of Shakti cult. Pilgrims frequent the temple seeking boons from Maa Mangala. There is a bed made of solid stone on which it is said Maa Mangala rests after touring the entire universe every day. As if to attest to this, the bed looks worn out in just the same way it would if it were in use for centuries.
Evolution of the name of the deity as ‘Maa Mangala’ hails from a legend believed by the locals of Kakatpur village. Goddess Managla kept herself hidden under the deep water of river Prachi. Once a boatman was sailing his boat across river Prachi. At that time the river was outpouring and flooded so he was unable to sail his boat to the middle of the river. He spent whole day and night but not able to sail his boat and during early morning, before the dawn, Goddess Mangala came in his dream and asked him to recover her from the water and to establish her in nearby Mangalapur village. The boatman dived into the water and able to find the deity from the bed of the river. Then as per the direction of the Goddess he established the figure of the deity in a temple in Mangalapur village. After this the boatman saw a black crow dived into the water and did not come out of the water for hours and days, the crow detained inside the water of river Prachi exactly in the same place from where he recovered the figure of Goddess Mangala. In local oriya language ‘Crow’ means ‘Kaka’ and ‘Detained’ means ‘Atka’. So by combining the two words it becomes ‘Kaka-Atka’, so during the course of time the Mangalapur village is known as ‘Kakata’ (Kaka-Atka) pur and the Goddess is known as Kakatpur Mangala. That time before 500 years ago Local Jamindar Roychudamoni family has made the mandir at Kakatpur with all the Sebak arrangement. This Mandir was Made by Panchanan Mitra(Roychudamoni) on 1548A:D. This goddess is very famous with all the qualities of peace, power, happiness, love, purity, knowledge & truth. [1]

The King complied with the desire of the lord by constructing the present temple, which is located on the western embankment of the Jalesvara pond. To conduct the rituals and other associated activities of the temple the King gave land grants to the Brahmins of Rahanga sasan and other Sevayatas. Hence the place is known as Kalarahanga.

The Shree Jagannath Temple of Puri is an important Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Jagannath, a form of lord Vishnu, located on the eastern coast of India, at Puri in the state of Odisha. The temple is an important pilgrimage destination The present temple was rebuilt from the 10th century onwards, on the site of an earlier temple, and begun by King Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva, first of the Eastern Ganga dynasty.
The Puri temple is famous for its annual Ratha yatra, or chariot festival, in which the three principal deities are pulled on huge and elaborately decorated temple cars. These gave their name to the English term Juggernaut. Unlike the stone and metal icons found in most Hindu temples, the image of Jagannath is made of wood and is ceremoniously replaced every twelve or nineteen years by an exact replica.
The temple is sacred to all Hindus and especially in those of the Vaishnava traditions. Many great saints, such as Ramananda and Ramanuja were closely associated with the temple. Ramanuja established the Emar Mutt near the temple and the Govardhan Mutt, which is the seat of one of the four Shankaracharyas. It is also of particular significance to the followers of the Gaudiya Vaishnavismwhose founder Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, was attracted to the deity, Jagannath, and lived in Puri for many years.
According to legend, the construction of the first Jagannath temple was commissioned by King Indradyumna, son of Bharata and Sunanda, and a Malava king, mentioned in the Mahabharata and the Puranas.
The legendary account as found in the Skanda-Purana, Brahma Purana and other Puranas and later Odia works state that Lord Jagannath was originally worshipped as Lord Neela Madhaba by a Savar king (tribal chief) named Viswavasu. Having heard about the deity, King Indradyumna sent a Brahmin priest, Vidyapati to locate the deity, who was worshipped secretly in a dense forest by Viswavasu. Vidyapati tried his best but could not locate the place. But at last he managed to marry Viswavasu’s daughter Lalita. At repeated request of Vidyapti, Viswavasu took his son-in-law blind folded to a cave where Lord Neela Madhaba was worshipped.
Vidyapati was very intelligent. He dropped mustard seeds on the ground on the way. The seeds germinated after a few days, which enabled him to find out the cave later on. On hearing from him, King Indradyumna proceeded immediately to Odra desha (Odisha) on a pilgrimage to see and worship the Deity. But the deity had disappeared. The king was disappointed. The Deity was hidden in sand. The king was determined not to return without having a darshan of the deity and observed fast unto death at Mount Neela, Then a celestial voice cried ‘thou shalt see him.’ Afterward, the king performed a horse sacrifice and built a magnificent temple for Vishnu. Sri Narasimha Murti brought by Narada was installed in the temple. During sleep, the king had a vision of Lord Jagannath. Also an astral voice directed him to receive the fragrant tree on the seashore and make idols out of it. Accordingly, the king got the image of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra, Subhadra and Chakra Sudarshan made out of the wood of the divine tree and installed them in the temple.

The thief prayed fervently to Lord Shiva to deliver him from the crowd. Taking pity on him, the Lord appeared as a Sanyassin before the crowd and asked them the cause of their agitation On being told that they suspected the thief of hiding in the sanctum along with the black calf, the sanyassin brought the calf outside to dispel their doubts. The calf turned out to be white, seeing which the crowd let the thief go. The sanyassin disappeared and the thief realized who had come to his aid. He confessed and apologized to the crowd. He took a vow to spend the rest of his life in the service of the Lord. The act of turning a black calf to white caused Lord Shiva to be also known as Dhabaleswara.

The presiding deity is an eight-armed goddess Chamunda, locally known as Maa Charchika Devi. She is seated on a prostrate human body and wearing a garland of human skulls. She displays khadga, shula, katari and varadamudra in her four right hands whereas the four left hands represent severed head, blood-cup, ‘’damru’’ and leaving a finger of the remaining hand soaked in blood. This temple is situated on the top a small hillock Ruchika Parvata on the bed of the Renuka river in the small town of Banki in Cuttackdistrict of Orissa.
The present temple was reconstructed in the 19th century. But the remarkable point is the enshrining deity Maa Charchika on iconographical point of view can be assigned to the 9th – 10th centuries A.D. i.e. Bhaumakara rule in Orissa. It is believed that the Charchika idol was created by Parashurama. The temple has a pidha vimana, jagamohana and a wooden mandapa known as “sunyavahini mandapa” of impoverished Kalingan order. Stone is used for the construction of the temple and the entire surface is thickly lime plastered and white washed. The ceiling of the mandapa is made of wood whereas the pillars are in stone.

The Renuka river was recreated by the flood of 1982. It’s believed that one devotee who worshiped Maa Charchika after pleasing her took away all ornaments of Maa Charchika and build a house where River Renuka is currently flowing. As Maa Charchika was not happy so she created this River Renuka to punish him and to make him home less. This temple is situated in the heart of Banki. It’s good to visit the temple at the time of Durga Puja, a Hindu festival in the month of October thousands of devotee used to come to get the blessing. Kumar Purnima a Hindu festival celebrated 5 days after Dusshera is very famous here.

https://www.bharattemples.com/brahmeswara-temple-bhubaneswar-odisha/,"Brahmeswara Temple, Bhubaneswar, Odisha
Brahmeswara Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva located in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, erected at the end of the 9th century CE, is richly carved inside and out. This Hindu temple can be dated with fair accuracy by the use of inscriptions that were originally on the temple. They are now lost, but records of them preserve the information of around 1058 CE. The temple is built in the 18th regnal year of the Somavamsi king Udyotakesari by his mother Kolavati Devi, which corresponds to 1058 CE
The temple is classified as a panchatanaya temple where apart from the main shrine, there are four subsidiary shrines in the four corners around the temple. The temple on account of its later origin, has perfectly developed structure compared to its predecessors. The vimana of the temple is 18.96 m (62.2 ft) tall.The temple is built with traditional architectural methods of wood carving, but applied on stone building. The buildings were built in a shape of full volume pyramid, and then they would be carved inside and outside.
The basic structure of the Orissan temple has two connecting buildings. The smaller is the Jagmohana, or assembly hall. Behind it is the Shikhara, the towering sanctuary. Later temples have two additional halls in front—one for dancing, and the other for banquets.[3]
The Brahmeswara shows quite a bit of affinity with the much earlier Mukteswar Temple, including the carved interior of the Jagmohana, and in the sculptural iconography such as the lion head motif, which appeared for the first time in the Mukteswara, and is here evident in profusion. There are quite a number of innovations, however, including the introduction of a great number of musicians and dancers, some holding lutes, on the exterior walls. For the first time in temple architectural history iron beams find their first use.
On sandstone walls there are symbolic decorations and the notion of godlike figures that helps the believer in his meditation. The carvings over the door frame contain beautiful flower designs as well as flying figures. Like the Rajarani, there are images of the eight directional Guardian Deities. There are also quite a number of tantric-related images, and even Chamunda appears on the western facade, holding a trident and a human head, standing on a corpse. Shiva and other deities are also depicted in their horrific aspects.
One of the lost inscriptions stated that a Queen Kolavati presented ‘many beautiful women’ to the temple, and it has been suggested that this is an evidence of the ‘Devadasi’ tradition, which assumed such importance in later Orissan temple architecture and temple life.
Historians place the temple to belong to the late 11th century as ascertained from an inscription carried to Calcutta from Bhubaneswar. The inscription indicates that the temple was built by Kolavatidevi, the mother of Somavamsi king Udyota Kesari. It was built with four Natyasalas at a place known as Siddhatirtha in Ekamra (modern day Bhubaneswar). The inscription was recorded during the 18th renal year of Udyotha Kesari, corresponding to 1060 CE. Since the inscription is not in its original place, historians indicate the possibility of the reference to another temple, but based on the location and other features specified, it is ascertained that the inscription belongs to the temple. Also, another issue raised by Panigrahi is that the four cardinal temples are Angasalas (associate temples) and not Natyasalas (dance halls) as indicated in the inscription.

https://www.bharattemples.com/biraja-temple-jajpur-odisha/,"Biraja Temple, Jajpur, Odisha
Maa Biraja Temple is an historic Hindu temples located in Jajpur (about 125 kilometres (78 mi) north of Bhubaneswar), Odisha, India. Biraja or Viraja Temple is one of the important Maha Shakthi Peetas. Here the main idol Durga Devi is worshipped as Girija (Viraja) and Lord Shiva as Jagannath. Sati’s navel fell here. Adi Sankara describes the goddess as Girija in his Ashtadasha shakti peetha stuti. Here Maa Biraja Devi is worshiped as Trishakti Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati.
The Maa Biraja Temple covers a large area, and has several shrines to Shiva and other deities. According to the Skanda Purana it cleanses pilgrims, and it is called the Viraja or the Biraja kshetra. Jajpur is believed to have about one crore of Shiva lingams.
The primary ritual in the temple is Sharadiya Durga Puja, which begins on the night of Krishna Paksha Ashtami. This falls before Mahalaya, and ends on Ashwin Shukla Paksha Navami. The puja, known as Shodasha Dinatatmika Puja, lasts for 16 days. The ratha (chariot festival) is known as Simhadhwaja, and its flag bears a lion. 
During the lunar transition from Shukla Ashtami to Shukla Navami an animal sacrifice, Bali Daanam, is performed. Navratri is celebrated as Aparajita Puja. Other festivals include Nakshatra, Shravana, Prathamastami, Pana Sankranti, Raja Parva and Navanna. Devi is worshiped daily in accordance with Tantra and Agama traditions as Mahishasuramardini by the Brahmins of Jajpur.
No historical record is available about the pristine glory of the great mother goddess Biraja before the great epic the Mahabharata was written. There is a reference to Virajah-Tirtha in the Vanaparva of the Mahabharata in chapter 85. Moreover the said epic reiterates that the Virajah-Tirtha was a sacred place for Vedic sacrifices where Dharma, the God of Righteousness had performed a great sacrifice. During the performance of sacrifice Rudra -Siva is said to have been accepted as an Aryan God by other Gods and the mother Earth had appeared in the form of altar. Therefore, it is but natural that the goddess Earth was worshipped as goddess Biraja of the Virajah-Tirtha, Later on. The Ṛigvedic earth goddess was a vaishnavite deity and so became goddess Biraja of the Virajah-Tirtha. The Mahabharata is as old as 7th-6th century B.C. as determined by the scholars. The historicity of goddess Biraja goes back to the days Mother Goddess worship of the Atharva Vedic period i.e. 13th century B.C.
She was originally worshipped in the form of an altar and later on in the form of Stambhesvari (pillar Goddess) as was the primitive practice when carving of stone; metal or wooden images were yet to come about. Most probably she was vindhyavasini and Biraja as they named her. During the Gupta rule in India in the 4th century AD, Goddess Biraja was metamorphosed in the theriomorphic form and a stone image of two-armed Mahisamardini was installed in a temple after a great Vedic sacrifice beside the river Vaitaraṇi. Since then she is being worshipped on the pedestal as the symbol of paramavaiṣnavi Sakti icon. Simultaneously Nabhigaya, a great Pitṛ Tirtha, Isanesvara, lord Varaha and many ancillary deities were added to the Biraja tradition. We are apprised of her greatness from several copper plate grants of Durjaya, Vigraha, Dutta and Maṇa royal dynasties who patronised and revered the deity.
During Bhaumakara rule in 10th -11th century AD, a beautiful temple for Goddess Biraja had been built by Candihar Yayati II. Biraja Kṣetra was made a full-fledged Sakti piṭha with the association of Aṣṭa Candi, Aṣṭa-Bhairava, Navadurga, Sapta Matṛka, Trayodasa Rudra, Dvadasa Gaṇesa, Sixty eight Tirthas and Causaṭhi Yogini during Bhaumakara and Somavamsi period. The Somavamsis added a car festival or Rathayatra with the Biraja tradition like that of the Goddess Vindhyavasini and Sthambhesvari of mid-India. Though during the Mughal Afghan rule the Sakti worship relating to Goddess Biraja faced the ups and downs, the tradition continues undeterred till today.
According to Brahmanda Purana, once Brahma (the creator of the Universe) performed a Yajna (great sacrifice) on the river Baitrani. Parvati emerged from the Garhapatya fire as a result of Brahma’s invocation and advised Brahma to name her as Biraja. Brahma prayed to Parvati and asked her to stay at the Kshetra as the divine consort of Siva. Parvati agreed and created Nine Durgas, Sixty Four Yoginis, Eight Chandikas and asked them to remain in the Kshetra permanently. Due to the presence of these deities, this land was well known as Shakti Peetha. At Biraja Temple, Lord Vishnu is in Varaha incarnation.
Jajati Keshari, a ruler of Kesari dynasty built the Biraja temple in Jajati Nagar (now Jajpur) in 13th century during the Kalinga time. The deity, Maa Biraja which stands 70 ft from the floor is said to be worshipped from 5th Century. The temple is named after the King Jajati Keshari. According to the legend, the place is also known as ‘Gadakhestra’, as Bhima’s Gada (mace) was lying in this holy place. In front of the temple stand two lions above elephant. This is indicative of the greatness of Keshari dynasty (Symbol of Lion) than Gajapati dynasty (Symbol of elephant) in Orissa.
A great Yagna (sacrificial oblation) was performed over the body of Gayasur, (the great demon devotee of Lord Vishnu) by the Lords Shiva, Brahma and Vishnu to kill the demon. Gayasur’s feet were in Pada Gaya (a place in Pithapuram, Andhra Pradesh), nabhi (Navel) in Biraja Kshetra or today’s Jajpur, known as Nabhi Gaya and head at Shiro Gaya. The exact spot is in a well that lies inside the Biraja temple just close to Maa Biraja.
The nearest railway station is Cuttack and Jajpur Keonjhar Road. From there regular buses can be availed to Jajpur town. Mostly private buses run regularly in Orissa. Autos connect Cuttack railway station to Barabati bus stand, which is hardly 3 km away. The bus from Cuttack to Jajapur town takes 2 to 2+1⁄2 hours. From Jajpur road to Jajpur town travelling time by road will be more than one hour. Also buses are available from Bhubaneswar. Buses which have express written on the buses are quicker than local buses.
A couple of lodges are next to the temple and another is being constructed.

There are several stories surrounding Lord Baladeva Jeu at Kendrapara. Kandarasura, a demon king, destroyer of Yajnas (sacrifices) , was ruling over the area surrounding Lalitagiri and Assia mountain ranges. Tulasi kshetra Mahatmya reveals that he lived near Lalitagiri – Alatigiri and was terrifying people. Lord Balabhadra defeated him in a fight as a result of which he left the place, went to Kapilas mountain near Dhenkanal and lived in disguise in the nearest mountain ranges as he was an ardent devotee of Lord Siva. Lord Balabhadra thoroughly searched every nook and corner of the hill and lastly ploughed the hill with his plough (hala) as a result of which one perennial spring emerged from the hill, which is now called ‘Langal Siar Jharana’ (spring of the plough). After persuading him from Kapilas, Lord Balabhadra killed the wicked demon Kandarasura in a fight and threw his slain body all over nearby places by cutting it into pieces.
It is a popular belief among the local people that the scattered body was fallen at Asureswar, Balagandi, Kamar Khandi, Navi Khanda which places are named after the head (Aswa Sira), trunk (Gandi of Aswa) waist (Kamar-Khanda) and Naval (peice of Navi) of the demon Kandarasura respectively. It is also believed that the Siva temples of Swapneswar at Kantia, Lankeswara of Gualisingh, Bileswar of Kagal were founded by Baladeva over the face, neck and waist of the demon respectively, Balagandi, the place where the trunk of Kandarasura had fallen is called Kandara padi (Kendrapara). According to his name, the place name ‘Kandharapara’ or ‘Kendrapara’ has been derived.
Before killing the demon, Lord Balabhadra at first killed Madhudaitya, the chief military general of Kandarasura at Lalitagiri through his war weapon plough. The blood gushing out from the body of the general formed a river named Madhusagar (now Gobari river) which flow towards east by the side of Kandarasura Menhir and ultimately meet the sea.
Lord Balaram married Tulasi, the only daughter of Kandarasura on the 12th day of the bright fortnight in the month of Magha which is observed with pomp and ceremony every year as ‘Tulasi bibaha day’ (marriage day of Tulasi) in the Baladeva Jeu Temple, Kendrapara. The place where this marriage was performed is renamed as Tulasi Kshetra. The deity of Tulasi Devi is worshipped in a temple near village Gochha on the northern side of the road from Kendrapara to Ichhapur.
The Deity of Baladeva Jeu– It is said that after the departure of Lord Balarama to his own abode, he established himself as a deity to be worshipped here. This deity was worshipped by Devatas (demigods) at the door of Patalpuri which is identified with Lalitagiri in Dwapar Yuga. When Kali yuga appeared Buddha Dharma (Buddhism) spread over the area. At this time, this deity of Baladev jeu was hid in water of Madhusagar (river Gobari). After many years, a great devotee of Lord Balaram of the name Gopal Siddha Das, who was a cowherd boy discovered this deity of Balabhadra near Siddha Sarobar. Since then, this deity is worshipped at Kendrapara. The deity is also worshipped as Siddha Baladev Jeu after the name of Gopal Siddha Das, who discovered the deity first for all people to worship. The present shrine of Siddha Baladeva Jeu was constructed during the Maratha rule in Orissa
(1761 AD) by Maratha chief Janoji. The stone Deity of Lord Balabhadra and wooden deities of Jagannath, Subhadra and Sudarsan are all worshipped here according to the rituals of the temple in Lord Jagannath at Puri.
The Ratha Chariot The chariot on which the three Deities of Baladev Jew Temple go out on Their yearly car festival is known as Brahma Taladhwaja Ratha. This is said to be the biggest chariot in the world. Every year, some parts of the chariot are built anew, unlike the chariots of Puri Car Festival, which are completely rebuilt each year. When Sri Brahma Taladhwaja Ratha rolls out, it appears like a grand temple on wheels. Car festival (Rathyatra) of Lord Balabhadra in the Tulasi Khetra is celebrated on the 2nd day of bright fortnight in the month of Asadha just like the Car Festival of Pur.

In form, the temple resembles the Lingaraj temple, but includes vaishnavite (Lord Vishnu related) sculptures.The temple has longitudinal bands of miniature shikharas (shrines), exactly like those in Lingaraj temple, with the minor difference that the number of the shikharas forming one longitudinal band in its case is only three.The sculpture in the exterior walls varies in character in each temple in Bhubaneswar. Most of the female sculptures in the temple walls are overly ornamanted and lack originality.
It appears that the original image of Vishnu was worshipped on the spot where the great temple of Ananta Vasudeva was built in the 13th century A.D. Thus in the 13th century, Queen Chandrika of Eastern Ganga dynasty was prompted to construct a new temple – the temple of Ananta Vasudeva in this place. There must have been an old temple where this Vishnu image was installed. The Marathas, who extended their empire up to river Mahanadi, were responsible for renovating the Vishnu temple at Bhubaneswar in the late 17th Century.

The Golden Temple, also known as Darbar Sahib  or Sri Harmandir Sahib is a Gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India.It is the holiest Gurdwara and the most important pilgrimage site of Sikhism.
The temple is built around a man-made pool (sarovar) that was completed by Guru Ram Das in 1577. Guru Arjan – the fifth Guru of Sikhism, requested Sai Mian Mir – a Muslim Pir of Lahore to lay its foundation stone in 1589.In 1604, Guru Arjan placed a copy of the Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib, calling the site Ath Sath Tirath (lit. “shrine of 68 pilgrimages”).The temple was repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs after it became a target of persecution and was destroyed several times by the Muslim armies from Afghanistan and the Mughal Empire.The army led by Ahmad Shah Abdali, for example, demolished it in 1757 and again in 1762, then filled the pool with garbage.Maharaja Ranjit Singh after founding the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809, overlaid the sanctum with gold foil in 1830. This has led to the name the Golden Temple.
The temple is spiritually the most significant shrine in Sikhism. It became a center of the Singh Sabha Movement between 1883 and 1920s. In the early 1980s, the temple became a center of conflict between the Indian government led by Indira Gandhi, some Sikh groups and a militant movement led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale seeking to create a new nation named Khalistan. In 1984, Gandhi sent in the Indian Army as part of Operation Blue Star, leading to deaths of over 1,000 militants, soldiers and civilians, as well as causing much damage to the temple and the destruction of Akal Takht. The temple complex was rebuilt again after the 1984 damage.
The Harmandir Sahib is an open boat of worship for all men and women, from all walks of life and faith. It has a square plan with four entrances, has a circumambulation path around the pool. The temple is a collection of buildings around the sanctum and the pool. One of these is Akal Takht, the chief center of religious authority of Sikhism. Additional buildings include a clock tower, the offices of Gurdwara Committee, a Museum and a langar – a free Sikh community run kitchen that serves a simple vegetarian meal to all visitors without discrimination.Over 100,000 people visit the holy shrine daily for worship.The temple complex has been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its application is pending on the tentative list of UNESCO.
According to the Sikh historical records, the land that became Amritsar and houses the Harimandar Sahib was chosen by Guru Amar Das– the third Guru of the Sikh tradition. It was then called Guru Da Chakk, after he had asked his disciple Ram Das to find land to start a new town with a man made pool as its central point. After Ram Das succeeded Guru Amar Das in 1574, and given the hostile opposition he faced from the sons of Guru Amar Das,Guru Ram Das founded the town that came to be known as “Ramdaspur”. He started by completing the pool with the help of Baba Buddha (not to be confused with the Buddha of Buddhism). Guru Ram Das built his new official centre and home next to it. He invited merchants and artisans from other parts of India to settle into the new town with him.
Ramdaspur town expanded during the time of Guru Arjan financed by donations and constructed by voluntary work. The town grew to become the city of amristsar , and the pool area grew into the Golden Temple complex.The construction activity between 1574 and 1604 is described in Mahima Prakash Vartak, a semi-historical Sikh hagiography text likely composed in 1741, and the earliest known document dealing with the lives of all the ten Gurus.Guru Arjan installed the scripture of Sikhism inside the new temple in 1604.Continuing the efforts of Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan established Amritsar as a primary Sikh pilgrimage destination. He wrote a voluminous amount of Sikh scripture including the popular Sukhmani Sahib

The temple of Jeenmata was a place of pilgrimage from early times and was repaired and rebuilt several times. There is a popular belief which has come down to people through the centuries that in a village Ghanghu of Churu, King Ghangh loved and married an Apsara (nymph) on the condition that he would not visit her palace without prior information. King Ghangh got a son called Harsha and a daughter Jeen. Afterwards she again conceived but as chance would have it king Ghangh went to her palace without prior intimation and thus violated solemn vow he had made to the Apsara. Instantly she left the king and fled away with her son Harsha and daughter Jeen whom she abandoned at the place where presently the temple stands. The two children here practiced extreme asceticism. Later a Chauhan ruler built the temple at that place.

A large number of Jeen Mata followers reside in Kolkata (who are enrooted to shekhawati) who keep visiting Jeen Mata temple. People who revere Jeen mata as their mother pray for birth of male child in the family and vow to visit the temple only after a son is born. After the birth of male child the entire family visits Jeen Mata ji and the first hair cut (known as Jadula in Rajasthani language) of the kid is offered at the temple premises. Followers also offer offerings of 50 kg prasad (sawa man equals 50 kg) known as sawa mani at the temple.
Mugal Emperor Aurangzeb wanted to raze to the ground the Mandir of Mata. Being invoked by Her priests, the Mata let out its army of bhairons (a species of fly family) which brought the Emperor and his soldiers to their knees. He sought pardon and the Kind hearted Mataji excused him from Her anger. Aurangzeb donated akhand (Ever-glow) oil lamp from his Delhi palace in honour of Mataji. This lamp is still glowing in the sacred sanctorium of the Mata.

https://www.bharattemples.com/salasar-balaji-churu-rajasthan/,"Salasar Balaji, Churu, Rajasthan
Salasar Balaji or Salasar Dham in India is a place of religious importance for the devotees of Hanuman. It is located in the town of Salasar, on National Highway 65 near Sujangarh in Churu district, Rajasthan. The temple of Balaji founded by a Jat is situated in the middle of Salasar and attracts innumerable worshippers throughout the year. On Chaitra Purnima and Ashvin Purnima, large fairs are organised that attract devotees as they pay homage to the deity.
Salasar Balaji is in the religious circuit that includes the pilgrim centres of Rani Sati Temple, Jeen Mata and Khatushyamji, which are located close to it. Initially a small construction, the temple of Salasar Balaji is now considered to be a Shakti Sthal (a shrine) and Swayambhu (self creation) by faith, belief, miracles and wish fulfilments of the devotees.
The temple was constructed over a period of about two years using bricks, stones, cement, lime mortar, and white marble. While white marble is used extensively throughout, the entire circulatory path, the Sabha Mandap (prayer hall) and the Sanctum Sanctorum are covered with artistic works of gold and silver. The vestibule, the doors and the utensils used in worshipping are made of silver. The main gate is made up of carving works of white marble. The temple shrine and the sanctum sanctorum are decorated with floral patterns and other kinds of mosaic works done in gold and silver.
One claims the discovery of the site by Ginthala Jats of Asota village in Nagaur district of Rajasthan. On one Saturday of Shraavanashukla Navami samvat 1811 (1754 AD), a miracle happened. A Ginthala Jat farmer of Asota village was ploughing his field when all of sudden the plough was hit by a stony thing and a resonating sound was created. He dug up the soil of that place and found an idol covered with sand. His wife reached there with his lunch. The farmer showed the idol to his wife. She cleaned up the idol with her saree. The idol was that of Balaji (Hanuman). They bowed their heads with devotion and worshipped Balaji. The news of appearance of Balaji soon spread in the Asota village and reached the Thakur of Asota. That night Balaji appeared in Thakur’s dream and ordered him to send the idol to Salasar in the Churu district. Same night a devotee of Hanuman, Mohandas Maharaj of Salasar saw Hanuman or Balaji in his dream too. Balaji told him about the idol of Asota. He immediately sent a message to the Thakur of Asota. The thakur was surprised to discover that Mohandas knew even minor details without coming to Asota. Certainly it was due to the divine powers of Balaji. The idol was sent to Salasar and was consecrated at the place presently known as Salasar Dham.
A slightly modified version to the same story indicates that upon seeing the dream of appearance of the Hanuman, the Thakur of that village ordered the idol to be shifted to Salasar and placed at the temple for the religious rituals to be performed. He brought two bulls, placed the idol on its cart and left them in the open courts believing to build the temple at the place where the bulls would stop. The place where the bulls stopped was given the present name of Salasar. Many of the villagers, shopkeepers and traders shifted their living to Salasar and thus a new village was formed.

Srikurmam Kurmanathaswamy Temple (also known as Srikurmam temple) is a Hindu temple in the Gara mandal of the Srikakulam district in the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It is dedicated to the Kurma avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu, who is worshipped as Kurmanathaswamy, and his consort Lakshmi, worshipped as Kurmanayaki. According to Hindu legend, the presiding deity is believed to have manifested here in the form of a tortoise-shaped idol upon the wishes of Swetha Chakravarthi. Brahma then consecrated the idol with Gopala Yantra. The temple is famous for ancestor worship.
Srikurmam is the only Indian temple in the world where Vishnu is worshiped in his Kurma avatar. Initially dedicated to Shiva and referred to as Kurmeswara temple, Ramanuja is said to have converted Srikurmam into a Vaishnavite temple in the 11th century AD. Since then, the temple was regarded as an important centre of Vaishnavism in the medieval period along with Simhachalam. The temple has two dhvajasthambas, a rarity for a Vaishnavite temple. 108 ekasila (single-stone) pillars, with none resembling each other, bear few inscriptions related to the royal lineages that existed in this area in the past. A tortoise park has been built to conserve the adult and young star tortoises, making Srikurmam the only conservation centre for this species.Srikurmam follows both Shaivite and Vaishnavite traditions of worship. Four daily rituals and four annual festivals are celebrated in Srikurmam, out of which the three-day Dolotsavam is the major one. Gajapathi Rajus of Vizianagaram are the trustees of the temple, which is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Andhra Pradesh. The Indian postal department issued a stamp featuring the temple on 11 April 2013.
 
The temple is situated in the Gara mandal of the Srikakulam district, which is located at a distance of 130 kilometres (81 mi) from Visakhapatnam. Considered the only Indian temple where the Hindu deity Vishnu is worshipped in the form of a tortoise, Srikurmam is 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) away from Srikakulam town and 3.5 kilometres (2.2 mi) away from the Suryanarayana temple, Arasavalli. Believed to have been built before the 2nd century AD,the temple is popular among the Tamil diaspora as well because it is a Vaishnavite temple. Initially dedicated to Shiva and referred to as Kurmeswara temple, Ramanuja is said to have converted Srikurmam into a Vaishnavite temple in the 11th century AD.His disciples established Vaishnavism in the temple with the support of Kalinga king Anantavarman Chodaganga, the eastern Ganga king.After this incident, a group of devadasis were employed to sing and dance daily before the deity in the morning and evening.

However, the statue that was made could not be installed as the toe nail of the idol got broken. The sage was upset over this and performed a penance for Shiva.

Though a small village, historically it is very important, because it has a beautiful Siva Temple which is popularly known as “the Parasurameswara Temple.”The main importance of the temple lies in the Linga which is housed in the Garbhagriha of the temple and considered unique for its naturalistic depection. This is supposed to be the earliest Linga discovered so far and it has been assigned to the 3rd century BCE. The name of the temple is mentioned as Parasurameswara Temple in the inscriptions. These inscriptions do not refer to the original builders of the temple. But they register the gifts made to the temple like land, money and cows for the conduct of daily worship in the temple. The Black and Redware sherds of the 2nd or 3rd century AD have been brought to light during the course of excavations conducted in 1973. Potsherds of the Andhra Satavahana period (Circa 1st century AD to 2nd century AD) and large sized bricks measuring 42x21x6 inches of the same period have also been found.

The Shri Varaha Lakshmi Narasimha temple, Simhachalam is a Hindu temple situated on the Simhachalam hill, which is 500 metres above the sea level in the north of Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. It is dedicated to one of the Hindu trinity deitiesVishnu, who is worshipped there as Varaha Narasimha. As per the temple’s legend (which is divided into 32 chapters), Vishnu manifested in this peculiar form, with a boar head, human torso and a lion’s tail, after saving his devotee Prahlada from a murder attempt by the latter’s father Hiranyakashipu. Except on Akshaya Tritiya, the idol of Varaha Narasimha is covered with sandalwood paste throughout the year, which makes it resemble a Shiva Lingam.
Simhachalam is one of the 32 Narasimha temples in Andhra Pradesh which are important pilgrimage centres. It was regarded as an important centre of Vaishnavism in the medieval period along with Srikurmam and others. The temple has been recognised by historians with the help of a 9th-century AD inscription by the Chalukya Chola king Kulottunga I. In the later half of the 13th century, the temple complex underwent radical physical changes during the reign of the Eastern Ganga king Narasimhadeva I. It later received patronage from many royal families, of which Tuluva dynasty of Vijayanagara Empire is a notable one. The temple underwent 40 years of religious inactivity from 1564 AD to 1604 AD. In 1949, the temple came under the purview of the state government and is currently administered by the Simhachalam Devasthanam Board.
Simhachalam temple resembles a fortress from outside with three outer courtyards and five gateways. The architecture is a mixture of the styles of the Kalinga Architecture/Odishan(Orissan), Chalukyas and the Cholas. The temple faces west instead of east, signifying victory. There are two temple tanks: Swami Pushkarini near the temple and Gangadhara at the bottom of the hill. The temple houses a number of sub-shrines and a few mandapams. The religious practices and customs of the temple are formulated by the Vaishnavite philosopher Ramanuja. They are modelled based on the Satvata Samhita, one of the 108 texts of the Pancharatra Agama.
Simhachalam is the second-largest after Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh in terms of income earned. It is believed that the deity is capable of giving progeny to women and fulfilling wishes of devotees. Kalyanotsava and Chandanotsava are the two major festivals celebrated in the temple, followed by Narasimha Jayanti, Navaratrotsava and Kamadahana. The festivals celebrated in Simhachalam have an influence of the Dravida Sampradaya, the customs followed in Tamil Nadu. Apart from those by well known poets, the temple found many literary references and lyrical works dedicated by anonymous writers which are preserved in the Government Oriental Manuscripts Library, Chennai.

Vayu is incarnated as Lord Shiva and worshipped as Kalahasteeswara. Goddess Parvathi Devi is worshiped here as Gnanaparasunambikai. It is one of the most famous Shiva temples in South India, and is said to be the site where Kannappa, one of the 63 Saivite Nayanmars, was ready to offer both his eyes to cover blood flowing from the Siva Linga before the Lord Siva stopped him and granted him Mukthi. The inner temple was constructed around 5th century and the outer temple was constructed in the 12th century by the Chola Kings and the Vijaya Nagara kings.
The Shivalinga at Sri Kalahasti is marked by symbols of three creatures — that of a spider at the bottom, a five-hooded snake on top and elephant-tusks on either side. Legend informs us that Sri (spider), Kala (snake) and Hasti (elephant) were cursed by Brahma, Shiva and Parvati but attained moksha by worshipping Lord Shiva here. Hence Shiva came to be called Sri Kalahasteeswara. It is one of the shrines of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams – Shiva Sthalams glorified in the early medieval Thevaram poems by Tamil Saivite Nayanar Sundarar.
This is one of the 276 Devara Paadal Petra Shiva Sthalams and 19th Shiva Sthalam in Thondai Nadu. A lamp burns inside the inner sanctum that constantly flickers despite the lack of air movement inside. Kalahasti is located near the pilgrimage town of Tirupati and is visited by thousands of pilgrims. The river Swarnamukhi takes the northerly course at Sri Kalahasthi almost washing the west wall of the famous Sri Kalahasthi temple. The temple architecture is a treat to the eyes for all those who visit Srikalahasthi.
 
The temple remains open from 5.00 a.m. to 12.00 a.m. and 5.00 p.m. to 9.00 p.m.
Thousands of pilgrims visit this temple to have darshan of the almighty Sri Kalahasteeswara and Sri Gnanaparasunambikai Devi. Sri Kalahasteeswara showers grace to wipe out the sins and obstacles of devotees. Worshipping Sri Kalahasteeswara results in dispelling all worldly miseries and attaining marvelous spiritual happiness. Goddess Gnanaparasunambikai Devi received the Panchakshara mantra from the Lord himself. The Goddess arrived at the place and started her penance here.
Of the nine planets, Kalahasthi importance is attached to Rahu and Ketu (Dragon’s tail and head respectively) those afflicted with the adverse effects of these planets and problems related to snakes, pray for relief here. After fulfillment of the prayers, devotees perform Abhishek to the Lord, offer Vastras (clothes) and also offer donation for the maintenance of the temple depending on their affordability.
Shri Kalahasteeswara Swamy temple is reputed as the Rahu Kethu Kshetra. People who have Rahu Kethu Doshas and Sarpa Doshas, the unmarried, those with children and those who are facing various problems for long period, perform the most effective Rahu – Kethu Sarpa Dosha Nivarana pooja in this temple all, it is believed that the Doshas get removed and desired results occur. Thousands of devotees from the country and abroad perform this pooja and fulfill their vows continuously, after receiving good results.
The temple follows Saivite tradition. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasanthi at 6:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 11:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m and Sayarakshai between 7:45 – 8:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: Alankaram (decoration), neivedhyam (food offering) and Deepa aradhanai (waving of lamps) for both Srikalahasteeswara and Gnana Prasunambika. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 6am – 12 pm and 4-8:30 pm.
Kalahasthi temple is closely attached with the history of Kannappar, whose bhakti (devotion) is yet to be equaled in the history of the religious literature of Tamilnadu. Acharya Shankara had devoted a verse in praise of Kannappar in his celebrated Shivanandalahari. Sekkizhar, in his Periyapuranam elaborately sings the greatness of Kannappar in 185 verses. Kannappar performed abishek to the Lord bringing water from the Swarnamukhi river in his mouth. Vibhuti Prasad is not offered in this temple, but symbolizing the Abishek Theertha of Kannappar, only Theertha Prasad (water) is offered to the devotees mixed with Pachai Karpooram. It is offered through a conch.
The Vibhuti (sacred ash) brought by the devotees are placed at the feet of the Lord, an Arati is offered and returned to the devotee. Abishek is performed to the Lord only with water mixed with Pachai Karpooram. Other Abisheks are offered only to the stage (called Avudayar – the Linga Peetam). As the Shrine is related to Rahu-Ketu planets, devotees do the Pradikshina in an anti-clockwise way. As sage Bharadhwaja performed penance here, only those belonging to the Bharadhwaja Gotra are appointed as archakas in the temple.
The Kavacham covering the Lord has the symbols of the planets, hence there is no separate shrine for the Navagrahas except for Saturn. Garlands are not offered on the body of Lord. An Angi – upper cloth – is placed on the Lord on which Thumba Flower Garland is placed. In the Oddiyanam (belt made of gold studded with pearls and precious stones), of Mother Gnanaparasunambikai, the symbol of planet Kethu is carved. There is a temple for Lord Manikandeswarar on the slopes of the hill through which Kannappar went on the hill taking his Abishek Water from Ponmuhali river.
There is also a mandap called Manikarnika Gattam near this temple carved out of the hill. The story goes that it is here Lord Shiva uttered the Tharaka Mantra to a woman (commonly known as Karna Manthra being uttered on the ears of the departing soul) as Lord Viswanatha did in Kasi – Varanasi to a devotee. Following this tradition, devotees use to bring those nearing their end to Manikarnika Gattam and place them lying here so that the last breath may leave the mortal body through the right ear. Procession of Lord is taken from the North tower entrance. As Maharishis worshipped the Lord facing the east after a dip in the Ponmuhali river, Lord Kalathiappar is facing west to bless the Rishis.
Maha Shivaratri is the most important festival when lakhs of devotees offer prayers to seek the blessings of the Lord. Mahasivarathri Brahmotsavams are celebrated in par with Maha Shivaratri for 13 days during which the Utsava Murtis of Siva and Parvati will be taken on Vahanams in a procession around the temple streets. The fifth day of the festival in the month of Maasi coincides with the Maha Shivaratri. Mahasivarathri, Nandi Seva, Lingodbhavam, Rathotsavam, Theppotsavam and Swami-Ammavarla Kalyanotsavam are the important aspects of this festival. Shivaratri, Vinayaka Chaturthi, Vijayadasami, Thirukarthigai in November-December, Oonjal festival on all Fridays, Makara Sankaranthi (Pongal) in January and Giri Valam on Shivarathri day are the other important festivals celebrated here.
9-30 PM (on Saturday to Monday)
Srikalahasthi:
Srikalahasthi is named after Sri (spider) Kala (Snake) Hasti (Elephant). They were staunch devotees of Lord Shiva. According to Hindu mythology, the elephant or Hasti used to clean the Shiva deity by watering the idol with the help of river-water carried in his trunks and pray for him by placing Vilva leaves. The spider or Sri tried to protect the deity from external damage by weaving his web and to provide shelter for the Shiva lingam. The snake or Kala used to place its precious gem on the Linga to adorn the lord. In this way, they all worshipped the Vayu Linga separately without knowing what the other was doing.
One day, the spider had built a very big and thick web around the deity to protect it from dust and weather while the snake places its gem. The elephant not knowing this and assuming that this form of puja by Sri and Kala is a desecration by the seeming miscreants, pours water on it and cleans it up. This causes a war between the three. The snake punishes the elephant by entering its trunk and in the process, kills itself while the elephant runs amok and hits its trunk and head against the Shiva Linga.
During this struggle, the spider is squashed against the Linga by the elephant’s trunk and the elephant dies due to the snake’s poison. Lord Shiva then appeared and gave moksha to all three of them for their selfless devotion. The spider takes rebirth as a great king while the elephant and the snake reaches heaven for satisfying all its karma. This king continues his good work from his previous birth and builds a variety of temples that seeks to protect the underlying deity with tons of stones.
It is interesting to note that all his temples, keep the deity beyond the access of an elephant. In this temple, access to the deity is through a narrow passage in the side of the building that prevents an elephant from extending its trunk over the lord from any side. This temple is considered as the Kailash of the South or Dakshina Kailasam. At the foot of the Linga one can see a spider, two elephant tusks and a five-headed (the five elements) serpent to remind the devotee of these acts of supreme devotion. The legend here is similar to that of the Jambukeswarar temple at Tiruvanaikkaa.
Vayu Lingam:
During the early days of creation, Lord Vayu performed penance for thousands of years to “Karpoora Lingam” (Karpooram means camphor). Pleased with his penance, Lord Shiva manifested before him and said, ” O Vayu Deva! Though you are dynamic in nature, you stayed here without movement and did penance for me. I’m pleased with your devotion. I shall grant you three boons”. Lord Vayu said, “Swami! I want to be present everywhere in this world. I want to be an integral part of every Jiva who is none other than the manifestation of Paramatma. I want to name this Karpoora Linga, which represents you, after me.
Samba Siva said,” You are qualified for these three boons. As per your wish, you will be spread throughout this world. Without you there will be no life. This Linga of mine will forever be known all over through your name, and all Suras, Asuras, Garuda, Gandharvas, Kinnaras, Kimpurushas, Siddhas, Saadhvis, humans and others will worship this Lingam”. Lord Shiva disappeared after granting these boons. Thereafter, this Karpoora Vayu Lingam is worshipped by all Lokas (worlds).
Gnana Prasunambika Devi:
Once, Parvati was cursed by Lord Shiva to discard her heavenly body and assume the human form. To get rid of the above curse Parvati did a long penance here. Pleased with her deep devotion Lord Shiva again recreated her body – a hundred times better than her previous heavenly body and initiated various mantras including the Panchakshari. Consequent to this, Parvati gained fame and came to be known as Shiva-Gnanam Gnana Prasunamba or Gnana Prasunambika Devi.
Ghanakala prayed to Lord Shiva here:
Cursed to become a ghost, Ghanakala prayed at Srikalahasthi for 15 years and after chanting the Bhairava Mantra many times Lord Shiva restored her original form.
Mayura, Chandra and Devendra prayed to Lord Shiva here:
Mayura, Chandra and Devendra were also freed from their curses after taking bath in the river Swarnamukhi and praying at Srikalahasthi.
Lord Shiva preached to Sage Markandeya here:
To Markandeya, Lord Shiva appeared in Srikalahasthi and preached that a Guru alone could make esoteric teachings and, therefore he is Brahma, Vishnu and Maheswara.
Legends of Kannappa Nayanar:
Kannappa Nayanar was an enthusiastic devotee of Lord Shiva and a hunter by profession. It is believed that once, he saw blood coming out of the eyes of the Lord Shiva. Kannappa plucked out one of his eyes and placed in the eye of Linga which was oozing with blood and tears. When the tears and the blood were still trickling from another eye, Kannappa decided to remove his second eye and placed one of his feet on the spot of the right eye of the Shiva Linga. Before he could pull out his second eye with the arrow, Lord Shiva appeared and restored his eye and for this reason earned the name Kannappan (his original name being Thinnan) and the distinction of having his statue adorn the sanctum. This act of Kannappa placed him among the 63 Nayanmars.
At Sri Kalahasthi, Lord Shiva tested the unshakable devotion of Kannappa Nayanar before the sages gathered at Srikalahasthi. With his divine power, Lord Shiva created a tremor and the roof tops of the temple began to fall. All the sages ran away from the scene except Kannappa who covered the Linga with his body to prevent it from any damage.
According to Swami Sivananda’s book, Sixty-Three Nayanar Saints, some Saivite traditions believe that Kannappa was the reincarnation of Arjuna. Arjuna, worshipped Siva for seeking the Pasupatha Astra and failed to recognize him in the form of a hunter. Thus, according to this tradition, Arjuna had to be born as a hunter and adore the Lord before attaining final liberation.
Flickering Flame in the Hanging Lamp at Sanctum:
In the sanctum sanctorum of this temple is a hanging lamp that always keeps swinging with a flickering flame though there is no visible inlet for wind. No one knows where the wind comes from is a mystery.
Rahu Kethu Parihara Sthalam:
Along with this, Srikalahasthi Temple is also linked with Rahu and Ketu, two of the nine important celestial bodies of Indian astrological system. Many pilgrims visit here to offer their prayers to Rahu and Ketu, considered be immensely powerful.

Lord Shiva has 5 faces; Isanam, Thatpurusham, Vaamadevam, Sathyojaatham and Agoram. There are 5 ancient Shiva temples on the banks of Kosasthalaiyar (Brahmaranya River) representing the 5 faces of Lord Shiva and this is one of them representing the Tatpurusha face of Lord Shiva.
This temple built by Vijayanagara emperor Vidhyaranyar was in a dilapidated state but now it has been renovated beautifully. Kanchipuram Sankara Paramacharya is considered to have spent lot of time here meditating and he is the person who traced this place to Ramayana period findings. This temple was one of the favorites of the Paramacharya, who stayed here for 10 days, and in whose memory a Dhyana Mandapam was constructed. Sri Jayendra Saraswathi and Sri Vijayendra Saraswathi performed the Kumbabhishekam of the temple on June 23, 2002.
The Temple remains open from 06.00 a.m. to 12.30 p.m and 04.00 p.m. to 08.00 p.m.
Shivarathri in February-March, Aipasi Annabishekam in October-November and Tiruvadhirai in December-January are the festivals of the temple. Pradosham days morning 6.00 a.m. to 8.30 p.m. Sani Pradosham is especially important when about 15,000 devotees throng this temple. On the occasion of Maha Shivaratri well over 30,000 devotees wait for the darshan of Pallikondeswarar.
Surutapalli is the place, where Pradosha puja first began. If devotees worship Pallikonda Easwara, who swallowed the venom to save the world on Pradosha day falling on a Saturday, they will recover the losses. Those demoted will be reinstalled in their proper position again with promotion too. Obstacles in wedding proposals will not occur. Separated couples will see re-union in life. Realizing their wishes, devotees perform archanas to Lord Shiva with Vilwa garlands.
 
Origin of Pradosham:
Once Indra, the King of Gods, while riding on his white elephant Iravadha came across Sage Durvasa who offered him a special garland. Indra accepted the garland but without giving much importance he gave it to his elephant. Iravadha was irritated by the smell of the flowers in the garland and therefore threw the garland on the floor and stamped on it. This act enraged sage Durvasa as he got the garland from “Sridevi” as prasadam. Immediately Durvasa cursed Indra and all devas to be bereft of all strength, energy, and fortune.
Due to this curse, in the battles that followed Devas were defeated and Asuras led by Mahabali Chakravarthy, gained control of the universe. Devas sought help from Lord Vishnu who advised them to take the path of diplomacy with Asuras and the only way to regain lost glory was to drink Amrutham/nectar. Devas came to an agreement with asuras to jointly churn the ocean for the nectar of immortality and to share it among them. However, Lord Vishu told Devas that he would ensure Amrutha (Nectar) does not get to Asuras.
During the Samudra Manthan (churning) of the Ocean of Milk Mount Mandaranchal was used as the dasher (churning tool), and Vasuki, the king of serpents, became the churning rope. The gods held the tail of the snake, while the demons (Asuras) held its head, and they pulled on it alternately causing the mountain to rotate, which in turn churned the ocean. However, once the mountain was placed on the ocean, it began to sink. With request from both Devas and Asuras Lord Vishnu took the form of a turtle (Kurma avatar), came to their rescue and supported the mountain on his back.
Halahala Poison was the first to come when churning started and this terrified the Devas and Asuras because, the poison was so toxic that it might have destroyed all of creation. On the advice of Vishnu, both Devas and Asuras approached Shiva for help and protection. Out of compassion for living beings, Shiva drank the poison. It was so potent that it changed the color of Shiva’s neck to blue and therefore he is also called Neelakantha (the blue-necked one, Nila = “blue”, kantha = “throat”). Parvati immediately realized the deeds of Shiva and put her hand to stop the poison from entering Lord Shiva’s body.
After the episode, Shiva proceeded to his abode Kailash with Parvati. On the way, he felt exhausted and slightly uncomfortable, when he reached a place in the bounds of Andhra, which came to be called Suruttuppalli. There, he lied down to relax, keeping his head in the lap of Parvati. The gods, who were concerned about Shiva’s well-being assembled there and stood around him, waiting for the Lord to open his eyes. This lying posture of Shiva is rare and unique, is almost similar to Vishnu’s reclining posture.
As soon as the effect of poison diminished and Lord Shiva came back to normalcy all Devas and Asuras wanted to have his Darshan. When they approach Nandi (Sacred Bull) for permission to see Lord Shiva, Nandi refused and asked them to pray and wait since, Lord Shiva and Parvati were together. On waking up, he found that everyone was happy and feeling relieved since a big disaster was averted.
So, happily, he then began his cosmic dance, Anantha Thandavam, on top of the forehead of Rishaba Vahana accompanied by Devendhran reciting flute, Mahalakshmi singing dance, Brahma playing the jalra, Mahavishnu playing the mridangam in the presence of all the Devars and Rishis. This period when Lord Shiva gave them Darshan is known as Pradosha Kalam. Pradhosha, generally, is a significant occasion observed with great piety at all Siva temples. It is believed that Pradosham is originated here.
Valmikeswarar & Ramalingeswarar:
Sage Valmiki prayed to Lord Rama and the Lord gave him darshan. After defeating Ravana, and before reaching Ayodhya, Rama stayed at this place. So, the two together prayed to Lord Siva. The Lingam, which Valmiki prayed to, is called Valmikeswarar and the one Rama prayed to is Ramalingeswarar. At present these two Lingams face each other.
Lava & Kusa visit to this Temple:
Unknowingly twins Lava and Kusa fought with his father Rama over the Ashwamedha Yaga horse. To get salvation from this they visited many Shiva temples along with Sage Valmiki. This is one of the Temples visited by them.
Pancha Brahma Sthalams:
The river Brahma Aranya was believed to have been created by Lord Brahma. Once when he churned the Arani wood (Arani means fire) to create fire to start the Yagna for Sage Romesa, fire came out initially but on churning further, water came out of it and flown as a river. Since this was created by Lord Brahma from the Arani wood, this is called Brahma Aranya river.
The Brahma Aranya river flows from Andhra Pradesh and merges with sea at Pazhaverkadu. Many sages have meditated at the banks of this river and created many temples. Out of these, in five places they have contained all their meditative powers into Shivalingams and built temples. They are called Pancha Brahma Sthalams, representing the five faces of Lord Shiva and they are:
All these temples are many thousand years old and since they have been created by Sages, the base of the lingam (Avudayar) will be in square shape.
The Temple is located at about 2 Kms from Uthukottai, 2 Kms from Uthukottai Bus Stand, 11 Kms from Nagalapuram, 15 Kms from Ramagiri, 26 Kms from Thiruvallur, 29 Kms from Thiruvallur Railway Station, 74 Kms from Tirupati, 60 Kms from Chennai and 72 Kms from Chennai Airport.

Rahu Kethu Kshetra: Kalahasteeswara temple is famous for Rahu Kethu Kshetra. People with Rahu Ketu dosh and Sarpa Dosh or people with problems with planets cann perform Rahu – Kethu Sarpa Dosha Nivarana Puja in this Temple.
The inner temple was constructed around 5th century by the Pallav dynasty. The Chola kings and the Vijayanagara kings constructed the outer temple in the 12th century. The entire temple is carved out of the side of a huge stone hill. The mandapam with 100 pillars and the 120 feet (37 m) high main gopuram were constructed by Krishnadevaraya, the Vijayanagara king in 1516.
The temple complex abounds in lithic records (stone inscriptions) of Chola kings such as Rajaditya (regnal years 947-949 CE), Raja Raja Chola (regnal years 985-1014 CE), his son Rajendra Chola (1012-1044 CE), his son Rajadhiraja (1018-1054 CE), Kulottunga I (1070-1120 CE) and Kulotunga III (1178-1218 CE).
According to Hindu mythology, the elephant or Hasti used to clean the Shiva deity by watering the idol with the help of river-water carried in his trunks and pray for him by placingBilva leaves. The spider or Sri tried to protect the deity from external damage by weaving his web and to provide shelter for the Shiva lingam. The snake or Kala used to place its precious gem on the linga to adorn the lord. In this way, they all worshipped the Vayu linga separately without knowing what the other was doing.
One day, the spider had built a very big and thick web around the deity to protect it from dust and weather while the snake places its gem. The elephant not knowing this and assuming that this form of puja by Sri and Kala is a desecration by the seeming miscreants, pours water on it and cleans it up. This causes a fight between the three. The snake punishes the elephant by entering its trunk and in the process kills itself while the elephant runs amok and hits its trunk and head against the shiva linga. During this struggle, the spider is squashed against the linga by the elephant’s trunk and the elephant dies due to the snake’s poison. Lord Shiva then appeared and gave moksha to all three of them for their selfless devotion. The spider takes rebirth as a great king while the elephant and the snake reaches heaven for satisfying all its karma.
This king continues his good work from his previous birth and builds a variety of temples that seeks to protect the underlying deity with tons of stones. It is interesting to note that all his temples, keep the deity beyond the access of an elephant. In this temple, access to the deity is through a narrow passage in the side of the building that prevents an elephant from extending its trunk over the lord from any side.

https://www.bharattemples.com/tripura-sundari-temple-gomati-tripura/,"Tripura Sundari Temple, Gomati, Tripura
Tripura Sundari Temple is a Hindu temple of Goddess Tripura Sundari, better known locally as Devi Tripureshwari. The temple is situated in the ancient city of Udaipur, about 55 km from Agartala, Tripura and can be reached by train and road from Agartala. It is believed to be one of the holiest Hindu shrines in this part of the country. Popularly known as Matabari, the shrine is set upon a small hillock, since the shape of a hillock resembles the hump of a tortoise (Kurma) and this shape called Kurmapṛṣṭhākṛti is considered the holiest possible site for a Shakti temple, hence also bestowing the name of Kurma Pīṭha. The Goddess is served by traditional Brahmin priests.
The temple is considered to be one of the 51 Shakti Peethas; legend says that the right leg of Sati fell here. Here, Shakti is worshipped as Tripurasundarī and the accompanying Bhairava is Tripuresh. The main shrine, a cubical edifice with a three-tier roof with a finial, erected by Maharaja of Tripura Dhanya Manikya in 1501 AD, is constructed in the Bengali Ek-ratna style.
There are two similar but different sized black stone idols of the Goddess in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. The larger and more prominent idol of 5 feet height is of Goddess Tripura Sundari and the smaller one, adorably called Chhoto-Ma (literally, Little Mother), is 2 feet tall and is an idol of Goddess Chandi. Folklore says that the smaller idol was carried by the kings of Tripura to the battlefield.
Every year on the occasion of Diwali, a famous Mela takes place near the temple which is visited by more than 0.2 million pilgrims.
Tripura Sundari Temple is one of the holiest Hindu pilgrimage sites in Tripura. The temple is more than 500 years old and is popular for being one of the 51 peethas of Hindus. The locals called it the Matabari. Maharaja Dhanya Manikya built the temple in 1501 AD, at Udaipur, the former capital of Tripura kingdom. The site is believed to be the place where Sati’s right foot fell.
According to the legend Maharaja Dhanya Manikya was instructed in his dream to install goddess Tripura Sundari in the temple that stood at the edge of Udaipur town. A temple already stood at the small hilltop, but it was dedicated to Lord Vishnu. The king was amused by it. But he had the same dream again the next night. The king did as he was instructed and the temple came into being.
This ‘pithasthan’ (centre of pilgrimage) is also known as Kurma Pith because the shape of the temple premises resembles that of “Kurma” or tortoise. The idol of ‘Maa Kali’, presiding deity of the temple, stands in the sanctum sanctorum and it is made of reddish black stone, popularly known in Bengali as ‘Kashtipathar’.
The Goddess ‘Kali’ is worshipped in her incarnation as ‘Shoroshi’ (sixteen year old girl) in the temple by professional priests. An idol of smaller size of Maa Kali called ‘Chotto Maa’who stands beside the presiding deity used to be reportedly carried along by the kings during hunting expeditions and also during war for impromptu worship in tents. The temple consists of square type sanctum of the typical Bengali hut structure with a conical dome.

Legend / Local stories
Legend has it that King Dhanya Manikya, who ruled over Tripura in the closing years of the 15th century, had a revelation one night in a dream in which Goddess Tripura Sundari instructed him to initiate her worship on the hilltop near the town of Udaipur, the contemporary capital of the kingdom. The king found out that a temple on the hillock was already dedicated to Lord Vishnu. He was in a dilemma, unable to decide how a temple dedicated to Vishnu could have an idol of Shakti. The following night, the divine vision was repeated. The king understood that Vishnu and Shakti were different forms of the same Supreme Deity (Brahman). Thus, the temple of Tripura Sundari came into being around the year 1501 AD. In the dawn of this century, the temple has crossed 500 years. This legend is recounted as an example of solidarity between two sub-groups of Hinduism: the Vaishnava and the Shakta sects.

The location of the temple is about 8 kilometers away from the main city of Agartala which is the capital of the state of Tripura in India. The temple was dedicated to the Chaturdasha Devata which means fourteen deities. The temple was built by King Krishna Manikya Debbarma who was the ruler of Tripura at that time.
he temple is fondly called the Chaudda Devata Mandir. The fourteen deities worshipped at the Chaturdasha temple Tripura are called Burasa, Lampra, Bikhatra, Akhatra, Thumnairok, Sangroma, Bonirok, Twima, Songram, Mwtaikotor, Mailuma, Noksumwtai, Swkalmwtai and Khuluma in Kokborok.

These deities and the gods they represent have completely influenced the people of this state which is called the country of fourteen gods and goddesses. People from the neighboring states also come here in large numbers every year to pray for peace, happiness and prosperity.
Tripura is called the land of the fourteen gods. As per legend and the description in the royal chronicles regarding Chaturdasha temple history, king Tripur was killed by Lord Shiva because of his irreligious acts and conduct. Harabati, the widow of Tripur, had gone to bathe in the river when she saw the fourteen gods being chased by a wild buffalo and taking refuge on a cotton tree. Harbati helped the gods to kill the wild buffalo and save themselves. The fourteen gods and goddesses were so pleased with Harabati that they came to stay in the royal palace at Udaipur and were worshipped there. The sacrifice of a wild buffalo at the Kharchi festival has come down as a tradition since then.
The city of Udaipur fell to Muslim invaders under the command of Samser Gaji. The Muslim invaders occupied the city, and the Tripuri king had to shift his capital to Agartala on the banks of the river Haora. It is said that when King Krishna Manikya Debbarma set up a new capital at Agartala after leaving his original capital Udaipur behind, the gods and goddesses also wanted to leave the place and come with him to his new adobe. The king took their request to heart and brought them to Agartala and installed them at the newly built temple.
The King installed the heads of the fourteen deities he had worshipped in Udaipur. All idols were originally made of alloy. When one of the heads got washed away while being bathed in the river, it was replaced by a head made of silver. The temple that he had built for the fourteen deities had a flat roof that was similar to the architecture followed in Bengal at that time but has two domes that taper upwards like Buddhist stupas. The one at the back is higher than the one at the front.

While the site’s rock carvings, murals with primitive beauty form the chief attraction, the natural environment, mountain scenery and waterfalls are an added attraction. As per Hindu theological traditions, when Lord Shiva was going to Kashi along with one crore gods and goddesses including him, he made a night halt at this location. He asked all the gods and goddesses to wake up before sun rise and proceed for Kashi. It is said that in the morning, except Shiva himself, no one else could get up so set out for Kashi himself cursing the others to become stone images. As a result, we have one less than a crore stone images and carvings at Unakoti. These carvings are located at a landscaped forest area with green vegetation all around.
There is also another story that suggests about a blacksmith who wished to live with Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati on the Kailash Mountain.

When counted in the morning, the idols were one less than a koti (crore). This made the name of the place be changed to Unakoti, literally meaning one less than a crore.
The former princely state of Tripura was ruled by Maharajas of Manikya dynasty.

https://www.bharattemples.com/sheetala-maata-chaukiya-jaunpur/,"The temple of Ma Sheetla Chaukiya Devi is quite old. The worship of Shiv and Shakti has been going on since times immemorial. History states that, during the era of Hindu kings, the governance of Jaunpur was in the hands of Ahir rulers. Heerchand Yadav is considered the first Aheer ruler of Jaunpur. The descendants of this clan used to surname ‘Ahir’. These people built forts at Chandvak and Gopalpur. It is believed that the temple of Chaukiya Devi was built in the glory of their clan-deity either by the Yadavs or the Bhars– but in view of the predilections of the Bhars, it seems more logical to conclude that this temple was built by the Bhars. The Bhars were non-Aryans. The worship of Shiv and Shakti was prevalent in the non-Armyans. The Bhars held power in Jaunpur. At first, the Devi must have been installed on a praised platform or ‘chaukiya’ and probably because of this she was referred to as Chaukia Devi. Devu Sheetla is the representative blissful aspect of the Divine Mother: hence she was called Sheetla. On Mondays and Fridays, worshippers come here in quite large numbers. Huge crowds gather here during the Navratris.

Kashi Vishvanath Temple is one of the most famous Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is located in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India. The temple stands on the western bank of the holy river Ganga, and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest of Shiva temples. The main deity is known by the name Vishvanatha or Vishveshvara meaning Ruler of The Universe. Varanasi city is also called Kashi, and hence the temple is popularly called Kashi Vishvanath Temple. Its name originally was Visvheshvara (broken down Vishwa: Universe, Ish: Lord; Vara: Excellent) or Lord of the Universe.
The temple has been referred to in Hindu scriptures for a very long time as a central part of worship in Shaiva philosophy. It has been destroyed and re-constructed a number of times in history. The last structure was demolished by Aurangzeb, the sixth Mughal emperor who constructed the Gyanvapi Mosque on its site. The current structure was built on an adjacent site by the Maratha ruler, Ahilya Bai Holkar of Indore in 1780.
Since 1983, the temple has been managed by the government of Uttar Pradesh. During the religious occasion of Shivratri, Kashi Naresh (King of Kashi) is the chief officiating priest.
The temple complex consists of a series of smaller shrines, located in a small lane called the Vishwanatha Galli, near the river. The linga of the main deity at the shrine is 60 cm tall and 90 cm in circumference housed in a silver altar.The main temple is quadrangle and is surrounded by shrines of other gods. There are small temples for Kaalbhairav, Dhandapani, Avimukteshwara, Vishnu, Vinayaka, Sanishwara, Virupaksha and Virupaksh Gauri in the complex. There is a small well in the temple called the Jnana Vapi also spelled as Gyaan vapi (the wisdom well). The Jnana Vapi well sites to the north of the main temple and it is believed that the Jyotirlinga was hidden in the well to protect it at the time of the invasion. It is said that the main priest of the temple jumped in the well with the Shiv Ling in order to protect the Jyotirlinga from invaders.
According to the structure of the temple, there is a Sabha Griha or Congregation Hall leading to the inner Garbha Griha or Sanctum Sanctorum. The venerable Jyotirlinga is a dark brown coloured stone that is enshrined in the Sanctum, placed on a silver platform. The structure of the Mandir is composed of three parts. The first comprises a spire on the Mandir of Lord Vishwanath or Mahadeva. The second is a gold dome and the third is the gold spire atop Lord Vishwanath carrying a flag and a trident.
The Kashi Vishwanath temple receives around 3,000 visitors every day. On certain occasions, the numbers reach 1,000,000 and more. Noteworthy about the temple is the 15.5-metre high gold spire and gold dome. There are three domes each made up of pure gold.

The temple has been mentioned in the Puranas including the Kashi Khanda (section) of Skanda Purana. The original Vishwanath temple was destroyed by the army of Qutb-ud-din Aibak in 1194 CE when he defeated the Raja of Kannauj as a commander of Mohammad Ghori. The temple was rebuilt by a Gujarati merchant during the reign of Delhi’s Sultan Iltutmish (1211-1266 CE). It was demolished again during the rule of either Hussain Shah Sharqi (1447-1458) or Sikandar Lodhi (1489-1517). Raja Man Singh built the temple during Mughal emperor Akbar’s rule, but orthodox Hindus boycotted it as he had let the Mughals marry within his family. Raja Todar Mal further re-built the temple with Akbar’s funding at its original site in 1585.

In 1669 CE, Emperor Aurangzeb destroyed the temple and built the Gyanvapi Mosque in its place. The remains of the erstwhile temple can be seen in the foundation, the columns and at the rear part of the mosque.
In 1742, the Maratha ruler Malhar Rao Holkar made a plan to demolish the mosque and reconstruct Vishweshwar temple at the site. However, his plan did not materialize, partially because of intervention by the Nawabs of Lucknow, who controlled the territory. Around 1750, the Maharaja of Jaipur commissioned a survey of the land around the site, with the objective of purchasing land to rebuild the Kashi Vishwanath temple.[7]:85 However, his plan to rebuild the temple did not materialize either. In 1780, Malhar Rao’s daughter-in-law Ahilyabai Holkar constructed the present temple adjacent to the mosque. In 1828, Baiza Bai, widow of the Maratha ruler Daulat Rao Scindhia of Gwalior State, built a low-roofed colonnade with over 40 pillars in the Gyan Vapi precinct.[8] During 1833-1840 CE, the boundary of Gyanvapi Well, the ghats and other nearby temples were constructed.A 7-feet high stone statue of Nandi bull, gifted by the Raja of Nepallies to the east of the colonnade. Many noble families from various ancestral kingdoms of Indian subcontinent and their prior establishments make generous contributions for the operations of the temple. In 1841, the Bhosales of Nagpur donated silver to the temple. In 1835, Maharaja Ranjit Singh donated 1 tonne of gold for plating the temple’s dome.
The temple was managed by a hereditary group of pandas or mahants. After the death of Mahant Devi Dutt, a dispute arose among his successors. In 1900, his brother-in-law Pandit Visheshwar Dayal Tewari filed a lawsuit, which resulted in him being declared the head priest.

https://www.bharattemples.com/krishna-janmasthan-temple-complex-mathura-uttar-pradesh/,"Krishna Janmasthan Temple Complex, Mathura, Uttar Pradesh
The Krishna Janmasthan Temple Complex is a group of Hindu temples in Mallapura, Mathura, Uttar Pradesh, India. These temples are built around the place where major Hindu deity Krishna is said to have been born. The place holds religious significance since the 6th century BC. The temples were destroyed multiple times throughout history, latest by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1670 who erected Eidgah there. In 20th century, the new temple complex was built with financial help from industrialists containing the Keshavdeva temple, the Garbha Griha temple at the birth place and the Bhagavata Bhavan.
Mathura fell under British control in 1803. The East India Company auctioned the land of Katra and it was purchased by Raja Patnimal, a wealthy banker of Banaras.Raja Patnimal wanted to build the temple but could not do so. His descendants inherited the land of Katra. His descendant Raj Krishna Das was challenged, for the ownership of 13.37 acres of land on which the shrine and the Eidgah is situated, in two civil suits by the Muslims of Mathura but the Allahabad High Court ruled in favour of Raj Krishna Das in both suits in 1935.Kailashnath Katju and Madanmohan Chaturvedi had helped in lawsuits. Politician and educationist Madan Mohan Malaviya acquired the land from Raj Krishna Das on 7 February 1944 at the cost of Rs. 13000 with financial help of Industrialist Jugal Kishore Birla.Following death of Malaviya, Jugal Kishore Birla formed a trust named Shri Krishna Janmabhoomi Trust, later registered as the Shri Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sansthan, on 21 February 1951 and acquired the land. Jugal Kishore Birla entrusted the construction of the new temple with another industrialist and philanthropist Jaidayal Dalmia. The construction of the temple complex was started in October 1953 with leveling of lands and completed in February 1982. His eldest son Vishnu Hari Dalmiasucceeded him and served on the Trust until his death. His grandson Anurag Dalmia is Joint Managing Trustee on the Trust. The construction was funded by other business families including Ramnath Goenka. In 1968, the Trust and the Shahi Eidgah committee reached an agreement which granted the temple land to the Trust and the management of the Eidgah to the Eidgah committee as well no legal claim of the Trust on the Eidgah.Following the demolition of the Babri Mosque in 1992, Manohar Lal Sharma, a resident of Vrindavan, has filed a petition in the Mathura District Court challenging the 1968 agreement as well as a petition to quash the Places of Religious Worship Act of 1991 which preserves the status quo as on 15 August 1947 for all places of worship
According to Hindu traditions, Krishna was born to Devaki and Vasudeva in a prison cell where they were confined by his maternal uncle Kansa, a king of Mathura, due to prophecy of his death by the child of Devaki. According to tradition, a temple dedicated to Krishna was built the birthplace by his great grandson Vajranabh. The present site known as Krishna Janmasthan (lit. birthplace of Krishna) was known as Katra (lit. market place) Keshavdeva.[5] The archeological excavations of the site had revealed pottery and terracotta from 6th century BC.[5]It also produced some Jain sculptures as well as a large Buddhist complex including Yasha Vihara, a monastery, belonging to Gupta period (c. 400).[5] Cunningham opined that Hindus may have occupied the former Buddhist site.[3] The Vaishnava temple may have erected on the place as early as the first century. Some late 8th century inscriptions mentions donations to the sie by the Rashtrakutas. In 1017 or 1018, Mahmud of Ghazni attacked and plundered Mahaban. Ghazni’s scribe, though not accompanying him on the expedition, Al Utbi describes in his Tarikh-i-Yamini neighbouring holy town which is identified as Mathura. He wrote, “In the centre of the city there was a huge and magnificent temple, which the people believed wasn’t built by men but by the angels… Any description of the temple, either in words or in pictures, would fall short and fail to convey its beauty.” Mahmud of Ghazni wrote, “if any one wished to construct a building equal to it, he would not be able to do so without spending a hundred million dinars, and the work would occupy two hundred years, even though the most able and experienced workmen were employed.” He ordered to burn all the temples and demolish them. He plundered gold and silver idols and carried away a load of hundred camels.A stone inscription in Sanskrit found from the site mentions that in Vikrama Samvat 1207 (1150) a person named Jajja who may have been a vassal of Gahadavala king built a Vishnu temple which was ‘brilliantly white and touching the clouds’.Vaishnava saints Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Vallabhacharya visited Mathura in early 16th century.
Abdullah, in the reign of Mughal emperor Jehangir, mentions in Tarikh-i-Daudi the destruction of Mathura and its temples by Delhi SultanSikandar Lodi in 16th century. Lodi had prohibited Hindus from bathing in the river and shaving of heads on the banks as well. In the reign of Jehangir, in 1618, Raja Veer Singh Deva Bundela of Orchha had built a temple at the cost of thirty-three lakhs. A French traveller Tavernier visited Mathura in 1650 and had described the octagonal temple built in red sand stone.Italian traveller Niccolao Manucci who worked in Mughal court has also described the temple. Mughal prince Dara Shikoh had patronised the temple and donated a railing to the temple. The railing was removed Mathura governor Abdun Nabi Khan on the order of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb and he built Jama mosque on the ruins of the Hindu temples. During the Jat rebellion in Mathura, Abdul Nabi Khan was killed in 1669.Aurangzeb attacked Mathura and destroyed that Keshavdeva temple in 1670 and built Shahi Eidgah in its place.

For the raja bhoga offering, Radha Ramans pujaris first offer all of the bhoga (food) to Radha-Raman and the shalagrama shilas, and then they make a second offering to Srimati Radharani, and then a third offering for Gopal Bhatta Goswami. There are not three different plates, but the same plate is offered in the order above. The fires for cooking in the temple kitchen have been burning continuously for over 440 years, since the Deity was installed.

https://www.bharattemples.com/banke-bihari-temple-mathura-uttar-pradesh/,"Banke Bihari Temple, Mathura, Uttar Pradesh
Shri Bankey Bihari Mandir is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Krishna, in the holy city of Vrindavan in the Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh. It is situated near Shri RadhaVallabh Temple.This temple is among the 7 temples of Thakur of Vrindavan including Shri Radha Vallabh Ji, Shri Govind Dev Ji, Shri Radha Raman Ji, Shri Radha Madhav Ji, Shri Madan Mohan Ji and Shri Gopinath Ji. Bankey Bihari Ji was originally worshipped at Nidhivana. Bankey means “bent in three places” and Bihari means “supreme enjoyer.” The image of Lord Krishna stands in the Tribhanga posture. Haridas Swami originally worshipped this devotional image under the name of Kunj-Bihari (“Enjoyer of Lakes”).
“I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, round whose neck is swinging a garland of flowers beautified with the moon-locket, whose two hands are adorned with the flute and jewelled ornaments, who always revels in pastimes of love, whose graceful threefold-bending form of Śyāmasundara is eternally manifest.
Bankey Bihari Temple was established by Swami Haridas (Lalita Sakhi in Dvapara Yuga),a guru of the famous singer Tansen. Once on the request of his disciples Swami Haridas ji sang the following verse in Nidhivan in Vrindavan “Mai ri sahaj jori pragat bhai ju rang ki gaur syam ghan damini jaisen. Pratham hun ahuti ab hun aagen hun rahihai na tarihai taisain.. Ang ang ki ujraii sugharaii chaturaii sunderta aisain.. Shri Haridas ke swami syama kunjbihari sam vais vaisain..” On singing the verse, the Celestial couple Shyama-Shyam (Radha Krishna) appeared in front of him and his devotees. On the request of Shri Swami ji the couple merged into one and the idol of Banke bihari appeared there (the same idol seen in the temple). The idol was established in Nidhivan.
The image of Bihariji installed in Shri Bankey Bihari Mandir, is the one granted to Swami Haridas by the celestial couple Shyama-Shyam themselves. Submitting to the desire of devotees, The Lord appeared in person with his divine consort and left back a black charming image before disappearing.
Swami Haridas was born to Shri Ashudhir and his wife Srimati Gangadevi on the day of Radha Ashtami i.e. eighth day of second (bright) fortnight of Bhadrapad month of the year 1535 Vikrami (1478 A.D.). He was born in a small village, now known as Haridaspur, near Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh. The lineage of the family can be traced back to Shri Gargacharya. Shri Gargachrya was the Kulaguru (family guru) of Yadavas and visited Brij secretly for conducting the Namakarana Samskara (naming ceremony) of young Krishna and Balarama on request of Sri Vasudeva. A branch of the family migrated to Multan (now in Pakistan), but some of them returned after a long time. Sri Ashudhir was one such migrant who after returning from Multan settled at the outskirts of Brij, near Aligarh.
Swami Haridas was the reincarnation of Lalita ‘sakhi’ (female friend), of the inner consortium of Lord Krishna. This easily explains the fact that even in his childhood, he was more into meditation and scriptures, while other children of his age were busy playing. He was married at the suitable age according to the time to Harimati. Even after his marriage, young Haridas stayed away from worldly pleasures and concentrated on meditation. Harimatiji was such a saintly soul herself that on realizing the inclination of her husband, she prayed intensely and was bodily transported to the heavenly abode of Lord by entering the flame of a small lamp in the presence of Haridas. No physical remains were left behind.
Soon after that Haridas left his village for Vrindavan, which was a dense forest at that time and chose a secluded spot, which is now known as Nidhivan, to practice his music and to enjoy eternal bliss of meditation. He constantly and continuously meditated on Nitya Ras and Nitya Bihar of Lord at Nitya Vrindavan. His way of Sadhna was to compose and sing songs in the praise of Lord. While on earth, living in a mortal state, he facilitated his regular unobstructed entry in the Nitya Bihar and always enjoyed the pleasure of closeness of Lord. He chose a secluded and densely forested area, Kunj, in Nidhivan as his gateway to the nirvana and was mostly sitting there, singing, meditating and surfing in the ocean of eternal bliss.
His disciples were curious about this place and one day with permission of Swamiji, they all entered the kunj. But instead of seeing anything they were almost blinded by bright, intense light, which seemed to fill the whole place. On knowing of their plight Swamiji himself went there, and then after his requests, the lord appeared in person with his divine consort, pleasantly smiling and in a playful mood and casting a spell of charm on every living being present there. Those who witnessed this, were so spell bounded by the beauty of the Lord and his consort, that they couldn’t even blink their eyes; it seemed that all of them had turned into stone statues.
The legend as handed down to the generations of Goswamis, says that the beauty of the divine couple was such that no one wanted to lose the sight and proximity of divinity, but then what kind of divinity is it, which cannot make a mere mortal swoon and charmed enough to forget and give up the world and its luxuries? The beauty of the divine couple was so much that lesser mortals, like you and me, won’t be able to bear such a heavenly beauty. Sensing this Swami Haridasji requested both of them to take a single form, as the world won’t be able to bear their image. He requested them to take a single form like Ghan (cloud) and Damini (lightning), thus giving a perfect metaphor to the combined beauty of dark Lord and his fair consort, Radhaji.
Also he wanted his beloved lord to be in front of his eyes always. Granting him his both wishes, the couple turned itself into one single black charming idol, the same one that you see in the temple today. The charm and beauty of Shri Bankey Bihariji is the only reason why the ‘darshan’ in the temple is never continuous but is broken by thel curtain drawn on him regularly. It is also said that if one stares long enough into the eyes of Shri Bankey Bihariji, the person would lose his self-consciousness.
Thus came into existence the physical form of Lord Bankey Bihari, popularly known as Bihariji. The responsibility of Sewa of Bihariji was handed over to Goswami Jagannath by Swamiji himself. Goswami Jagannath was one of the principal disciple and younger brother of Swamiji. By tradition, the Sewa is performed by descendents of Jagannath Goswami till day.
Initially, the deity was installed in a temple close to the first appearance in Nidhivan. A new temple befitting the glory of Bihariji was constructed in 1862 AD. Goswamis themselves mobilized resources for the construction. The temple is an architectural beauty in itself and follows the contemporary Rajasthani style.
The sewa of the Bihariji is unique in its own way. It is performed in three parts every day i.e. Shringar, Rajbhog and Shayan. While shringar (which includes bath, dressing and adornment with jewellery like crown and necklaces) and Rajbhog(feast) is offered in the forenoon, Shayan Sewa (shayan means sleep) is offered in the evening. The temple doesn’t have a tradition of Mangala (early morning) sewa. Swami Haridas did not favour Mangla Sewa as he wanted his child like Lord to take complete rest and did not want to disturb him out of deep slumber so early in the morning.
So, the temple today stands with its full glory, inside which the Lord himself resides. It is thronged by thousands of visitors everyday. Many of saints visits the temple. Sadguru Sri Mata Amritanandamayi Devi(AMMA) from Kerala visited the temple on 2016. Amma’s entire tour group(more than 3000 people) joined Amma for the visit to the always-crowded temple. The already sanctified space reverberated and pulsed with devotion as Amma entered the temple and gazed at the murti of Sri Krishna. Before leaving, Amma participated in a ceremonial worship of the Lord. The temple’s priest welcomed Amma as an honored guest and presented her with ceremonial shawls, garlands and the same type of flute that was played by Sri Krishna.

https://www.bharattemples.com/ram-janmabhoomi-ayodhya-uttar-pradesh/,"Ram Janmabhoomi, Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh
 
Ram Janmabhoomi is the name given to the site that many Hindus believe to be the birthplace of Rama, the 7th avatar of the Hindu deity Vishnu. The Ramayana states that the location of Rama’s birthplace is on the banks of the Sarayu river in a city called “Ayodhya”. A section of Hindus claim that the exact site of Rama’s birthplace is where the Babri Masjidonce stood in the present-day Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh. According to this theory, the Mughals demolished a Hindu shrine that marked the spot, and constructed a mosque in its place. People opposed to this theory state that such claims arose only in the 18th century, and that there is no evidence for the spot being the birthplace of Rama.
The political, historical and socio-religious debate over the history and location of the Babri Mosque, and whether a previous temple was demolished or modified to create it, is known as the Ayodhya dispute.
In 1992, the demolition of Babri Masjid by Hindu nationalists triggered widespread Hindu-Muslim violence. Since then, the archaeological excavations have indicated the presence of a temple beneath the mosque rubble.Several other sites, including places in other parts of India, Afghanistan, and Nepal, have been proposed as birthplaces of Rama.
The Ramayana, a Hindu epic whose earliest portions date back to 1st millennium BCE, states that the capital of Rama was Ayodhya.According to the local Hindu belief, the site of the now-demolished Babri Mosque in Ayodhya is the exact birthplace of Rama. The Babri mosque is believed to have been constructed during 1528-29 by a certain ‘Mir Baqi’ (possibly Baqi Tashqandi), who was a commander of the Mughalemperor Babur (r. 1526–1530).However, the historical evidence for these beliefs is scant.
In 1611, an English traveller William Finch visited Ayodhya and recorded the “ruins of the Ranichand castle and houses”. He made no mention of a mosque. In 1634, Thomas Herbert described a “pretty old castle of Ranichand [Ramachand]” which he described as an antique monument that was “especially memorable”. However, by 1672, the appearance of a mosque at the site can be inferred because Lal Das’s Awadh-Vilasa describes the location of birthplace without mentioning a temple or “castle”. In 1717, the Moghul Rajput noble Jai Singh IIpurchased land surrounding the site and his documents show a mosque.The Jesuit missionary Joseph Tiefenthaler, who visited the site between 1766-1771, wrote that either Aurangazeb (r. 1658–1707) or Babur had demolished the Ramkot fortress, including the house that was considered as the birthplace of Rama by Hindus. He further stated that a mosque was constructed in its place, but the Hindus continued to offer prayers at a mud platform that marked the birthplace of Rama.[8] In 1810, Francis Buchanan visited the site, and stated that the structure destroyed was a temple dedicated to Rama, not a house. Many subsequent sources state that the mosque was constructed after demolishing a temple.
Police officer and writer Kishore Kunal states that all the claimed inscriptions on the Babri mosque were fake. They were affixed sometime around 1813 (almost 285 years after the supposed construction of the mosque in 1528 AD), and repeatedly replaced.
Before the 1940s, the Babri Masjid was called Masjid-i-Janmasthan (“mosque of the birthplace”), including in the official documents such as revenue records. Shykh Muhammad Azamat Ali Kakorawi Nami (1811–1893) wrote: “the Babari mosque was built up in 923(?) A.H. under the patronage of Sayyid Musa Ashiqan in the Janmasthan temple in Faizabad-Avadh, which was a great place of (worship) and capital of Rama’s father”
H.R. Neville, the editor of the Faizabad District Gazetteer (1870), wrote that the Janmasthan temple “was destroyed by Babur and replaced by a mosque.” He also wrote “The Janmasthan was in Ramkot and marked the birthplace of Rama. In 1528 A.D. Babur came to Ayodhya and halted here for a week. He destroyed the ancient temple and on its site built a mosque, still known as Babur’s mosque. The materials of the old structure [i.e., the temple] were largely employed, and many of the columns were in good preservation.

https://www.bharattemples.com/prayag-madhav-temple-varanasi/,"Kashi Khand has attached a great importance to bathing in Prayag Teerth.  Prayag Teerth, as such, is not in existence but this falls within the larger area of Dasaswamedh.
One point needs to be mentioned here to make things clear.  At the time when Skanda Puran was conceived by Bhagwan Ved Vyas and when the Puran was actually written, there were only five bathing places in Ganga at Varanasi, which had a great religious importance, namely Assi, Dasaswamedh, Manikarnika, Panchganga and Varuna.  Even today, South Indian pilgrims who visit Varanasi, for their Kashi Yatra, perform Shraddha Karma at the above five Ghats.   Over a period of several centuries, many Ghats have come up in the name of many Kings or the Royal families, etc.  Religiously speaking, Dasaswamedh extends to a very wide area in the river Ganga and may include several new Ghats in its fold.
Therefore, Prayag Teerth as mentioned in Kashi Khand is a part of Dasaswamedh. Devotees may consider both as synonymous.  Great importance has been attached to taking bath in the above Teerth in Magh Month and worshipping Prayag Madhav.  Persons doing so, will be blessed with wealth, food grains, happy family and will attain Moksha.
Prayag Madhav is located at D.17/111, in the premises of Ram Mandir at Dasaswamedh Ghat. Some people also call it Dharani Varaha (Ref: Varanasi Vaibhav by Pt. Kuber Nath Sukul). Devotees can travel upto Dasaswamedh Ghat in a rickshaw.

https://www.bharattemples.com/vishwakameshwar-temple-varanasi/,"Long time back, there was a boy called Vishwakarma who stayed in the Gurukul (residential school) for his education. As was the practice, a student was required to carry on domestic chores and do service to his Guru (Teacher), Guru Patni (Teacher’s wife) and their family.
Once the teacher asked Vishwakarma to construct a shelter which should never become old. Teacher’s wife asked him to stitch one dress for her without using any cloth. The dress should neither be big nor small. The teacher’s son asked Vishwakarma to prepare one slipper which should not be made of leather and it should be convenient for the wearer to run very fast in water. The teacher’s daughter asked him to prepare one pair of golden ear tops. Further, he was asked to prepare girls’ play things made of ivory. There were several such demands from the Teacher’s family. The demands went on increasing from all quarters.
Vishwakarma was flabbergasted. In those days, respect to Guru was accorded highest priority and any refusal or disrespect was viewed seriously. Vishwakarma left the Guru’s house without telling anyone and reached a forest, not knowing what had to be done. In due course, he came across an ascetic and he fell at the latter’s feet. Vishwakarma narrated his woes to the ascetic, who told him to go to Kashi and worship Lord Visweshwar. Since Vishwakarma did not know the way to Kashi, the ascetic offered to take him there.
Both of them reached Kashi and the ascetic took leave of Vishwakarma. Some intuition told Vishwakarma that the ascetic was none other than Lord Shiva. Vishwakarma soon installed a Shiv Ling and started worshipping Lord Shiva intensively for several years. At last Lord Shiva appeared before him and granted him a divine wish. Vishwakarma told him of his woes pertaining to his teacher and his family.
Lord Shiva was highly pleased with the veneration that Vishwakarma had for his Guru. He blessed the latter with all the divine powers which will enable him (Vishwakarma) to produce/make/manufacture various machineries, weapons, idols, necklaces and all other things which are needed by mankind. By the divine powers, Vishwakarma would also be able to construct various temples/buildings and beautify existing temples/palaces etc.
Vishwakarma was extremely happy with Lord Shiva’s generosity. Lord Shiva also stated that the devotees who worship the Ling installed by Vishwakarma will attain Moksha. Lord Shiva further stated, he will be available in the Ling which is called Vishwakarmeshwar and devotees will always be blessed by the Lord. (Kashi Khand, Chapter 86). The above chapter in Kashi Khand also speaks about the respect which students should have for their teachers.
Vishwakarma later on became the celestial architect. Even today, Vishwakarma Jayanti is celebrated in North India and Bengal and on this day all factories remain closed. The workers perform pooja of machinery and other tools/equipments etc. and give a respite to their tools. Vishwakarma’s idol is installed at various places/workshops and after pooja/archana etc. the idol is immersed in the Ganges/River.

In Chapter 26, this area is described to contain the Avimukta Kshetra, housing Visweshwar Temple. Further, Lord Shiva has described the area coming under Pancha Krosha as very dear to him. The importance of this area has been amply described in various other Purans also.
Kashi Khand, in Chapter 100 has prescribed various Yatras (religious tours like Shiva Ling Yatras, Ekadasa (eleven) Ling Yatras, Antargrihi Yatra, Gauri Yatra, Surya Yatra, Bhairava Yatra, Vishnu Yatra etc.
One important Yatra being undertaken by the religious devotees in and around Kashi is the Pancha Krosha Yatra which takes a circumambulation around Kashi Kshetra. This tour involves about five days and devotees worship 128 deities on the way. The tour is indeed tedious and to avoid hardship, people undertake this tour by car or other conveyance to finish the trip in one day.
Pancha Krosha Yatra, per se, has not been mentioned in Kashi Khand, though this finds mention in other Purans like Brahma Vaivart Puran (Kashi Rahasya), Koorma Puran etc. However, local devotees hold Pancha Krosha Yatra in high esteem and it is reckoned with almost synonymous with Kashi Khand. Therefore, the compiler is pleased to write about this.
There are various religious groups undertaking this Yatra. Experienced seniors sometimes lead the group of people or they depend on some people to take them around the various places.
For those who are not in a position to undertake the extensive tour (for reasons like physical strain, lack of time etc.), there is one Pancha Krosha Temple in Kashi where all the 128 deities are available in miniature form. The Shiv Ling is supposed to be made of sphatik stone (crystal stone) with both Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvaty’s symbolic presence.

https://www.bharattemples.com/ratneshwar-temple-varanasi/,"Lord Shiva and his consort Goddess Parvaty were happily ensconsed in the Holy City of Kashi, blessing all their devotees. Goddess Parvaty’s father was Giri Raj Himavan. (Giri means Mountain, Raj means King and Himavan is Himalaya Mountains).Once Giri Raj’s wife (Goddess Parvaty’s mother) told Giri Raj that a long time has passed but there had been no news about the welfare of their daughter Parvaty. Giri Raj also felt the separation from his daughter unbearable. He felt as if he was sitting on burning fire. He decided to visit Kashi to see his daughter.

As is customary, whenever a father visits his daughter in her husband’s house, the father generally carries with him lots of gifts. Accordingly, Giri Raj carried with him abundant dresses and Ratnas (precious stones). Kashi Khand states the number of precious stones as 8000 Grams of Pearls, 1000 Grams diamonds, and a similar or larger quantity of other stones like corals, emarald, sapphire etc.
He reached Kashi and was astounded to see the beauty of the city. He naturally felt his daughter must be quite happy staying here and he was pleased with his fortune. Giri Raj asked a devotee in Kashi the directions to reach his daughter Uma’s house. The devotee praised Goddess and stated that a person who devoutly prays Uma even by uttering these words through his mouth is blessed by Lord Visweshwar.
The devotee further stated that Lord Visweshwar and Goddess Uma (Parvaty) are staying in a very huge Palace befitting the status of an emperor and that the palace has been constructed under the supervision of celestial architect Viswakarma. The devotee went on describing the beauty of the palace where the pillars have been beautified with various kinds of precious stones with beautiful paintings on the wall etc. On hearing the description of the palace, Giri Raj was astounded. The devotee also told Giri Raj that Lord Visweshwara was freely distributing his wealth to needy persons.
When Giri Raj heard about the greatness of Lord Visweshwara, his generosity and the attractive beauty of his palace, he (Giri Raj) felt ashamed and thought that the huge quantities of Ratnas (precious stones) brought by him as a gift for his daughter were no match for what was possessed by Lord Visweshar. By that time it was evening.
Before sunrise the next day, he took bath in Panch Nada Teerth (present Panchganga Ghat), worshipped Kaal Bhairav and after leaving all the precious stones nearby, left for his abode. The Ratnas which he had left as a heap, grouped together and took the form of a Ling.
Soon thereafter, Lord Visweshwar and Goddess Parvathy visited the place where the Ling had formed itself. Lord Visweshwar knew by his divine vision as to what had happened. He praised Giri Raj for his greatness and stated that the Ling thus formed out of Ratnas will be called Ratneshwar.
According to Kashi Khand, Chapter 67, a person who worships Ratneshwar Ling will be blessed with all prosperity and wealth. The benefits accruing by reciting one crore Rudra Jap will be attained by performing pooja (prayers) of Ratneshwar.
Ratneshwar is located at K-53/40, on the road leading to Vridhha Kaleshwar/Mrityunjeshwar. People can travel upto this place by rickshaw and the nearest landmark is Bisheshwarganj/GPO.

https://www.bharattemples.com/rudreshwar-temple-varanasi/,"According to Kashi Khand, Chapter 69, the place where Lord Shiva wore the skin of Gajasur after slaying the latter, was called Rudra Vasam. (Kindly refer to Krithi Vaseshwar).
Once the Lord, in his form as Krithi Vaseshwar, was sitting alongwith Goddess Uma Devi when Nandi offered his prayers and stated that there are 68 places of worship dedicated to Lord Shiva in this holy place.  Various idols/Shiv Lings have been brought from several other places by Nandi and installed in Kashi.
From a place called Rudra Mahalayam, Rudreshwar has appeared in Kashi in form of a Ling. Devotees who worship Rudreshwar are certain to reach Rudra Lok (heaven). A person who performs pooja of Rudreshwar Ling in Kashi is sure to be venerated as Lord Rudra.
In another reference, (Kashi Khand, Chapter 97), Goddess Parvaty wanted to know about the various Shiv Lings and deities at several places in Kashi and Lord Shiva was pleased to narrate about such deities.
Lord Shiva narrates about a pond called as Rudravasam where devotees can find Rudreshwar. A devotee who worships this Lord will derive the benefits which would normally accrue on worshipping one crore Rudra Devas.
Kashi Khand mentions Rudreshwar at two locations one at Rudravasam (in the vicinity of Krithi Vaseshwar) and the other near Tripureshwar (Tripura Bhairavi). While the first Shiv Ling no longer exists, the location below pertains to the second Shiv Ling.
On the day of Chaturdasi (fourteenth Day after Amavasya or Poornima) when Ardra (Tiruvadirai) star conjoins, this period of time is very very auspicious. If a person takes bath in Rudra Kund and performs pooja of Rudreshwar, he will certainly reach Rudra Lok, even if he dies in any place other than Kashi. (Of course, death in Kashi will ensure a place in Heaven, that is implied). While Rudra Kund is not in existence, devotees may take bath in River Ganga.
For ready reference, Chaturdasi Thithi falls twice in a month and Ardra is one of the 27 stars. Devotees have to watch out for this combination in the almanac (Panchang). This combination can occur once in an year. In the year April 2009 to March 2009, devotees saw this combination on 21-07-2009. During the last year (April 2008-March 2009) this combination occurred on 10.01.2009.
Since Kashi Khand has attached so much importance to this combination, it is worth going through the Panchang
Rudreshwar is located at D.5/21, near Tripura Bhairavi (D.5/24). Devotees can approach Tripura Bhairavi Temple by travelling upto Dasaswamedh Vishwanath Gully by rickshaw. After entering the Gully, immediately there is a right turn. Devotees may take that right turn, walk for about 100 yards and ask for Tripura Bhairavi Temple. Just after the temple, there is a left turn and Rudreshwar is located on the first door on the right side, inside a house.
Rudreshwar is a huge Ling and the residents of the House permit devotees to worship this Ling.

Special importance is attached to Ashtami and Chaturdasi days.
According to ancient topography, Kashi used to comprise a very large area and Madhyameshwar (as the name implies) was somewhere in the centre of Kashi Kshetra. Subsequently, for various geographical and political reasons, Kashi area started constricting and presently this temple does not fall in the centre.
This temple gains importance because of its proximity to famous Siddha Peeth (Krithi Vaseshwar temple). According to Kurma Puran a person who takes bath in Mandakini Teerth, performs pooja archana at Madhyameshwar temple and performs Shraaddh Karma for his ancestors, certainly attains Moksha and goes to heaven. Mandakini Teerth finds mention in Ling Puran and it is stated that a person who bathes in this Teerth and performs Tarpan, does a great service to his ancestors.
Madhyameshwar temple is located at K-53/63, Daranagar.  Mandakini Teerth as mentioned in ancient texts is almost fully dried up. There is a Mandakini Pond in Company Bagh garden at Maidagin. Maidagin is a contorted form of Mandakini. It is not known how many people actually take bath in this Kund at present as it has now lost its sanctity. The temple is approachable from a famous locality called Bishweshwarganj, which is a great mandi (market place) and travelling to the temple in cycle rickshaw is convenient.

https://www.bharattemples.com/kukkuteshwar-temple-varanasi/,"Lord Shiva was very upset at being away from Kashi for a long time and he wanted to make King Divodas commit some mistake. Accordingly, he sent sixty four Yoginis to create some disturbance, but they were enthralled by the beauty and serene surroundings of Kashi which appeared to be a part of heaven. They ultimately settled down there.
When the Yoginis failed to return, Lord Shiva sent Lord Surya with instructions to create some disturbance in Kashi so as to defeat King Divodas in his resolve. Lord Surya came to Kashi and disguised himself as an astrologer, a learned scholar, a religious propagator, a businessman, a brahmin etc. But he could not find any fault with any person in Kashi or the governance of King Divodas. Lord Surya was also very much attracted towards Kashi and the beauty of the city. Lord Surya thought, if he went back to Mandarachal without fulfilling the wishes of Lord Shiva, the latter would get angry.
Lord Surya finally decided to stay in Kashi. He said to himself, disobeying the instructions of Lord Shiva is a sin, but by staying in Kashi and undertaking religious activities, such sins will easily get cleansed. Accordingly Surya settled down in Kashi for the time being.
When Lord Surya did not return, Lord Shiva sent Lord Brahma to Kashi with the same mission. Lord Brahma also did not return. Then Lord Shiva sent several of his Shiv Gans to Kashi in batches. These Shiv Gans arrived at Kashi and they also found the place enchanting. They installed several Shiv Lings and started performing pooja of these lings. When the first batch did not return, subsequent batches of Shiv Gans were sent and they also did not return.
In one of the batches one Shiv Gan known as Kukkut arrived at Kashi and being enthralled by the beauty of the divine surroundings, installed a Shiv Ling which was named after him as Kukkuteshwar and started praying to Lord Shiva.Kashi Khand, Chapter 53 states that a person who worships egg shaped Kukkuteshwar will attain all happiness and will not have residence in womb (there will be no rebirth).
Kukkuteshwar is located just outside the door opening to the southern side of Durga Devi Temple at Durga Kund. Durga Kund is a famous landmark and people can travel upto this place by cycle rickshaw/auto or car.

https://www.bharattemples.com/kubereshwar-temple-varanasi/,"According to Kashi Khand, Chapter 13, in Kambilya there was one Dikshit named Yagya Dutt. He was proficient in all Vedas and Shastras and performed all rituals connected thereto.  He had a very handsome son and Yagya Dutt performed the Yagyopavith (Sacred thread ceremony) of his son in due course of time.
However, the boy, named Guna Nidhi, did not perform any rituals a must for a Brahmachari like performing Sandhya Pooja etc. Slowly and steadily he got into  bad company and engaged himself in gambling and other such vices. All these days, Guna Nidhi’s mother like an indulgent parent told lies to her husband Yagya Dutt who was under the impression that the boy was engaged in righteous activities.
Guna Nidhi was continuously losing wealth in gambling and he started selling various household articles to settle his gambling debts.  In the process he sold one diamond ring belonging to his mother.  Once when Yagya Dutt was returning  home, he saw one ruffian wearing this diamond ring.  When confronted, the person divulged the truth to Yagya Dutt that the ring was given by Guna Nidhi in settlement of gambling debts.  Only then Yagya Dutt could realize how he had been cheated all along by his son and his indulgent wife.
Yagya Dutt reached home and at once discarded both his wife and son.  He subsequently married one learned man’s daughter and went to some unknown destination.
Guna Nidhi started wandering about, now realizing that he had wasted his life for nothing. He went from one place to another wondering what to do. His ramblings brought  him to a secluded place, where he saw some devotees of Lord Shiva going towards a temple.  He was very hungry and in the hope of getting some food, he followed them to the temple.  Unknown to him it was Shiv Ratri and the devotees started singing religious songs in the temple and Guna Nidhi kept awake the whole night in the hope of getting some food.
Late night when every devotee went to sleep, Guna Nidhi slowly approached the sanctum sanctorum of the temple hoping to find some prasad (eatables offered to the deity) and as it was dark, he tore a piece of cloth from his dress, rolled it like a small wick and lit it to get some illumination.  With the help of such light he grabbed whatever food he could and started running away.  In this attempt, he stumbled upon the foot of one devotee who started shouting.  One of the devotees stuck Guna Nidhi a severe blow on the head and he died instantly.
Soon the attendants of Yam Raj arrived to take Guna Nidhi to Hell as he had committed all sorts of sin in his life.  However, several Shiv Gans also arrived at the scene and took him with them.  The attendants of Yam Raj read out the sins committed by Guna Nidhi including stealing from Shiva Temple. It is said that taking Shiva Nirmalyam (floral wastes and other prasad etc.) out of the Shiva Temple is the most heinous sin.
However, Shiv Gans clearly stated that whatever sins he might have committed, have been washed away by some good and pious acts unknowingly done by him.  On the night of  Shiv Ratri he was awake, had watched the Shiv Pooja performed by the devotees,  had listened to the Shiv Bhajans and  had lit a lamp near the Shiv Ling thereby removing the darkness.  He will take birth as Raj Kumar of Kalinga Desa.
In his new birth the boy who was named Daman soon became the King of Kalinga and ordered all subjects in his Kingdom to ensure that lamps are lit in the Shiva Temples.He followed this ritual meticulously. Due to his good deeds in his entire life, he became Dig Pal (attendant of Lord) named Kuber.
Kuber with his intuition could realize the evil doings committed by him in one of his earlier births.  He came to Kashi, installed a Shiv Ling made of flowers, lit a lamp and started worshipping Lord Shiva. His intense prayers went for a very long time.  Lord Shiva was very pleased and he appeared in person with Goddess Parvaty.  Kuber was very happy with the immense light and the presence of the Lord.  He started blinking and with the left eye he saw Goddess Parvaty in her beautiful self and wondered about her.  Exactly at that time, his left eye lost the vision.
Lord Shiva immediately realized what had happened. However, he blessed Kuber with all sorts of happiness and assured that he (Lord Shiva) would always be with him. Kuber prostrated before Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvaty.  The Goddess also blessed him stating that those who worshipped the Ling installed by him, which was called Kubereshwar, would attain all sorts of Siddhi and also attain Moksha in their life.
Such devotees will always make good friends and will face no enmity in life.  Kashi Khand in this chapter has described the importance of lighting lamps in the temples of Lord Shiva.  Here it is important to note that not only in temples of Lord Shiva, but in all the temples it is important to light lamps during twilight time and this ritual is followed in almost all temples all over the world.
Kubereshwar is located in the north side of Annapurna Devi at D-9/1, Annapurna Temple premises. If a devotee enters the temple, he has to take a left turn where he will encounter the office of Annadanam (free feeding). Immediately thereafter, to the left is Kubereshwar Ling.

https://www.bharattemples.com/kapardeeshwar-temple-varanasi/,"Kapardeeshwar Ling was installed by Shiv Gana Kapardi near Vimal Kund. According to Kashi Khand, in ancient times one devotee of Kapardeeshwar named Valmiki was residing nearby. One day a hideous and cruel looking Pishach/demon (ghost) appeared and told Valmiki that he (Pishach) was once residing near the banks of the holy river Godavari and had committed many sins. He learnt that a person who lives in Holy places and commits sins, attains Pishach Yoni and his present appearance was due to his past sins. He appealed to Valmiki to help him.
Valmiki was all the while chanting Shiv Sahasranam(thousand praises of Lord Shiva) and advised the Pishach to take bath in Vimal Kund and pray to Lord Kapardeeshwar. The pishach did as he was told and attained Mukti. After that, Valmiki gave him vibhuti (sacred ash) to be smeared on his forehead and the Pishach followed his instructions. The value of smearing vibhuti on the forehead is amply described in Kashi Khand inasmuch as a person who smears vibhuti in his forhead is safe from untimely death and mishappenings.
After the Pishach attained Mukti, the above Vimal kund came to be called as Pishachmochan Kund (Kashi Khand chapter 54). This huge kund is still existing in the present day and fairly well maintained.
It is believed that people who pray to Kapardeeshwar attain absolute control over emotions and Krodh (anger). They are cleansed of all their sins.
Kapardeeshwar temple is located at C-21/40, Pishachmochan, which is a famous locality in Varanasi. This place can be reached by cycle rickshaw or auto-rickshaw from Chetganj or Maldahiya or Faatmaan road (Sigra).

https://www.bharattemples.com/jwara-hareshwar-temple-varanasi/,"On a request by Goddess Parvati, Lord Shiva narrated the various deities/Shiv Lings/Teerths (Sacred Ponds) spread over the expanse of Kashi. (Kashi Khand, Chapter 97).
Towards the east of Gopreksheshwar, devotees can find Jwara Hareshwar Ling (referred to as Vijwarar in Kashi Khand). Devotees who are running high fever get rid of their ailment by worshipping Jwara Hareshwar.
One point needs to be mentioned here. When Kashi Khand was conceived and even after a long time when it was actually written, medical science had not at all made any progress. Any fever was considered to be serious because in those days, people used to follow strict regimen of exercise, diet, fasting etc. Most of the people were healthy and with the human body’s immune system taking care of any external attack, only a few people used to fall sick. If at all they fell sick, it was much beyond mild ailment.
In the present day environs, with medical advancement and diagnostic and pathological facilities available, people may not attach much importance to mild fevers etc.
Jwara Hareshwar is located at J.6/85, Jaitpura, on the way to Skanda Mata temple. Devotees can reach this place by rickshaw via Jaitpura Police station. Skanda Mata temple is quite famous. There is another temple No. Ck.2/4, Patani Tola, where people claim that Jwara Hareshwar is located. However, Pandit Kedarnath Vyas who has done extensive research has given the Jaitpura address for this temple.
The compiler personally enquired at the Jaitpura Jwara Hareshwar temple and was advised that even now devotees who are afflicted with fever etc., (despite consuming medicines) pray to Lord Jwara Hareshwar and get quick relief.
One point needs to be mentioned here. According to the direction mentioned in Kashi Khand, Jwara Hareshwer is located to the east of Gopreksheshwar (Lal Ghat, Machhodari/Gai Ghat). Towards the east will be the area encompassing Prahlad Ghat, Trilochan and River Ganga.
Jwara Hareshwar at Jaitpura falls to the west and the temple of the same name at Patani Tola would fall to the South. One reason for this anomaly could be that on account of invasion and destruction of temples, some Shiv Lings may have been shifted away from their original place, after Kashi Khand was actually written. There have been historic evidences of various temples being destroyed and constructed at other sites.
So, the devotees should get a clear picture and not get confused.

She learnt about the divinity in installing a Shiv Ling in Kashi. Accordingly, she installed a Shiv Ling somewhere towards the east of Visweshwar Ling.
Getting a darshan of Gangeshwar Ling is somewhat difficult. On Dussehara day (Vijay Dasami day), if a person performs pooja of Gangeshwar Ling, his sins accumulated over several years will be washed away. Let alone having darshan of Gangeshwar Ling and benefiting out of it, if a devotee reads or listens about Gangeshwar Ling, he will earn the punya which will accrue to him by bathing in Holy River Ganga.

Lord Shiva was very upset at being away from Kashi for a long time and he wanted to make King Divodas commit some mistake. Accordingly, he sent sixty four Yoginis to create some disturbance, but they were enthralled by the beauty and serene surroundings of Kashi which appeared to be a part of heaven. They ultimately settled down there.
When the Yoginis failed to return, Lord Shiva sent Lord Surya with instructions to create some disturbance in Kashi so as to defeat King Divodas in his resolve. Lord Surya came to Kashi and disguised himself as an astrologer, a learned scholar, a religious propagator, a businessman, a brahmin etc. But he could not find any fault with any person in Kashi or the governance of King Divodas. Lord Surya was also very much attracted towards Kashi and the beauty of the city. Lord Surya thought, if he went back to Mandarachal without fulfilling the wishes of Lord Shiva, the latter would get angry. Lord Surya finally settled in Kashi.
Subsequently, Lord Shiva sent Lord Brahma to Kashi with the same purpose. Lord Brahma, disguised as an old Brahmin, visited King Divodas. He was welcomed with honour by King Divodas, who asked the guest (Lord Brahma) as to what could be done for his comfort. The old Brahmin said he desired to perform Aswa Medha Yagna and requested the King to provide all the materials and make arrangements. Lord Brahma, with the help of King Divodas, performed not just one but ten Aswa Medha Yagnas.
Lord Shiva then sent his Shiv Gans who also were enthralled by the beauty of Kashi and decided to stay there. Installing a Shiv Ling in Kashi is considered very auspicious and the Shiv Gans installed various Lings at several places in Kashi. These Shiv Lings came to be known after their names. (Kashi Khand, Chater 53).
Finally Lord Shiva summoned his son, Lord Ganesha (Vinayak) with the specific mission of creating disturbances in the governance of King Divodas.
Lord Vinayak reached Kashi and assumed the guise of an old astrologer. He made people dream of something and in the morning he met those people and narrated the effects of dreams. He also started interpreting the position of planets in various persons’ horoscopes. By such minatory predictions, he made several people leave Kashi.
In due course, he gained entry into the King’s palace and managed to win the confidence of the ladies thereat. As days went by he also impressed the Queen who told the King about the greatness of the old astrologer and suggested that the King should pay his respects to him. On getting his permission, the Queen sent for the old astrologer.
The King welcomed the astrologer with all humility and the latter blessed the King as per the usual practice. The King asked the astrologer to predict the future. The astrologer after deep thought, told various things about the King and the kingdom. He also stated that starting from that day, on the eighteenth day one Brahmin will come and give him (King) some serious advice which should be followed. After saying this the astrologer left the palace.
In some way or the other Vinayak fulfilled his father’s wishes and settled down in Kashi in various different places in different forms.
Finally Lord Vishnu was sent to Kashi where he approached King Divodas as a Brahmin on the eighteenth day. He was welcomed with all honour by the King and Lord Vishnu in the disguise of a Brahmin preached the King all the good things. The King stated that during his period of governance, the people of Kashi were extremely happy and that there was a sense of religious fervour all around.
King Divodas was advised by the Brahmin to install a Shiv Ling in Kashi, which is considered very auspicious. The Brahmin further advised that after installation of Shiv Ling, on the seventh day, a celestial plane would land from Heaven and take the King to Lord Shiva’s abode. King Divodas was very happy at hearing this. He gave the Kingdom to Rajkumar Samaranjayan, installed a Shiv Ling which came to be known as Divodaseshwer and started praying to Lord Shiva. At the pre-appointed day, the celestial plane landed on the earth, and the King was taken to Lord Shiva’s abode.
Those who worship Divodaseshwar will always be happy, they will be absolved of all their sins and they will be victorious in the battlefield. In the present day parlance, this may be taken as victorious in any competition.

https://www.bharattemples.com/dhruveshwar-temple-varanasi/,"Dhruveshwar Temple, Varanasi
Dhruv’s mother Suniti saw tears in Dhruv’s eyes and soon came to know about the happening in the Darbar. Dhruv wanted to know from his mother, while both Suniti and Suruchi were the wives of the King, why he was being discriminated and ill treated and supposed as inferior to his step brother Uttam.
With utter dismay, Suniti told Dhruv that Suruchi must have performed all benevolent acts in her previous life. All persons ought to do good deeds like philanthropy, display of respect to elders, proper studies, showing respect to guests, worshipping God, listening to and perusal of various Purans, proper behaviour towards friends and persons equal to their parents. Those who undertake such good deeds are blessed in their next birth. The good exalted positions and comforts enjoyed by them in their present life are certainly the result of good deeds performed in the previous birth.
Suniti also told that Suruchi was the principal queen and all the other queens played second fiddle to her. Therefore, she must have priority over other queens in all respects.
Dhruv sought permission from his mother for undertaking penance and intense prayers to the Lord. Though the boy was too young and tender for such ordeal, yet Suniti gave him permission to follow the path of worship. Dhruv left his home and wandered through the forests in search of a suitable and proper place to carry out his prayers and penance.
He was deeply engrossed in thoughts with his eyes closed and when he opened his eyes, he saw seven great Sages passing by. Dhruv immediately prostrated before the great Sages and told them his plight. He expressed his desire to undertake intense penance to the Lord almighty. Dhruv further told that he would like his step brother to be the heir apparent and become the King in due course. Besides, Dhruv had no intention of enjoying something which he had not earned rightfully. He wanted to become an altruist (one who shows unselfish regard for the interest of others) and achieve something in life. He earnestly requested the great Sages to show him the right path.
All the seven Sages were unanimous in their advice. One by one they asked Dhruv to worship Lord Vishnu, in the process describing Lord Vishnu in his various forms. Further, they also advised the mode and manner in which Dhruv should worship Lord Vishnu. They also taught him some Mantras to chant regularly in praise of Lord Vishnu. After giving all good advices to Dhruv, the great Sages departed.
Dhruv reached the banks of Yamuna and started intensely praying Lord Vishnu by chanting the various Mantras as advised by the Sages. His prayers were so intense that many Devas like Lord Indra felt petrified. They tried to disturb Dhruv in his prayers but could not succeed. Kashi Khand, Chapter 20, has described in detail the type of prayers undertaken by Dhruv and various methods of interruptions adopted by the Devas.
The Devas alongwith Lord Indra approached Lord Brahma and narrated the intense penance and austerity undertaken by Dhruv and expressed their fear that their own position was in jeopardy (danger). Lord Brahma assured the Devas and assuaged their apprehension by telling that Dhruv would not do anything detrimental to their interest and advised them not to lose their composure.
However, Lord Vishnu soon realized the sincerity of the penance undertaken by Dhruv and appeared before him. On seeing the Lord in person, Dhruv was overwhelmed with ecstasy and started weeping. He started singing various mantras in praise of Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu was very pleased and he granted that Dhruv’s mother would always remain with him.
Lord Vishnu told that he was on the way to Kashi, the abode of Lord Shiva. Lord Vishnu showered encomiums (high praises) on Kashi Kshetra and Lord Visweshwar who blesses all the denizens of Kashi. Lord Vishnu made Dhruv sit on Garuda and took him to Kashi. The day was Poornima of Kartik month. On the way, Lord Vishnu stated that a person who takes bath in river Ganga on the Shukla Chaturtasi day of Kartik month and worships Visweshwar is blessed with Moksha.
After reaching Kashi, Lord Vishnu advised Dhruv to install a Shiv Ling in Kashi and worship Lord Shiva. According to Lord Vishnu, if a person installs one Shiv Ling in Kashi it is equivalent to installing one million Shiv Lings in other places. Further, if a person constructs or renovates a temple in Kashi, he will get the punya equivalent to giving entire Sumeru Mountain in Daan (offering). After giving all such good advices to Dhruv, Lord Vishnu disappeared.
Very religiously, Dhruv dug a Kund, installed a Shiv Ling, constructed a temple and started praying Lord Shiva. Soon thereafter he left for his home.
According to Kashi Khand, a devotee who worships Dhruveshwar will attain all happiness in life and reach Dhruv Lok (heaven) after death. Further, prosperity will never leave the devotee. Kashi Khand has described the events related to Dhruv in detail in chapters nineteen to twenty one. Kashi Khand also states that those who read and listen to the story of Dhruv will be absolved of all their sins and will reach the abode of Lord Vishnu after death.
Dhruveshwar is located in the premises of Sanatan Dharm College, Nai Sarak, Varanasi. This is a famous locality and devotees can reach this place by rickshaw/auto.

https://www.bharattemples.com/dhanvantareshwar-temple-varanasi/,"Varanasi, also known as Kashi, is a holy city in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, with a rich cultural and religious heritage. One of the most revered temples in Varanasi is the Dhanvantari Temple, dedicated to Lord Dhanvantari, the Hindu god of medicine and healing. This article will provide a comprehensive guide to the Dhanvantari Temple, exploring its history, architecture, and significance.
Dhanvantareshwar Temple, Varanasi Overview
Lord Shiva was relating the various sacred Teerths (Ponds), Koop (Wells), and places of worship in Kashi.  Lord Shiva described such places with blissful joy (Kashi Khand, Chapter 97).In the vicinity of Malteeshwar is the Dhanvantareshwar Ling. By worshipping this Ling, the devotee is cleansed of all sins committed by him and the devotee is cured of his diseases. Kashi Khand mentions one Dhanvantareshwar Koop (Well) where Dhanvantari (celestial physician) had dropped various medicines/drugs like Mrit Sanjivini, the elixir which revives the dead ones. The Koop is presently not visible.  However, in the near vicinity is Kalodak Koop (Well). The water from the well is capable of curing all diseases.   Old-timers believe that Dhanvantareshwar Koop has merged itself with Kalodak Koop. 
The Dhanvantari Temple is a must-visit destination for anyone interested in Hindu mythology and Ayurveda. With its rich history, beautiful architecture, and spiritual significance, the temple offers a unique and enriching experience for visitors. Whether you are seeking the blessings of Lord Dhanvantari or looking to explore the cultural and religious heritage of Varanasi, the Dhanvantari Temple is a destination not to be missed.
The Dhanvantari Temple was built during the reign of the Maratha ruler, Maharaja Ranjit Singh, in the early 19th century. It is located in the Chowk area of Varanasi, near the Dashashwamedh Ghat, one of the most popular ghats in the city.

https://www.bharattemples.com/dasaswamedheshwar-temple-varanasi/,"Lord Shiva sent Lord Brahma to Kashi to create disturbance in the Kingdom to make King Divodas leave the Holy City. (For details kindly refer to Divodaseshwar). Lord Brahma assumed the guise of an old Brahmin and visited King Divodas.  He was welcomed with honour by King Divodas, who asked the guest (Lord Brahma) as to what can be done for his comfort.  The old Brahmin said he desired to perform Aswa Medha Yagna and requested the King to provide all the materials and arrangements.  Lord Brahma, with the help of King Divodas, performed not just one but ten Aswa Medha Yagnas.  The place where he performed these Yagnas is known as Dasaswamedh Teerth (now known as Dasaswamedh Ghat).  Prior to that the place was known as Rudra Sarovar.
Subsequently, Lord Brahma installed a Ling called Dasaswamedheshwar and decided to stay in Kashi.  Lord Brahma could not find any fault with King Divodas and could not think of anything to report to Lord Shiva.
According to Kashi Khand (Chapter 52), a devotee who takes bath at Dasaswamedh Ghat and worships Dasaswamedheshwar, is cleansed of all his sins.  A person who does the above act of worship on the 1st day after Amavasya in the month of Ashad will attain punya of the highest order and all his sins accumulated over two generations will be washed away.
A devotee should take bath from the first day to tenth day after Amavasya every month in Dasaswamedh  Ghat and worship Dasaswamedheshwar and he will always remain happy and there will be no rebirth for him.  More importance is attached to the ten days as above in Jyeshta month (June 22-July 21).
Dasaswamedheshwar Ling is located at Dasaswamedh Ghat inside Shitla Mandir, at D-18/19. Devotees can travel upto this place by rickshaw. Alternatively, they can travel upto Dasaswamedh Ghat by boat and climb the steps.

https://www.bharattemples.com/dandapani-temple-varanasi/,"Long time back, there was a Yaksh named Ratnabhadra who had a son named Poornabhadra. After the death of Ratnabhadra, Poornabhadra started leading a comfortable life, but he had no issue, so he longed for children.
He expressed his desire to his wife, Kanaka Kundala, who in turn, asked him to worship Lord Shiva in Kashi. Poornabhadra did as he was asked by his wife. He worshipped Lord Shiva by means of singing Bhajans and very soon his wife delivered a beautiful boy who was named Harikesh.
In due course, Harikesh became eight years old and developed a religious proclivity (natural inclination or disposition) of mind. He also started worshipping Lord Shiva by making clay Shiv Lings. He used to address his friends by various names of Lord Shiva like Chandrashekhar, Mrityunjay, Trilochan, Neelkant, etc. He used to visit various Shiva Temples without fail.
His father Poornabhadra was a little upset because Harikesh had become religious very early in his life. He asked Harikesh to be involved in household activities but the boy would not listen. Without telling his parents, one fine morning Harikesh left his home and started wandering aimlessly. He remembered an incident sometime back, when a Sage had told his father; if a person does not have any proper destination, Varanasi (Kashi) is the best place for him.
Harikesh soon arrived in Kashi and started worshipping Lord Visweshwar (Shiva). Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvaty were in Anandavan (Kashi) and Lord Shiva was describing the various aspects of Kashi. In the process, he stated that those who live in Kashi will be happy and those who die in Kashi will have no rebirth. They are indeed praiseworthy. (Kashi Khand, Chapter 32 has amply described the beauty of Kashi as narrated by Lord Shiva to Goddess Parvaty).
While all these discussions were going on, Lord Shiva saw Harikesh whose body had gone completely lean. He was emaciated and his body resembled a skeleton. Goddess Parvaty was moved by the boy’s intense worship of Lord Shiva and she asked Lord to bless the boy suitably. Accordingly Lord Shiva approached the boy and gently touched him. The boy was immensely pleased on seeing the Lord shining like one crore Suryas. He started singing praises of Lord Shiva.
Lord Shiva blessed the boy, stating that he will remain in Kashi as a saviour of votaries of Lord Shiva. He will protect the holy place from the evil forces and drive them away by his powers. Lord Shiva also ordained that two of his Shiv Gans named Samparam and Utparam would always be present with the Yaksh (Harikesh). Lord Shiva addressed Harikesh as Yaksh Raj (King of Yaksh) and granted that those who do not worship the latter would not get the benefit of Mukti in Kashi. Harikesh was also given the title of Dandapani (the one with the staff in his hand).
Lord Shiva further stated that devotees who take bath in Gyan Vapi Teerth and after performing rituals for their forefathers, worship Dandapani will become very fortunate and receive his (Lord Shiva’s) blessings. Kashi Khand states that Dandapani will stand or remain towards the south of Lord Visweshwar and will expel all wicked persons and admit only virtuous people for worshipping Lord Shiva in Kashi.
Those who worship Dandapani in Kashi will find that all their obstacles in life are removed and they will be quite happy in life. They are sure to attain Mukti.
Dandapani is located at Ck.36/10, Dhundhiraj Galli, Bazar behind Gyan Vapi. Devotees can travel upto Gyan Vapi (Near Chowk) by rickshaw, take a right turn, climb down the steps and again take a right turn. (If a devotee proceeds diagonally towards left, he will enter the Gyan Vapi area). After walking a few yards, the devotee will come to Markandeyshwar on the right side and immediately thereafter he will find Dandapani. For ready reference, Jalans (textile merchants) have a portion of their shop nearby. One thing is worth mentioning here that this Dandapani should not be confused with another Dandapani temple which is in the proximity of Kaal Bhairav temple.

Chandra also dug one Koop (Well) which is known as Chandra Koop. Chandreshwar Ling is one of the Navgraha Shiv Lings and people who undertake Navagraha Yatras perform pooja of Chandreshwar Ling.
After installing this Ling, Chandra undertook rigorous intense penance (Tapas) to propitiate Lord Shiva. This went on for several years after which Lord Shiva appeared in person and blessed Chandra. Lord Shiva stated that the place where the Ling was installed is a Shakti Peeth (seat of vital energy). A person who performs pooja and archana at Chandreshwar Ling on Poornima days (Full Moon) will attain highest level of prosperity and happiness.
Lord Shiva also attached special importance to Amavasya which falls on Mondays (Somvati Amavasya). Devotees should perform Pooja of Chandreshwar on Triodasi (two days before the Amavasya), observe fast on Chaturdasi (one day before Amavasya). Finally on Somvati Amavasya, the devotees should take bath in Chandra Koop, perform Shraaddh Karma for their forefathers. This will give them ultimate happiness and the blessings of their forefathers.
If for some reason, the rituals for forefathers cannot be performed, devotee should at least touch the water of Chandra Koop. Again, if for some reason, the devotee is not able to touch the water of Chandra Koop, he should at least see it so as to get the benefits prescribed in the above paragraph.
After performing the pooja etc. as mentioned above, devotees should perform Annadan (Offering of food) to Sanyasis (Saints) etc. On poornima days in the month of Chaitra (March – April), if the Star Chitra coincides, they should undertake the above poojas etc. of Chandreshwar. Even if a staunch devotee of Chandreshwar, dies in any place other than Kashi, he is certain to reach heaven. (Kashi Khand, Chapter 14). Worshipping Chandreshwar Ling gives mental peace and clarity in thoughts.

Lord Shiva further stated that he will always be present in Chandeeshwar Ling and those who worship this deity will attain Mukti.  A devotee who comes to Avimukta Kshetra (core area of  Kashi) and worships Chandeeshwar will definitely attain Moksha and there is no doubt about it.

https://www.bharattemples.com/budheshwar-temple-varanasi/," According to Kashi Khand, once Chandra (Moon) got deeply infatuated with Tara, wife of Brihaspati. Despite warnings by Devas, Chandra forcibly took Tara with him. In spite of many requests and pleadings Chandra kept Tara with him for several days and refused to part with her.The matter was referred to Rudra Dev who attacked Chandra with a weapon called Pinak. Chandra also retaliated. However, at the end Tara was separated from Chandra and handed over to Brihaspati.
Soon Brihaspati realised that Tara was pregnant. He asked her to get rid of that to-be born child from her womb. She did so in the garden, but by that time the child was fully developed. The moment the baby touched the ground, the entire assemblage of the Devas came to know about the birth of a child. All of them insisted on knowing from Tara as to who was the father of the child, but Tara kept silent.
In the meantime, the newly born child who was very intelligent (with Buddhi) threatened that he would curse Tara unless she revealed the truth. Finally Tara revealed that Chandra was the father of the child. Considering the high level of intelligence of the child (Buddhi), he came to be called Budha. Budha sought permission from Chandra to go to Kashi and pray to Lord Shiva, to which Chandra agreed.
Budha came to Kashi, installed a Ling and started worshipping Lord Shiva for several years. Finally Lord Shiva appeared before him and blessed him stating that the Ling installed by Budha be known as Budheshwar and those who worship this Ling will attain highest level of intelligence and such level of intelligence will always remain with the devotee despite his age. (Kashi Khand, Chapter fifteen).

According to Kashi Khand, Surya was born to Kashyap and Dakshayani. Surya married Sangya, who was very devoted to her husband, as is expected of dutiful wives.
In due course, two sons and one daughter were born to them. The first one was a boy named Vaivasvathamanu, second again a boy named Yamraj and third was a girl named Yamuna. However, Sangya somehow felt that the heat emanating from Surya was increasingly becoming unbearable.
Sangya created a clone of herself who was named Chhaya (shadow). She was an alter ego (splitting image) of Sangya. Under instructions from Sangya, Chhaya was to perform the role of Sangya, spend her life as wife of Surya, without disclosing the secret to any one. She was also expected to take good care of the above three children. After getting an assurance from Chhaya, Sangya went away to her father’s house.
After some time, Chhaya gave birth to three children of which the second one was Shani. But once her own children were born she started showing lesser and lesser love to the children of Sangya. Surya came to know about this and got extremely angry whereupon, Chhaya divulged the secret. However, considering her innocence, Surya pardoned her.
Surya went in search of Sangya who was undergoing severe and intense penance. Due to poor eating and fasting her body had assumed the shape of a mare and Surya disguised himself as a horse (Ashwa in Sanskrit). In this state, two children were born to them who were twins and came to be known as Aswani Kumars. They are also the divine physicians. Surya later pardoned Sangya also. (Kashi Khand Chapter 17).

Precisely at that time, one snake passed through the muddy area with a dead worm in its mouth. The moment the dead worm came into contact with the muddy area, it revived.
The sage wondered there must be something in that muddy area which he thought must contain Amrita Sanjivini (elixir capable of overcoming death). He started digging the mud and found one small Ling of the shape and size of a goose berry. The sage immediately took the Shiv Ling out of the mud, and after observing all the rituals, installed the Shiv Ling ceremonially. He then started worshipping the Shiv Ling which was named by him as Amriteshwar.
According to Kashi Khand, Chapter 94, devotees who touch Amriteshwar Ling will attain Amritatva (victory over death).  The Shiv Ling has been described to be  so powerful as to make the dead people alive. It is also said that those who pray to Amriteshwar will have no fear of rebirth.
Further, in Kashi Khand, Chapter 73, Lord Shiva tells Goddess Parvaty about fourteen powerful Shiv Lings in Kashi which are capable of giving mukti to devotees.  Amriteshwar is first among the fourteen mentioned by Lord Shiva.
Amriteshwar is located at Ck.33/28, Neel Kant, Baccha Maharaj Ganga Putra House.  From Neelkanteshwar devotees will take a left turn (towards the eastern side) and after walking a few yards, they will come across a Kali Temple.  Amriteshwar is just opposite  the Kali temple. People can travel upto Chowk by rickshaw and walk upto this place. The temple is located close to Adi Chunchanagiri Mahasamsthana Shakha Mutt of Karnataka.
The place of worship also houses Amriteshwari Devi who finds mention in Kashi Khand, Chapter 70.

Once there lived a pious Brahmin called Vishwanar alongwith his wife Suchishmati. After due prayers, they were blessed with a male child. The child was named Grahapati by all elders and eminent personalities.
Vishwanar performed all the sanskars (rituals) connected with child birth and upbringing of a child. Upanayan Sanskar of Grahapati was performed at the age of five and he was given Brahmopadesh. The boy learnt all the vidyas from his Guru/father.
One day Sage Narad visited their house and was overwhelmed by the hospitality extended by Vishwanar and his family. Sage Narad made Grahapati sit on his lap and examined him in detail. Afterwards, Narad told the parents that the child had all the indications of a Raja Yog and all parts of his body, his mannerisms etc. pointed out to that. But at the age of twelve, he will have to face a very serious threat to his life by Lightning (Agni). After saying this, Sage Narad left their place.
On hearing this, both the parents were taken aback. Vishwanar fainted and his wife started weeping bitterly. On seeing their parents’ plight, Grahapati told them that he will go to Kashi and start worshipping Lord Shiva in his form of Mrityunjay. He came to Kashi, took bath in Manikarnika Teerth and worshipped Lord Vishweshwar.
Soon Grahapati installed a Shiv Ling and started performing intensive Tapas to please Lord Shiva. He performed abhishek with 108 pots of Ganges water on this ling and performed various poojas and archana with flowers and other ingredients. He was on fast for several months at a stretch and this went on for two consecutive years till he attained the age of 12. The danger time, prescribed by Sage Narada had approached.
Lord Indra appeared before Grahapati and offered him a divine wish. Grahapati respectfully stated that he was worshipping Lord Shiva and the latter can only grant him any wish or blessing and none else. Lord Indra claimed that he was the only God who could bless him. Grahapati again politely repeated his words, which infuriated Lord Indra to such an extent that he attacked Grahapati with Vajraayud (thunderbolt). Grahapati on account of the above attack, fell down unconscious.
Then Lord Shiva appeared before him and woke him up. Grahapati woke up as if he was awakened from a deep sleep and saw Lord Shiva in person standing before him. Lord Shiva told Grahapati that the latter was put to test. None of the devotees of Lord Shiva need to fear from any one as they are under the protection of the Almighty. He told Grahapati that the latter would have the status of Deva.
The Ling installed by Grahapati will henceforth be known by the name of Agneeshwar Ling. A devotee who worships Agneeshwar Ling will not have any fear from lightning or fire. He will not be faced with Akal Mrityu (untimely death). If a person performs pooja etc. of Agneeshwar in Kashi, he will reach Agni Lok even if he dies elsewhere. After saying all this, Vishweshar disappeared into the Agneeshwar Ling. (Kashi Khand, Chapter 11).
The temple is located at House No. Ck.2/1, Patani Tola, Bhosala Ghat, Varanasi. One can travel upto Chowk by Cycle Rickshaw and walk to this place via Sankata Devi Temple (famous landmark).

Sage Narad came across Vindhya mountains and told the latter that Sumeru Mountain was growing in height and Vindhya mountain would soon be surpassed. Irked by this, Vindhya mountain started growing higher and higher. In the process, he blocked the sunlight to major part of the world. This created chaos. Many of the living beings, plants etc. started to die. Devas and other learned men ran to Lord Brahma and pleaded with him to intervene. Lord Brahma advised them to go to Kashi and take up the matter with Sage Agasthya.
Devas alongwith Brihaspati came to Kashi and straight away went to Sage Agasthya’s Ashram. They saw a serene atmosphere where the Sage was praying to Lord Shiva in the form of a Shiv Ling installed by the former. The Shiv Ling was known as Agasthyeshwar. Sage Agasthya had dug a kund which was later called Agasthya Kund where he used to take bath daily and perform all the pooja and rituals in worship of Lord Shiva. Kashi Khand, Chapter 3 has described in detail the tranquil and divine ambience of the Ashram.
Those devotees who take bath in Agasthya kund and perform the rituals for their forefathers, will derive full benefits of staying in Kashi. (Kashi Khand, Chapter 26).
Devotees should take bath in Agasthya Kund and perform the rituals for their forefathers. They should worship Agasthyeshwar. Such devotees will be absolved of all their sins. All their sufferings will vanish and they will reach heaven after their death. (Kashi Khand, Chapter 61).
Agasthyeshwar Ling is located at D.36/11, August Kund Mohalla. This will come somewhere in the vicinity of Nattu Kottai Chatram. Devotees who approach from Godowlia will come across Susheel Cinema.

https://www.bharattemples.com/atma-veereshwar-temple-varanasi/,"According to Kashi Khand, Chapater 82, Lord Shiva described the power of Veereshwar Ling as under :
Once a kingdom was ruled by a very religious minded ruler named Amitrajit. He was a staunch devotee of Lord Vishnu and he made it a rule that all the citizens of his kingdom also became devotees of Lord Vishnu.  One day Narad Rishi visited his palace and was welcomed with due respect by the King.
As per the direction of Narad Rishi, King Amitrajit saved one beautiful girl called Malayagandini from the clutches of one evil person. The King subsequently married her and they came to Kashi and were immediately happy with the beautiful surroundings.  In due course, Malayagandini was blessed with a handsome male child, who was destined to become 16 years old, immediately after birth.  However, since he was born in an inauspicious planetary combination, the Ministers of the King told the Queen that  she would have to sacrifice the child, otherwise the King would die.
In order to save the King, she sent the child to Vikata Devi.  But no one was inclined to slay the handsome boy who had been 16 years of age by then.  The boy undertook severe penance of Lord Shiva, whereupon Lord Shiva appeared before him in form of a Ling.  This Ling was named by Lord Shiva as Veereshwar Ling.
According to Lord Shiva, a person who performs Pooja, Abhishek and archana of Veereshwar Ling attains all sort of happiness, prosperity and success.
Kashi Khand, Chapter 83, states that a person who performs pooja of Veereshwar gets the benefit of doing pooja of three crore Lingas.
It is considered auspicious to worship this Ling during Chaturdasi nights without going to sleep or bed.  It is also considered auspicious to perform abhishek of this Ling with Panch Amritam (five ingredients namely milk, curd, honey, sugar and clarified butter) (Kashi Khand ibid).
Kashi Khand, Chapter 11, mentions  the importance of pooja/archana of Atma Veereshwar for being blessed with a child. One Sage Vishwanar and his pious wife prayed at various places in Kashi and finally arrived at the Siddha Peeth of Atma Veereshwar.  He performed all rituals and rites at this temple for many months, reciting a prayer called Abhilasha Ashtakam  and one day he saw a boy aged eight years standing near the Ling.  The sage started worshipping the boy with the same fervour as one would worship Lord Shiva with.
The boy was none other than Lord Shiva himself who directed his devotees to recite Abhilasha Ashtakam for one year, as was done by Sage Vishwanar, which will certainly result in progeny for childless couples.  Subsequently, the boy disappeared into the Atma Veereshwar Ling.
Though this Ling is mentioned as Veereshwar in Kashi Khand, presently, this ling is called as Atma Veereshwar or the soul of Veereshwar.
Atma Veereshwar temple is located at Ck-7/158, Scindia Ghat which is a famous locality in Varanasi. This place can be reached by boat through Scindia Ghat.  Alternatively one can travel in cycle rickshaw upto Chowk and walk down the gullies to reach the temple.

https://www.bharattemples.com/kedareshwar-temple-varanasi/,"Kedareshwar is a Shiva temple in Himalayas which is one of the twelve jyotirlingas. According to Kashi Khand, one gentleman performed the upnayanam ceremony of his son named Vashisht at Ujjain. The boy, Vashisht, was very religious and performed all poojas including Linga pooja etc. He used to visit Kedareshwar Temple in Himalayas alongwith his Guru regularly and perform pooja of Lord Kedareshwar.
Once, on the way to Kedareshwar, the Guru died unfortunately and since he had all along done only good deeds, he found a place for himself at Mount Kailas. Vashisht who was 12 at that time, got an enlightenment that those who go for having darshan of Kedareshwar are blessed with all punyas. He then went and settled down at Kashi.
But on all Chaitra Month Poornima days (March 20-April 21), Vashisht (who remained a Brahmachari) used to visit Kedareshwar Ling at Himalayas and this went on for 61 years. But due to old age, he could not move out and he started praying to Lord Shiva at Kashi. Lord Shiva blessed him with a wish and Vashisht requested that Lord Shiva should kindly appear at Kashi itself as Kedareshwar.
Lord Shiva was overwhelmed with the sincerity and devotion of Vashisht and granted accordingly. He appeared as Kedareshwar at Kashi and told Vashisht that performing pooja at Kedareshwar at Kashi will yield seven times greater punya as compared to performing pooja at Kedareshwar at Himalayas (Kashi Khand, Chapter 77).
Gauri Kund, Hans teerth and Manasarovar teerth find mention in Kashi Khand in reference to Kedareshwar but now only Gauri Kund remains. Manasarovar and Hans Teerth have dried up.
People observe vrath (fast) on Chaitra Month (March 20-April 20) Shukla Paksha Chaturdasi and break their fast on Poornima day, the next day, after performing pooja of Kedareshwar. This is as stated in Kashi Khand where Vashisht used to pray Lord Kedareshwar on Chaitra Poornima days (as mentioned in para above).
Kashi is divided into three Khands, Omkar Khand, Vishweshwar Khand and Kedar Khand. It is believed that a person who dies in Kashi attains Mukti. Going a step further, if the person dies in the area governed by Kedar Khand, he obtains immediate mukti while in other two Khands, there are some sort of hardships to be faced.
On all India basis there are twelve Jyotirlings and there are twelve important Shiv Lings in Kashi which represent the aforesaid twelve Jyotirlings. Kedareshwar (Varanasi) is worshipped as Kedareshwar Jyotirling (Uttarakhand).
 
The temple is open for worship 03.00 a.m. to 11.00 p.m. Mangala Aarti is performed at 03.15 a.m., 2nd Aarti at 10.00 a.m.,  3rd Aarti at 05.30 p.m. and Shayan Aarti at 10.30 p.m. Timings may change depending upon the season.
Important days are Ekadasi, Pradosham and Poornima days. Anna Abhishek is performed once in a year.  In this ritual, the Shiv Ling is covered with cooked rice.
Taking bath in Ganges on every Monday and performing pooja/abhishek of Lord Kedareshwar is very auspicious. Much importance to attached to poojas on Mondays during Shravan month (July 23 to August 20) and most importantly on last Monday of that month.  It is believed that performing Shraaddh ceremony on Amavasya which falls on Tuesday at Kedar Ghat is very auspicious.
The poojas at the temple are performed by Kumaraswamy Mutt of Tamil Nadu.  For doing special pooja etc., it is advisable to consult the Poojari before hand.

https://www.bharattemples.com/krithi-vaseshwar-temple-varanasi/," Please put on the speaker attached to your System and click on the mp3 file above)Lord Shiva was describing the fame of Ratneshwar to Goddess Parvaty and precisely at that time Mahishasur’s son Gajasur was aggressively beating up and killing various Shiv Gans (attendants / servitors). Wherever his steps touched the ground there were earthquake like tremors. His gigantic hands uprooted all the trees and his forceful exhalation of breath caused huge tidal waves in the ocean.
Left alone, Gajasur would have created havoc in the world and Lord Shiva did not want any sort of disturbance in the Punya Kshetra : Kashi. When Gajasur approached him in a speed, Lord Shiva pierced him with his Trishul and lifted him high in the sky. Before dying Gajasur told Lord Shiva that he was extremely happy that he faced death at the hands of Lord Shiva and this was indeed a bliss in disguise for him. All living beings have to die one day or the other and he prayed that such kind of death should be a boon to all. He also wished that, after his death, his skin should adorn Lord Shiva for ever and he (Gajasur) would have the satisfaction of being in constant touch of Lord Shiva.
Lord Shiva agreed accordingly. He further stated that Gajasur had attained his death in the Avimukta Kshetra called Kashi and his body will attain the form of a huge Shiv Ling precisely at that place. This Ling will be called Kriti Vaseshwar. Krithi Vaseshwar will be a huge/enormous ling, much bigger than any of the Shiv Lings in Kashi. For the benefit of mankind, Lord Shiva stated that he and his family will always remain in Krithi Vaseshwar Ling.
All sins committed in previous births and present births are washed away by performing various poojas and good/righteous actions. But a mere darshan of Krithi Vaseshwar would cleanse the devotee of all his sins. Whatever benefit is derived by reciting seven crore Rudra Jap, will be attained simply by one Rudra Jap (japam) in front of Krithi Vaseshwar. (Kashi Khand, Chapter sixty eight). Jap or Japam is repeated recitation of a mantra or shloka.
According to Brahma Vaivart Puran, Krithi Vaseshwar makes the life of Kashi Vasis (residents of Kashi who have adopted divine life) fruitful and gives Moksha to devotees who pray at this temple. According to Koormapuran, whether a devotee attains Moksha even after thousand births or not, with blessings of Krithi Vaseshwar, the devotee certainly attains moksha and is liberated.
Elsewhere in Kashi Khand, Goddess Parvaty desired to know about the Lingas which are worshipped in Kashi and which are capable of giving mukti. Lord Shiva told Goddess Parvaty that there are crores of Lingas in Kashi (Kashi Khand, Chapter 73) of which many are Swayambhu Lingas and many have been established by devotees after observing vedic rituals.
Of the above Lings, there are fourteen prominent Lingas and by merely uttering the names of such Lings, the devotee is absolved of all his sins. Fourth among such Lings is Krithi Vaseshwar Ling.
During medieval times, many Mughal rulers destroyed various temples. Of the important temples of Kashi which were destroyed three were prominent, i.e. Vishweshwar Temple, Krithi Vaseshwar Temple and Bindu Madhav Temple (Vishnu). Krithi Vaseshwar temple was situated to the north of Kal Bhairav temple and was destroyed by Aurangzeb. Near the temple was Hans Teerth. People were known to take bath in Hans (Swan) Teerth and pray at Krithi Vaseshwar temple.
After destruction of the temple, the reconstruction was undertaken by Raja Patnimal after a long gap and the present temple was constructed at a place to the South of the ancient temple and worship is being done at this newly constructed temple now.
One important point needs to be mentioned here. Original Krithi Vaseshwar was in a huge temple premises. As mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs, a mosque was constructed after destruction of the temple and there was a fountain, precisely at the place where Krithi Vaseshwar Ling existed once. Till about 3 years back, devotees used to pray at the fountain on Shiv Ratri days, at the spot where the Ling stood once. A few years back, one huge Ling had been installed again on that spot. It is learnt that the devotees are offering simple prayers at the above spot also.
Special importance is on all Chaturdasi days after Poornima (one day before Amavasya). A person undergoing Vratham on the above day and doing pooja at Krithi Vaseshwar temple attains highest level of happiness. Kashi Khand lays special importance for pooja/archana during Magha month (Jan. 21 – Feb. 20), Chaturdasi day after Amavasya (fourteenth day) and Chaitra month (March – April) Poornima days. Performing pooja on such days will be highly beneficial for the devotees.
Krithi Vaseshwar temple is located at K-46/23, West of Har Tirath Pond, in Mrityunay Mahadev Road. Hans Teerth as mentioned in ancient texts is now known as Har Tirath and many buildings have now come up where once the pond existed. The temple is approachable from a famous locality called Bishweshwarganj, which is a great mandi (market place) and travelling to the temple in cycle rickshaw is convenient.

https://www.bharattemples.com/omkareshwar-temple-varanasi/,"According to Kashi Khand, Chapter 73, Goddess Parvati wanted to know about Omkareshwar Ling and Lord Shiva narrated as under :
Once Lord Brahma underwent severe penance for several long years and a mighty or very strong force erupted from beneath, piercing the ground, radiating divine light all over. This assumed the form of a divine Ling and Lord Brahma beheld a divine energy which was representative of all the Vedas (Rig, Yajur and Sam Veda), the energy which represented Akaar, Ukaar and Makaar. Lord Brahma saw in that divine light, the energy of OM which governs the entire universe.
Lord Brahma visualized a creature with four horns, seven hands, two heads. The Lord also saw a divine energy encompassing all the Vedas, Puranas, five Brahms (Akaar, Ukaar, Makaar, Naad and Bindu). Lord Brahma was so enchanted with the Panchakshara Ling (Panch+Akshar means five letters mentioned within the coasts above) that he started singing praises of Lord Shiva whom he could visualize in person, standing in front.
Kashi Khand has described in detail the praises and eulogy which were expressed by Lord Brahma in veneration of Lord Shiva. Very pleased with the prayers of Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva granted a divine boon to the former. Lord Brahma desired that Lord Shiva should always be present in the Shiv Ling which had appeared as a Divine energy and the name of the Ling should be Omkareshwar. Lord Shiva granted accordingly and stated that the Shiv Ling was to be called Shiva Panchayatan, symbolic of Akaar, Ukaar, Makaar, Naad and Bindu.
A devotee who takes a holy dip in Matsyodari Teerth and worships Omkareshwar will not have the fear of rebirth. A person who worships Omkareshwar will derive the benefits accruing out of performing Ashwa Medha Yagna. Worshipping Omkareshwar is equivalent to reciting one lakh Rudra Japam and is also equivalent to worshipping all the Shiv Lings in the world.
A person who is a devotee of Omkareshwar will attain Mukti even if he dies at any place other than Kashi. Lord Shiva told Lord Brahma that with the radiating energy of Omkareshwar, Lord Brahma will be successful in his job of creating human beings. After granting all the boons to Lord Brahma, Lord Shiva disappeared inside the Ling.
Earlier there were five Shiv Lings representing Shiva Panchayatan viz. Akaareshwar, Omkareshwar, Makaareshwar, Naadeshwar and Bindu Ling.  Now there are only three Lings, Akaareshwar, Omkareshwar and Makaareshwar.
Omkareshwar Ling is also known as Kapileshwar and Nadeshwar. Omkareshwar ling was stated to be on the banks of Matsyodari Teerth where, during rainy season, the rising river Ganges also  used to join.
According to Kashi Khand (Chapter 73), on Ashtami and Chaturdasi days, having a bath in Matsyodari Teerth and praying to Lord Omkareshwar, will cleanse the devotee of all sins.  A person praying at Lord  Omkareshwar temple is really lucky and will find place in heaven. His ancestors plunge into ecstasy on seeing their descendent praying at the above temple.
Omkareshwar temple is located at A-33/23, Pathani Tola, North of Machhodari. Matsyodari Teerth as mentioned in Kashi Khand has dried up now and the locality is known as Macchodari. The temple is approachable from a famous locality called Machhodari and if a devotee travels through the left of Machhodari, he will come across Trilochan Police Chowki after which he will take a left turn to reach Omkareshwar.

When Lord Shiva was narrating the greatness, he was accompanied by Lord Indra on one side and seven great rishis were surrounding him. (Kashi Khand, Chapter 99, para 5).” Even today, seven poojaries (believed to be the descendents of the great seven rishis) perform a daily pooja at Vishwanatha Temple at around 7-7.30 p.m., known as Sapta Rishi Pooja/Aarti. As on date devotees can see video clippings  of this Aarti at www.shrikashivishwanath.org. However, devotees who visit Kashi must make it a point to participate in this Holy ritual and it is certain that they will like the Aarti to their utmost satisfaction.
There are various types of Poojas and rituals prescribed in ancient texts like Kashi Khand, Padma Puran, Linga Puran etc. but considering the present environs it may not be possible for any person to follow the steps mentioned in the above texts.  It is believed that taking a dip in the Holy Ganges at Manikarnika Ghat and having darshan at Vishwanath Temple will cleanse all sins of a person.
The greatness of Visweshwar (Vishwanath) has been described amply in Kashi Khand in several places in several chapters and if an attempt is made to reproduce the same here, it may consume much space.  However, it is sufficient to say that Vishwanath temple is highly revered and worshipped by several devotees not only from all over India but all over the world.
Every year on the day after Deepavali Amavasya, 56 Bhog Annakoot Shringar is done at Vishwanath Temple and this attracts devotees from all over the world.  It is believed that having darshan of this beholding sight will prevent shortage of food at our house.
Statue of Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar. Oldest Kashi Vishwanath Temple was built in 100 BCE by Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar  which was destroyed by Muslim rulers in 1193 first time. And Last time by Aurngazeb in 1669.
The temple complex consists of a series of smaller shrines, located in a small lane called the Vishwanatha Galli, near the river. The linga of the main deity at the shrine is 60 cm tall and 90 cm in circumference housed in a silver altar. The main temple is quadrangle and is surrounded by shrines of other gods. There are small temples for Kaalbhairav, Dhandapani, Avimukteshwara, Vishnu, Vinayaka, Sanishwara, Virupaksha and Virupaksh Gauri in the complex. There is a small well in the temple called the Jnana Vapi also spelled as Gyaan vapi (the wisdom well). The Jnana Vapi well sites to the north of the main temple and it is believed that the Jyotirlinga was hidden in the well to protect it at the time of invasion. It is said that the main priest of the temple jumped in the well with the Shiv Ling in order to protect the Jyotirlinga from invaders.
According to the structure of the temple, there is a Sabha Griha or Congregation Hall leading to the inner Garbha Griha or Sanctum Sanctorum. The venerable Jyotirlinga is a dark brown colored stone which is enshrined in the Sanctum, placed on a silver platform. Structure of the Mandir is composed of three parts. The first compromises a spire on the Mandir of Lord Vishwanath or Mahadeva. The second is gold dome and the third is the gold spire atop Lord Vishwanath carrying a flag and a trident.
The Kashi Vishwanath temple receives around 3,000 visitors every day. On certain occasions the numbers reach 1,000,000 and more. Noteworthy about the temple is 15.5 metre high gold spire and gold dome. There are three domes each made up of pure gold.
As per Shiva Purana, once Brahma (the Hindu God of creation) and Vishnu (the Hindu God of Harmony) had an argument in terms of supremacy of creation.To test them, Shiva pierced the three worlds as a huge endless pillar of light, the jyotirlinga. Vishnu and Brahma split their ways to downwards and upwards respectively to find the end of the light in either directions. Brahma lied that he found out the end, while Vishnu conceded his defeat. Shiva appeared as a second pillar of light and cursed Brahma that he would have no place in ceremonies while Vishnu would be worshiped till the end of eternity. The jyotirlinga is the supreme partless reality, out of which Shiva partly appears. The jyothirlinga shrines, thus are places where Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light. There are 64 forms of Shiva, not to be confused with Jyotirlingas. Each of the twelve jyothirlinga sites take the name of the presiding deity – each considered different manifestation of Shiva.At all these sites, the primary image is lingam representing the beginningless and endless Stambha pillar, symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva
The twelve jyothirlinga are Somnath in Gujarat, Mallikarjuna at Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh, Mahakaleswar at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, Omkareshwar in Madhya Pradesh, Kedarnath in Himalayas, Bhimashankar in Maharashtra, Viswanath at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Triambakeshwar in Maharashtra, Vaidyanath Jyotirlinga, Deogarh in Deoghar, Jharkhand, Nageswar at Dwarka in Gujarat, Rameshwar at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Grishneshwar at Aurangabad in Maharashtra.
The Manikarnika Ghat on the banks of Ganges near to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple is considered as a Shakti Peetha, a revered place of worship for the Shaktism sect. The Daksha Yaga, a Shaivite literature is considered as an important literature which is the story about the origin of Shakti Peethas
The temple is located at Ck-35/19, Chowk, Varanasi. The narrow lane or Gully approaching the temple is known as Vishwanath Gully.  There are three approach lanes one via Dashashwamedh Road, 2nd via Bansphatak and third via Gyanvapi.   It is difficult to prescribe the convenient entry point because due to heavy police patrolling, entry points keep changing. During peak rush days like Mondays and other important festivals, the police may regulate the pilgrims through Gyanvapi and the exit point may be through Bansphatak etc.  Since the temple is located in deep Gully, it is advisable to visit the temple alongwith  a local person or Guide.
The temple is open almost 24 hours with slight gap of about 1-2 hours. The day begins with Mangla Arti at around 2.30 a.m. to 4.00 A.M. Bhog is at 11.30 to 12.30 noon. Sapta Rishi Pooja is carried out at around 7 to 7.30 p.m. daily followed by Shringar at 9.00 p.m. and Shayan pooja at 11.00 p.m. The timings may vary slightly depending on the seasons (summer/winter).
Special poojas are performed daily at various timings by Nattu Kottai Nagaratthar Chatram (of Tamil Nadu) based in Varanasi. For South Indians visiting Kashi, it is advisable to stay for at least two days in Nattu Kottai Chattram and participate in the poojas undertaken by them.

https://www.bharattemples.com/trilochaneshwar-temple-varanasi/,"Trilochan Ling finds mention in Kashi Khand as Trivishtabh Ling.  In the south of Trilochan, three holy rivers Yamuna, Saraswati and Narmada joined together once. It is believed that these three rivers themselves performed abhishek of Trilochan Ling (Kashi Khand, Chapter 75).
While Omkareshwar Ling attained prime importance among all Lings in Kashi, the importance of darshan of Trilochan Ling is given more prominence.  Trilochan is a Swayambhu Ling and  it is stated in Kashi Khand that the Ling came to the earth from seven Patal Lokas, piercing each and every layer.
Let alone having darshan, even uttering the word of Trilochan by mouth will cleanse the devotee of his sins.  A person knowingly or unknowingly committing sins in any place, finds mukti in Kashi and a person committing a similar sin in Kashi finds mukti by eulogizing (praising) Trilochan Ling. (Kashi Khand, ibid).
The three rivers mentioned above join together in a Teerth called Pilpila Teerth.  It is believed that taking a bath in Pilpila Teerth and having darshan of Trilochan is considered very auspicious.
Performing pooja/archana of Trilochan on all Ashtami and Chaturdashi days are auspicious.  In Vaishaka Month (April 20-May 20) Shukla Paksha Tritheeya (third day after Amavasya), also known as Akshay Tritheeya is a very very auspicious day and people who observe vrath (fast) on that day and perform Shraadh Karma (rituals towards their forefathers) attain high level of enlightenment and obtain blessings of their ancestors and Gods.
If all the Shiv Lings in the world are visualised as a human being (personified), Trilochan Ling is the Eye of the Personified structure.  Local pundits believe that Trilochan Ling is the third eye of Vishweshwar Ling.
In Kashi Khand, besides Pilpila Teerth, there is mention of Padodak Koop (well). This Koop is still existing in the temple premises.  Pilpila Teerth is existing in the form of Pilpila Koop very near to Trilochan temple. While the Padodak well has been kept covered, there is a pump attached to the well, with the help of which water is drawn
Trilochaneshwar Temple is located at A-2/80, Trilochan Ghat. The temple is approachable from Birla Hospital after Machhodari upto which place, devotees can travel by Auto or Cycle Rickshaw. Alternatively, they can have a boat ride upto Trilochan Ghat and climb the steps. This temple also houses Varanasi Devi which finds mention in Kashi Khand, Chapter 33.

So she is called Maha Gauri (Gauri means fair complexioned/white). She always grants wishes to her devotees without fail. Devotees get all round prosperity and they do not have to face any sort of grief or sorrow.

Brahmacharini Devi’s form is brilliant and very magnificent. She has a bead garland in her right hand and a Kamandalu (water pot) in her left hand.
In her previous birth she was born as the daughter of Himalaya. At that time, she was encouraged by Sage Narad’s advice and she underwent a rigorous penance for several thousand years to be blessed with Lord Shiva as her husband. Due to this rigorous penance, she was called Tapascharini. All the Devas and Sages described her penance as extra ordinary and began to praise her. In the end, Lord Brahma was also impressed and addressed her saying that nobody had done such a rigorous penance and it has been admired by everybody everywhere. Lord Brahma further stated that Tapascharini will get Lord Shiva as her husband.
This second form of Maa Durga grants her devotees unlimited wishes.

By saying that the devotee’s name will not figure in the books of  Chitra Gupta, it means that all the sins of the devotee, committed knowingly or unknowingly will be cleansed away.
As per Puranic belief, the third power of Maa Durga is Chitra Ghanta  who is worshipped on the third day of Navratri.  She has a crescent shaped bell on her forehead and so she is called Chandra Ghanta.

Devi sent her emissary, Kalratri, alongwith a few other ladies to warn Durgasur. Kalratri reached Durgasur’s abode and passed on the message. She further asked him to refrain from tormenting religious people, return the land etc. grabbed by him and go elsewhere, otherwise Goddess Devi would certainly slay him. With utter arrogance Durgasur asked his warriors to capture Kalratri and imprison her.
When the warriors approached her, Kalratri exhaled with a roar which produced jets of fire balls and thousands of the warriors were killed. This further infuriated Durgasur, who ordered more warriors to chase her. Kalratri immediately flew through the sky, reached Goddess’s abode near Vindhyachal mountains and reported the entire happenings to Goddess.
Soon Durgasur arrived at the place where Goddess was stationed and a fierce war ensued. In the process, Devi released all her Shaktis which took form of various female warriors (with extreme powers).
The battle has been described in detail in Kashi Khand. Here we may suffice it to say that Goddess, with her extreme powers, killed Durgasur and all his deputies. There was extreme joy in the entire world and peace and happiness returned.
All devas and other learned people praised Goddess by reciting Vajra Panchakam. Goddess was pleased and assumed the name of Durga Devi (on account of slaying Durgasur). Goddess Durga told the people that devotees should recite Vajra Panchakam which will help them in overcoming any sort of obstacles.

https://www.bharattemples.com/kamakhya-devi-kamakshi-temple-varanasi/,"Lord Shiva was in Mandarachal and Kashi was ruled by a very pious and religious King named Divodas. In his Kingdom every one was very happy and there was all round prosperity. He had reached an understanding with Lord Brahma that as long as he was ruling, Devas and other celestial beings should stay away from Kashi and should not create any disturbance in Kashi. (Kashi Khand, Chapter 45).
Lord Brahma more or less agreed to it but on one condition that King Divodas should prove to be an excellent administrator and all people living in Kashi and visiting Kashi should be treated well in their religious pursuits. The King agreed and accordingly gave excellent governance.
Lord Shiva was very upset at being away from Kashi for a long time and he wanted to make King Divodas commit some mistake. Accordingly, he sent sixty four Yoginis to create some disturbance, but they were enthralled by the beauty and serene surroundings of Kashi which appeared to be a part of heaven. They ultimately settled down in Kashi and established themselves at various places all round the Kshetra. KAMAKHYA DEVI (KAMAKSHI DEVI) was one of them
All the places where these Yoginis stationed themselves are regarded as Shakti Peeth. A person praying at these places will get divine energy. The devotees will be blessed with mental peace, victory in competitions and debates and will attain all round success.

https://www.bharattemples.com/katyayani-temple-varanasi/,"This ancient temple, located in the heart of Varanasi, is dedicated to the goddess Katyayani, one of the forms of the powerful Hindu goddess Durga. The temple is famous for its unique architecture, intricate carvings, and vibrant festivals that attract devotees from all over the world.
According to Kashi Khand, Chapter 82, Once a kingdom was ruled by a very religious-minded ruler named Amitrajit. He was a staunch devotee of Lord Vishnu and he made it a rule that all the citizens of his kingdom also become devotees of Lord Vishnu.  One day Narad Rishi visited his palace and was welcomed with due respect by the King.
As per the direction of Narad Rishi, King Amitrajit saved one beautiful girl called Malayagandini from the clutches of one evil person. The King subsequently married her and they came to Kashi and were immediately happy with the beautiful surroundings.  In due course, Malayagandini was blessed with a handsome male child, who was destined to become 16 years old, immediately after birth.  However, since he was born in an inauspicious planetary combination, the Ministers of the King told the Queen that she had to sacrifice the child, otherwise the King would die.
In order to save the King, she sent the child to Vikata Devi in Pancha Mudra Maha Peeth.  Vikata Devi summoned various Yoginis and asked them to take the boy to Matrika Devis with whose permission, the child should be spared.  Accordingly, the Yoginis took the boy to Matrika Devis, who after observing the divinity in the boy, ordered the Yoginis to take the boy back to Pancha Mudra Peet.
The boy was brought back to the Pancha Mudra peeth by the Yoginis where he started praying.   In nutshell, the boy had undertaken a short trip to heaven and returned.
Vikata Devi is known and worshipped as Katyayini Devi. Maa Durga’s 6th form is Katyayini. She got this name on account of the following story. When Demon Mahishasur’s cruelty became unbearable on earth, Lords Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva gave a part of their energies and created a Devi to kill Mahishasur. Sage Katyayan was the first person to perform her puja and so she is called Katyayini.
Maa Katyayini grants wishes to her devotees without fail. To acquire Krishna as their husband, the Gopis of Braj had performed her puja on the banks of  Kalindi Yamuna. She is regarded as the supreme saviour Goddess in Braj (Mathura-Vrindavan).
Her form is supposed to be very simple and divine. Her colour is golden and radiant. She has four hands. Her upper right hand has the posture assuring safety or protection and lower right hand grants wishes. She has a sword in her upper left hand and a lotus flower in lower left hand. Her vehicle is lion.
Katyayini Devi blesses her devotees who are freed from any sort of disease, sorrow, fear and suffering. They radiate supernatural energy.
The Katyayani Temple has a rich and ancient history that dates back to the Vedic period. According to Hindu mythology, the temple was built by Sage Katyayana, who was a great devotee of the goddess Durga. The sage prayed to the goddess for many years to bless him with a daughter, and the goddess Katyayani was born to him. In gratitude, he built this temple to honor the goddess.
Over the centuries, the temple has undergone several renovations and additions by different rulers and devotees. The current temple structure is believed to have been built during the 18th century by the queen of the Nagpur kingdom, Rani Bhavani.
The Katyayani Temple is an important destination for Hindu pilgrims and spiritual seekers who seek blessings from the goddess Katyayani. The goddess is believed to be the epitome of courage, strength, and wisdom, and worshipped for her power to overcome obstacles and bring success and prosperity. The temple is especially famous for its Navratri festival, a nine-day celebration of the goddess’s victory over the demon Mahishasura. During this festival, the temple is decorated with lights, flowers, and colors, and devotees perform special rituals and prayers to honor the goddess.
Apart from its religious significance, the Katyayani Temple is also a fine example of ancient Indian architecture and art. The temple is built in the North Indian style of architecture, with a pyramidal roof, intricate carvings, and beautiful paintings that depict scenes from Hindu mythology. The main deity of the temple, the goddess Katyayani, is depicted as a fierce warrior goddess with four arms, riding a lion, and holding weapons like a sword, a trident, and a lotus.
The temple’s architecture is a marvel of ancient Indian craftsmanship and artistry. The temple is built in the traditional North Indian style, with a pyramidal roof, multiple levels, and intricate carvings and paintings that depict scenes from Hindu mythology. The temple’s main entrance is a stunning gateway that is adorned with beautiful sculptures and carvings of gods and goddesses.
The Katyayani Temple is a vibrant and active place that offers a range of activities and events for visitors. Apart from regular worship and prayers, the temple hosts a range of cultural and spiritual events throughout the year, including festivals, music concerts, and religious discourses. The temple also has a special prayer room for couples who seek blessings for a happy and fruitful married life.
The Katyayani Temple is steeped in legends and local stories that add to its mystique and charm. One of the most popular legends associated with the temple is that of the demon Mahishasura, who was defeated by the goddess Katyayani. According to the legend, Mahishasura was a powerful demon who had received a boon from the god Brahma that made him invincible against all male gods. With his newfound power, Mahishasura began to wreak havoc on earth, destroying villages and terrorizing people.
The gods realized that they could not defeat Mahishasura on their own, and so they approached the goddess Durga for help. The goddess agreed to help them and took the form of Katyayani, the daughter of Sage Katyayana. She rode into battle on a lion, wielding powerful weapons, and after a fierce battle, she defeated Mahishasura and restored peace to the earth.
Another popular local story associated with the temple is that of a Brahmin who was blessed by the goddess Katyayani. The Brahmin was a poor man who was struggling to make ends meet. He prayed to the goddess Katyayani for help, and one day, the goddess appeared to him in a dream and told him to go to the temple and worship her. The Brahmin followed the goddess’s instructions and was blessed with wealth and prosperity, which he used to help the poor and needy.
These stories and legends add to the allure and appeal of the Katyayani Temple and continue to inspire and captivate visitors from all over the world.

According to the scholar Jones, the Shakti Pithas were originally part of cult worship by the tribals as local deities, which over the centuries were syncretised to Shakthi Peethas under the influence of the Brahmins, and have now a permanent influence on the psyche of the people. In the syncretism of various religious beliefs in the country, as many as 108 goddesses were assimilated in the Shakti Pitha list.
Annapurna, the goddess of food and form of Shiva’s consort Parvati, is given the epithet Vishalakshi, the “wide-eyed”. Her most famous temple stands at Varanasi, where patron goddess she is considered. The Skanda Purana narrates the tale of the sage Vyasa cursing Varanasi, as no one in the city offered him food. Finally, Vishalakshi appears in the form of a housewife and grants food to Vyasa. This role of Vishalakshi is similar to that of Annapurna, who offers food to her husband Shiva, whose hunger can be satiated by her food. Shiva gratified by Annapurna’s food, establishes Varanasi and appoints her as its presiding goddess. The goddess Vishalakshi of the Varanasi temple may have been identified with Annapurna in early times, however over time became a distinct goddess, resulting in the goddess temples.
Vishalakshi, the “wide-eyed” goddess is often associated two other goddesses: Kamakshi, the “love-eyed” goddess of Kanchipuram and Minakshi, the “fish-eyed” of Madurai, prominently because of their similar names. Together the three are regarded the most important Goddess temples by South Indians. While Vishalakshi dwells in North India, the other goddess temples are in Tamil Nadu, South India. South Indians venerated Vishalakshi for ages and have strong ties with the temple. South Indian Tamil people also helped renovate the temple in 1971.
Devotees can find Vishalakshi temple at D.3/85, Mir Ghat. They can travel upto Dasaswamedh Vishwanath Gulli or Bansphatak Vishwanath Gulli by rickshaw and walk on foot to this place. Devotees generally combine prayers at this temple alongwith darshan of Visweshwar / Annapurna temple.

Long time back several great Sages sitting atop Sumeru Mountain desired to know from Lord Brahma as to who was indestructible and supreme. Lord Brahma proclaimed himself to be that superior person. On hearing this, Yagyeshwar (symbolic of Narayan) reprimanded Lord Brahma for his hasty and audacious utterances.
Both of them asked the same question to the four Vedas. Rig Veda replied that the omnipotent deity who controls all living beings, named Rudra is supreme. Yajur Veda replied that He, whom we worship through various Yagnas (Yagam) and other such rigorous rituals, is none other than Shiva, who is supreme. Sam Veda stated that the respected figure who is worshipped by various Yogis and that Person who controls the entire world is none other than Triambakam. Finally, Atharva Veda said, all human beings can see the Lord through Bhakti Marg and such a deity who can remove all the worries of human beings is indeed Shankar. In a nut shell, all the four Vedas proclaimed that Lord Shiva is the ultimate being.
Both Lord Brahma and Yagya Narayan started laughing in disbelief. Shortly Lord Shiva appeared as a powerful divine light in their midst. Lord Brahma stared at that Being furiously with his fifth head. Lord Shiva immediately created one living being and stated that he (the new being) will be King of Kaal and will be known as Kaal Bhairav. (Here Kaal is denoted to mean the final time viz. death). Lord Shiva further stated Kaal Bhairav will always be in Kashi, removing all sins of the devotees and therefore, he will be known as Paap Bhakshak.
Meanwhile, Lord Brahma’s fifth head was still burning with fury and Kaal Bhairav plucked that head (just as we pluck flowers from the garden). Immediately all the people present there started singing praises of Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva directed Bhairav to go around various places but Brahma Hatya Dosh (affliction on account of hurting a Brahmin) will always follow him. Lord Shiva created a dangerous and fierce looking female figure, named Brahma Hatya and asked her to follow Kaal Bhairav wherever he went.
Kaal Bhairav, with Brahma’s head in his hand, started going around various places in the world, took bath in various Teerths, worshipped various Lords, nevertheless saw that Brahma Hatya was following him all along. He could not get rid of that affliction.
Finally, Kaal Bhairav reached the Moksha Puri, Kashi. The moment Kaal Bhairav entered Kashi, Brahma Hatya started shouting, screaming and finally disappeared into the netherworld. The head of Brahma, (Kapal) fell at a place which was called Kapal Mochan and there was a Teerth which was later called Kapal Mochan Teerth. Then onwards Kaal Bhairav stationed himself permanently in Kashi, giving shelter to all his devotees. Those living in or visiting Kashi, must worship Kaal Bhairav and he grants protection to all his devotees.
Ashtami day (eighth day after Poornima) in the month of Margashirsha is an important day for worshipping Kaal Bhairav. Besides, Sundays, Tuesdays, Ashtami and Chaturdasi days are very important for worshipping Kaal Bhairav. A person who circumabulates Lord Kaal Bhairav eight times will be absolved of all the sins committed by him. A devotee who worships Kaal Bhairav for six months will attain all types of Siddhi. (Kashi Khand, Chapter 31).
Old timers in Kashi believe whenever residents of Kashi leave the city for short journeys, they worship Kaal Bhairav (taking his permission) and on return back to Kashi, they again worship Kaal Bhairav.
 
Kaal Bhairav is located at K-32/22, Bhaironath. People can approach this place by rickshaw either through Bisheshwarganj cross roads or through Golghar (Maidagin). This is a very famous temple and devotees will be guided by the local residents.

After a long time, Lord Surya appeared before him and told the old man that he (Lord Surya) was pleased and the old man may seek any divine boon.
The old man said “for performing Tap (Tapas – rigorous ascetic practices), a devotee needs sufficient strength. There is nothing in this world as good as Tapas which gives prosperity, enlightenment and all joys.  However, one needs to be young and virile enough for carrying out Tapas.” Accordingly, the old man requested Lord Surya that he should be made young.

The girl dutifully performed the rites of her parents and she started praying to Lord Surya in his form of Uttarark Aditya. She underwent severe penance for a considerably long time and observed that a white goat used to come daily and constantly stare at her. The goat used to take bath in the Kund in the morning, wait for the whole day and in the evening, it used to eat dry grass, drink water from the Uttarark Kund and go back. This went on for several years.
One day Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvaty were travelling above and they saw this girl (who had gone lean), praying before Uttarark Aditya. Both Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvaty were deeply moved by the prayers of Sulakshana and Lord Shiva offered the girl a divine wish.
Sulakshana thought for a moment and saw the Goat standing nearby. She requested Lord Shiva to grant a boon to the Goat instead of herself. Goddess Parvaty was moved by the philanthropy exhibited by Sulakshana and ordained that Sulakshana will always be with Goddess Parvaty as a companion. The goat will take rebirth as daughter of Kashi Raja in consideration of its devotion to Uttarark Kund.
According to Kashi Khand, Goddess Parvaty stated that the Kund will be remembered for the sincerity of the Goat (because the Goat was regularly taking bath in the Kund even during severe winter months) and that all devotees should take bath in the above Kund in Paushya Month (December-January) on Sundays and pray to Uttarark Aditya. By performing the above ritual, they will be divinely blessed. The Kund was named Barkari Kund (reference : Sankshipta Skanda Puran, Gita Press, Page No. 831).

Soon Narad left the palace and Lord Krishna started keeping a close watch on Saamba but nothing untoward was observed in Saamba’s behaviour. However, the surveillance went on for quite some time.
After some days, Narad again visited Dwarka Puri and precisely at that time, Lord Krishna was in his personal chambers alongwith various ladies.  Narad called Saamba, who was loitering outside, and told him to inform Lord Krishna about his arrival. Saamba hesitated for a while. It was a double whammy for him.  On the one hand, if he barges in and disturbs Lord Krishna, the latter may get angry.  On the other hand, if he disobeys Narad, he may get angry because on the earlier occasion he had not respected Narad.
With a dilemma, he went inside Lord Krishna’s private quarters, not knowing that Narad was following him.  Both of them disturbed Lord Krishna who was in a compromising position.  Lord Krishna suddenly got up very embarrassed.  All the girls surrounding him were also equally embarrassed. Saamba silently left the place.
Narad gave a wrong interpretation of the events to Lord Krishna stating that the ladies who were with Lord Krishna were indeed seduced by the appearance of Saamba. Lord Krishna got infuriated and cursed Saamba that he will be inflicted with Leprosy.  However, Saamba pleaded innocence and Lord Krishna was very much moved.  He told Saamba that to get rid of this curse, he should go to Kashi and pray to Lord Surya.
Accordingly, Saamba came to Kashi, dug a Kund which was called Saamba Kund and undertook rigorous penance and pooja of Lord Surya.  In due course, he was cured of this dreaded disease.  Lord Aditya who is present at this place came to be called Saamba Aditya.
According to Kashi Khand Chapter 48, a person who takes bath in Saamba Kund religiously on Sundays at sunrise and prays to Saamba Aditya will get cured of any incurable disease, any married lady performing such prayers will always remain Sumangali (Suhagin-lady whose husband is alive) and childless couple will be blessed with child.

Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvaty came to know about this and they appeared in person in front of Lord Surya. Lord Shiva gently touched Lord Surya, whereupon the latter’s extreme heat slowly subsided and he became more or less cool. Lord Surya opened his eyes and started singing praises of Goddess Parvaty and Lord Shiva whereupon both of them became extremely happy. They granted several divine wishes to Lord Surya.
Lord Shiva told Lord Surya that when the latter was performing pooja of the former, only the sunrays were visible and the body of Lord Surya was not visible. Accordingly, Lord Surya will be called Mayukh Aditya. Mayukh means effulgence. Lord Shiva also stated that a devotee who worships Mayukh Aditya on Sundays will never fall ill. (Kashi Khand, Chapter 49).
 
Mayukh Aditya is located at No. K-24/34, Mangala Gauri Temple, Panchganga Ghat.

Alternatively, they can take a boat ride upto Balaji Ghat/Panchganga Ghat and walk up the stairs.
The idol of Mayukh Aditya always remains moist and cool. If we physically remove the moisture and make it dry, the idol will again become moist. The reason for this is Lord Shiva touched Lord Surya to reduce his intense heat (as mentioned above). Old timers in and around the temple believe that the hidden river Dhootpapa is flowing beneath the surface, causing this moistness.
The temple also houses Gabhastheeshwar, Mangala Gauri and Mangal Vinayak. In the close vicinity are temples of Brahmacharini and Brahmeshwar.

https://www.bharattemples.com/khakholkh-aditya-temple-varanasi/,"Sage Kashyap had many wives of which two were Kadru and Vinata. Kadru gave birth to children who were snakes and Vinata who was a huge bird gave birth to Garuda.
Both the sisters were playful. While Kadru was cunning, Vinata was very innocent. Once Kadru, with an ulterior motive in her mind, asked Vinata to play a guess game and the sister who loses in the game will become slave to the winner. Vinata agreed. The guess game was “what is the colour of the Uchchaisrva, one of the horses which draws Lord Surya’s Chariot”. It was well known that the colour was white and Vinata told accordingly.
But Kadru had other game plan in her mind. Upon her insistence, her children (snakes) twined themselves round the tail of the horse Uchchaisrva and started spewing venom. The colour of the horse became grayish black. Vinata lost the game and was enslaved to Kadru and her snake sons. She was very much ill treated and her son, Garuda was deeply pained at her woeful plight.
He appealed to the sons of Kadru to release his mother. They agreed to do so on one condition that he should bring them Amrit (nectar). Garuda knew this was an arduous task because Nectar was closely guarded by the Devas. However, as a dutiful son, he left for Dev Lok to accomplish the mission impossible. In the process, he had to fight with Lord Vishnu. Lord Vishnu was deeply touched by the respect which Garuda had for his mother as well as his filial obligations and told Garuda that henceforth he (Garuda) would be Lord Vishnu’s vehicle.
As regards Amrit, Lord Vishnu let Garuda take it to the snake children as ransom for release of his mother but cautioned that under no circumstances the snakes were to drink it. Garuda took the amrit and gave it to the snake children. His mother was freed by the snakes as per the agreement. Before they could consume the amrit, Garuda told them that the amrit was the purest elixir and a person who wants to consume it should get himself purified first by having a holy bath. Accordingly, the snakes placed the vessel containing the amrit on a mat made of dry grass and left for performing ablutions. In their absence, Lord Vishnu took the vessel and vanished because it did not belong to the snakes rightfully.
When the snakes returned they were anguished to see the vessel missing and with a view to getting at least a drop of amrit, they started licking the mat. The dry grass was very sharp and it slit their tongues. To this day, snakes are born with a forked tongue because they tried to consume something which they had not rightfully earned. Even now, elders advise people to take or consume only such things which have been rightfully earned.
Later, Vinata told her son Garuda that she must have committed some sin which made her a slave. She desired to go to Kashi for atonement of her sins. Garuda took her to Kashi where Garuda installed a Shiv Ling and started praying ardently. Vinata started worshipping Lord Surya in his form as Khakholkh Aditya. Lord Shiva appeared in person and blessed Garuda stating that the latter would be known by everyone in the world as the vehicle/ride (vahana) of Lord Vishnu.
Lord Surya also appeared in person before Vinata and blessed her, whereupon Vinata was absolved of all her sins. According to Kashi Khand, Chapter 50, Khakholkh Aditya finds mention in the proximity of Pilpila Teerth.

Once Lord Surya was travelling in the sky and from a distance he could see Adi Keshav (Lord Vishnu) worshipping a Shiv Ling. Being very curious, Lord Surya came down to the earth and after Adi Keshav finished the prayers, put forward a question to the latter.
Lord Surya asked when the entire world regards Lord Vishnu as Antaratma, the latter should be worshipped. Lord Surya was surprised why Lord Vishnu was worshipping Lord Shiva. To quell his anxiety, Lord Vishnu replied that in Kashi Kshetra Lord Shiva is the supreme Lord and he should be worshipped by every one.
Lord Vishnu extensively described the importance of Linga Pooja in Kashi inasmuch as a devotee who performs abhishek of a Shiv Ling and consumes the water as prasad, gets the punya of taking bath in all religious Teerths (Sacred Ponds). Lord Vishnu advised Lord Surya also to worship Lord Shiva in Ling form in Kashi.  (Kashi Khand, Chapter 51).
Lord Surya piously regarded Adi Keshav as his Guru for giving this sacred knowledge and Lord Surya came to be called as Keshava Aditya at that place.

However, she should be the last one to eat. (Even now old timers say that Guests should be fed first and household ladies should be the last to eat).

Lord Skanda was describing the predicament of Vinata whereby she had become slave once upon a time. Sage Agasthya wanted to know what made her become a slave, even though she was very pious in her daily activities.
Lord Skanda described thus: Sage Kashyap had many wives of which two were Kadru and Vinata. While Kadru gave birth to hundred snakes, Vinata gave birth to three children, Owl, Garuda and Arun. Initially when Owl was born, he became the King of all birds, but due to his incompetency, the birds chose to disregard him. Therefore, to this day the birds do not have a king of their own.
While Owl was her first offspring, the other two were still in the egg. Vinata wished her remaining eggs to hatch but to her utter dismay, the eggs did not hatch. She could not bear the agony of her first child being ridiculed. So, in her impetuousness to beget the baby, she decided to break open one of the eggs prematurely, hoping to get a son. As soon as she broke open the egg, she saw a child within, fully developed from thigh upwards, but the lower portion representing the legs was still under making.
Thus, the premature new born child who was referred to as Arun (Dawn) in Kashi Khand, Chapter 51, was very furious at his mother’s impatience which resulted in his deformity. Arun cursed his mother that she would become a slave to the children of Kadru. Vinata pleaded innocence whereupon Arun took pity on her. He told her not to be impatient with the third egg. The child born out of this egg, will get her out of the slavery.
Having said so, Arun in due course of time wanted to rid himself of the deformity. He came to Kashi and started penitently praying to Lord Surya, who became happy with Arun. He appeared in person and blessed Arun stating that the latter will always be with him (Lord Surya) as his charioteer. Lord Surya said a person who worships me in the form of Arun Aditya will not know what is sadness and poverty will always remain at a distance.
According to Kashi Khand, a person who worships Arun Aditya will never fall ill and there will be no obstacles in the devotee’s smooth life. The devotee will not know what is misery.

The present temple built by Raja of Aundh (Satara, Maharashtra) in 19th Century. Large number of devotees visit this temple.
During the Karthika Month, Vaikuntha Chaturdashi is also one among the prominent festivals which marks the event of Lord Vishnu donating Kashi to Lord Shiva. In celebrations, Lord Vishnu offers Bael leaves to Lord Vishwanath and Lord Vishwanath offers tulasi leaves to Lord Bindu Madhav.
As per directions of Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu travelled from Mandarachal to Kashi with a divine mission of making King Divodas leave Kashi (Kindly read Divodaseshwar)
After having accomplished his mission, Lord Vishnu was enjoying the serene beauty of Kashi, Pancha Nada Teerth, Padodak Teerth and other places.  At Pancha Nada Teerth, he came across one extremely lean looking Sage who was undergoing Tapas.
Lord Vishnu in his divine form approached the Sage whose name was Agni Bindu and stood in front of him.  The Sage, on seeing the Lord in person, was ecstatic and he prostrated before the Lord.  The Sage then started singing praises of the Lord.
The Sage addressed the Lord by various names like Mukunda, Madusudan, Madhav, Narayan, Rama Bhadran, Chatur Bhuj, Janardhan etc.  The Sage also mentioned that those who worship Lord Vishnu with Tulsi leaves or garland made of Tulsi Leaves will get lots of blessings.
After having sung all praises about Lord Vishnu, Agni Bindu Rishi stood silently with folded hands. Lord Vishnu asked the Sage to seek any divine boon. The Sage, in reply, sought only one thing: that Lord Vishnu should always be available in the vicinity of Pancha Nada Teerth.
Lord Vishnu granted accordingly. He further stated that Kashi is a Punya Kshetra and devotees can achieve several kinds of Siddhi by staying in Kashi. Lord Vishnu further told that he would stay in Kashi as long as Kashi is present and there will be no destruction of Kashi, as this holy city is situated atop the Trishul (Trident) of Lord Shiva. Therefore, even Maha Pralay (great deluge) cannot destroy the city.
Agni Bindu Rishi was extremely happy at this and sought one more divine boon from Lord Vishnu. He desired that Lord Vishnu should always be available in the vicinity of Pancha Nada Teerth in the name of the Sage. Further, a devotee who takes bath in Pancha Nada Teerth and even if he dies elsewhere, he should attain Moksha. The Sage also sought that a devotee who bathes in Pacha Nada Teerth and worships Lord Vishnu should be blessed with wealth and prosperity.
Lord Vishnu agreed to the request of the Sage. He stated that henceforth he (Lord) will be known as Bindu Madhav in Pancha Nada Teerth. By his presence, the Teerth will be extremely Sacred and devotees who bathe in this Teerth and honour learned persons, will be blessed with wealth and prosperity.
The Teerth, which is capable of cleansing all Sins, will be called as Bindu Teerth. A person may have committed various sins, knowingly or unknowingly. But if, during the Kartik Month, he religiously bathes in Pancha Nada Teerth and worships Bindu Madhav, he will attain Mukti.
Kashi Khand, Chapter 60 has given in detail the importance of Kartik Month in respect to Pancha Nada Teerth. Lord Visweshwar himself regularly takes bath in this Teerth during Kartik Month.
Lord Vishnu further stated that he (Lord) was called as Aadi Madhav in Sat Yug, he should be worshipped as Ananda Madhav in Tretha Yug, he would present himself in Dwapar Yug as Shree Madhav. In Kali Yug the Lord should be known by the name of Bindu Madhav.

https://www.bharattemples.com/yogdhyan-badri-temple-chamoli/,"The Yogdhyan Badri Temple is as old as the temple of Badrinath. Pandukeshwar is 24 kms from Joshimath, it has the Yogdhyan Badri temple one of the panch badri . The image here, in a meditative posture, is worshiped as at Badrinath.
According to the myth, the Pandavas made over Hastinapur to Raja Parikshit and retired here. Also, king Pandu, the father of Pandavas had spent his last days doing penance here before his Nirvana, and hence the name. Some famous copper plates carrying old inscriptions, providing valuable information on the history of the temple and early Katyuri Rajas have been found here. The surrounding region is Panchal Desh better known as UttarKhand. Surya Kund, which is on the top of the Milam glacier, is a hot water spring. Here Kunti is said to have given birth to Karna, fathered by Surya. Pandu married Kunti at Pandukeshwar near Sri Badrinath.
Yogabadrī temple, Pandukeshwar
The Yogabadrī temple is so different from the Gaṇeśa shrine and all other monuments in the Central Himalayas
The Yogabadrī temple is so different from the Gaṇeśa shrine and all other monuments in the Central Himalayas that it baffled Kanti Prasad Nautiyal, the sole scholar to write about it. He wrote that it was “either influenced by the Buddhist stupa type because of the proximity of the place to the Tibetan region or it may have been just a reproduction of the Pala temple.” Close examination of the Yogabadrī temple’s structural components, however, shows its affiliation with temples in southern India, suggesting that it is a Drāviḍa alpa vimāna.
The foundational moldings of Yogabadrī’s square-plan vimāna appear in the following sequence: minor projecting molding (kṣudropāna)  lotus-formed molding (padmopāna), recessed band (antarita), tri-faced torus molding (tripaṭakumuda), recessed molding (golapāda) with block-projections (galas) and with crocodilian creatures (makaras) only at the corners, upper-fillet molding (ūrdhvakampa), minor molding (upāna), and oversailing fillet (mahāvājan). In contemporaneous Drāviḍa alpa vimānas in Tamil Nadu, this sequence constitutes the molded base (adhisthāna), and it invariably is set beneath the garbhagṛha’s floor level. Furthermore, in Tamil Nadu, a water chute (praṇāla) typically cuts through the mahāvājan or equivalent crowning course. The Yogabadrī temple’s floor level, however, is sited in the middle of this set of molding courses, a feature externally indicated by the water chute that cuts through the tripaṭakumuda.
A wall frieze punctuated by rather plain pilasters rises above the temple’s foundational mahāvājana course. The uppermost portion of the wall frieze features a row of galas, which are sheltered by a heavy kapoṭa decorated with gavākṣas (dormer-window motifs) with trefoil finials. Sculptures of sejant lions are set on the four corners of the plank molding (pratis). Calling to mind a sculptural typology and an architectural convention first seen at the seashore temple at Mamallapuram, they symbolically protect the temple, weigh down a course carved with a diamond-and-pearl pattern, and safeguard the vulnerable junctures of walls. 
A rectangular, enclosed front hall (guḍhamaṇḍapa) fronts the vimāna. It shows the same base molding courses as the vimāna, but its wall frieze is plainer. Beaten copper sheets clad an older roof composed of sloping stone slabs. A short flight of stairs contained by a banister—reminiscent of the curvaceous balustrades of so many Drāviḍa temples in Tamil Nadu—leads devotees toward an unornamented portal. Stepping through this portal, one enters a dark hall, with a door at its far end leading into the garbhagṛha. A cluster of hitherto unpublished metal images of Viṣṇu and his celestial retainers are enshrined in this exalted space (fig. 18). The largest of these images, a golden sculpture depicting Viṣṇu seated in a cross-legged meditative posture (padmasana), appears to date from the time of the temple’s construction in the ninth or tenth century.
(Details taken from here)
Legends believe King Pandu was living with his wives Kunti and Madri in the Pandukeshwar after giving his throne to his elder brother Dhritrashtra. One day Pandu went on hunting in the jungle and unintentionally killed a sage making love in deer form. While the sage was dying cursed Pandu that to be unable to make love with anyone and if he does so, he will die instantly.
To get cleanse of the sin of killing of sages, Pandu installed the bronze image of Vishnu in the Yogadhyan Badri shrine and mediated. Meanwhile, Kunti and Madri gave birth to Pandavas through yogadhyan. Once in a while Pandu got attracted to Madri who was taking bath in the Alaknanda river. Soon Pandu died due to the curse of the sage.
During the 12 years of exile, Pandavas visit Pandukeshwar and perform the funeral of their father Pandu. Here, Arjun also meditated during the exile period and get a blessing from Indra. Pandavas also built a Lord Vasudev temple having idols of Lord Vishnu, Goddess Laxmi, and Madri.

https://www.bharattemples.com/yamunotri-uttarkashi-uttarakhand/,"Yamunotri, Uttarkashi, Uttarakhand
Yamunotri is the source of the Yamuna River and the seat of the Goddess Yamuna in Hinduism. It is situated at an altitude of 3,293 metres (10,804 ft) in the Garhwal Himalayas and located approximately 30 kilometers (19 mi) North of Uttarkashi, the headquarters of the Uttarkashi district in the Garhwal Division of Uttarakhand, India. It is one of the four sites in India’s Chhota Char Dham pilgrimage. The sacred shrine of Yamunotri, source of the river Yamuna, is the westernmost shrine in the Garhwal Himalayas, perched atop a flank of Bandar Poonch Parvat. The chief attraction at Yamunotri is the temple devoted to the Goddess Yamuna and the holy thermal springs at Janki Chatti (7 km. Away).
The actual source, a frozen lake of ice and glacier (Champasar Glacier) located on the Kalind Mountain at a height of 4,421 m above sea level, about 1 km further up, is not frequented generally as it is not accessible; hence the shrine has been located on the foot of the hill. The approach is extremely difficult and pilgrims therefore offer puja at the temple itself.
The temple of Yamuna, on the left bank of the Yamuna, was constructed by Maharaja Pratap Shah of Tehri Garhwal. The deity is made of black marble. The Yamuna, like the Ganges, has been elevated to the status of a divine mother for the Hindus and has been held responsible for nurturing and developing the Indian civilization.
Close to the temple are hot water springs gushing out from the mountain cavities. Surya Kund is the most important kund. Near the Surya Kund there is a shila called Divya Shila, which is worshipped before puja is offered to the deity. Devotees prepare rice and potatoes, tied in muslin cloth, to offer at the shrine by dipping them in these hot water springs. Rice so cooked is taken back home as prasadam. The pujaris of Yamunotri come from the village of Kharsali near Janki Chatti. They are the administrators of the sacred place and perform religious rites. They are well-versed in the Shastras.
Yamunotri Temple is situated in the western region of Garhwal Himalayas at an altitude of 3,235 metres (10,614 ft) near the river source.The original temple was built by Maharani Guleria of Jaipur in the 19th century. The current temple is of recent origin as earlier constructions have been destroyed by weather and the elements. There seems to be a confusion as to who built the temple of Yamunotri. However, according to sources, the temple was originally constructed by Maharaja Pratap Shah of Tehri Garhwal.
According to the ancient legend, sage Asit Muni had his hermitage here. All his life, he bathed daily both in the Ganges and the Yamuna. Unable to go to Gangotri during his old age, a stream of the Ganges appeared opposite Yamunotri for him.
The temple and the place opens every year on the auspicious day of the Akshaya Tritya, which generally falls during the last week of April, or the first week of May. The temple always closes on the sacred day of Diwali in mid-October – first week of November, with a brief ceremony. The temple staff return to their villages and for the rest of the time the valley is gripped in no-man silence and covered with a white sheet of snow. With the melting of the snow next summer, the temple re-opens.
Sangya is the birthplace of the Yamuna in the Champasar Glacier (4,421 m) just below the Banderpoonch Mountain. The mountain adjacent to the river source is dedicated to her father, and is called Kalind Parvat, (Kalind being another name for the sun deity – Surya). Yamuna is known for her frivolousness, a trait that she developed because, according to a common story, Yamuna’s mother could never make eye contact with her dazzling husband.

Surkanda Devi is a Hindu temple situated close to the small resort hamlet of Dhanaulti in the village Uniyal gaon of Tehri District. It is at an altitude of about 3,030 metres, or 9976 ft lies close to nearby hill stations of Dhanaulti (8 km) and Chamba (22 km)walking distance of approx 3 km from Kaddukhal, the place where vehicles are parked.
It is surrounded by dense forests and affords a scenic view of the surrounding region including the Himalayas to the north, and certain cities to the south (e.g., Dehradun, Rishikesh) The Ganga Dusshera festival is celebrated every year between May and June and attracts a lot of people. This is a temple which is situated among the trees of rounslii. It is covered with fog most of the time of the year.
One of the most persistent mythologies concerning the origin of worship at the site is associated with the legend of Sati, who was the wife of the ascetic god Shiva and daughter of the Puranic god-king Daksha. Daksha was unhappy with his daughter’s choice of husband, and when he performed a grand Vedic sacrifice for all the deities, he did not invite Shiva or Sati. In a rage, Sati threw herself onto the fire, knowing that this would make the sacrifice impure. Because she was the all-powerful mother goddess, Sati left her body in that moment to be reborn as the goddess Parvati. Meanwhile, Shiva was stricken with grief and rage at the loss of his wife. He put Sati’s body over his shoulder and began his tandava (dance of cosmic destruction) throughout the heavens, and vowed not to stop until the body was completely rotted away. The other Gods, afraid of their annihilation, implored Vishnu to pacify Shiva. Thus, wherever Shiva wandered while dancing, Vishnu followed. He sent his discus Sudarshana to destroy the corpse of Sati. Pieces of her body fell until Shiva was left without a body to carry. Seeing this, Shiva sat down to do Mahatapasya (great penance). Despite the similarity in name, scholars do not generally believe that this legend gave rise to the practice of sati, or widow burning. According to various myths and traditions, there are 51 pieces of Sati’s body scattered across the Indian subcontinent. These places are called shakti peethas and are dedicated to various powerful goddesses. When Shiva was passing over this place on his way back to Kailashcarrying Sati’s body, her head fell at the spot where the modern temple of Surkhanda Devi stands and due to which the temple’s got its name as sirkhanda which in the passage of time is now called surkanda.

https://www.bharattemples.com/triyuginarayan-temple-rudraprayag-uttarakhand/,"Triyuginarayan Temple, Rudraprayag, Uttarakhand
Triyuginarayan Temple is a Hindu temple located in the Triyuginarayan village in Rudraprayag district, Uttarakhand. The ancient temple is dedicated to god Vishnu. Its fame is credited to the legend of god Shiva’s marriage to goddess Parvati witnessed by Vishnu at this venue and is thus a popular pilgrimage centre.A special feature of this temple is a perpetual fire, that burns in front of the temple. The flame is believed to burn from the times of the divine marriage.Thus, the temple is also known as Akhand Dhuni temple.
The Triyuginarayan temple resembles the temple of Kedarnath in architectural style and hence attracts a lot of devotees. The present shrine is also called as Akhand Dhuni temple. It is believed to have been built by Adi Shankaracharya. Adi Shankaracharya is credited with building many temples in the Uttarakhand region. The shrine houses a silver, 2 foot image of god Vishnu (Narayana), accompanied with consort – goddess of wealth Lakshmi and the goddess of music and learning – Saraswati
In front of the temple, the havana-kund with the eternal flame – the witness of the wedding of Shiva and Parvati – is situated. Devotees add samidha (sacrificial offerings of wood) to the flame and collect the ashes as blessings. A stone called the Brahma Shila – in front of temple – is regarded as the exact spot of the divine marriage.. A water stream called Saraswati Ganga originates in the courtyard of the temple. It fills all the holy ponds in the vicinity.The ponds of Rudra Kund, Vishnu Kund, Brahma Kund and Saraswati Kund are holy spots situated near the temple.Rudra Kund is for bathing, Vishnu for cleansing, Brahma for sipping and Saraswati for offering libations.
According to Hindu mythology, goddess Parvati was daughter of Himavat or Himavan – the personification of the Himalayas. She was the rebirth of Sati, the first wife of Shiva – who sacrificed her life when her father insulted Shiva. Parvati initially tried to allure Shiva by her beauty, but fails. Finally, she won Shiva by practising rigorous penance at Gauri Kund, which is 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) away from Triyuginarayan. Pilgrims visiting Triyuginaryan temple also visit the Gauri Kund temple, dedicated to Parvati, which is the base camp for trek to Kedarnath Temple.Mythology states that Shiva proposed to Parvati at Guptakashi, before they got married in the small Triyuginarayan village at the confluence of Mandakini and Sone-Ganga rivers.
Triyuginarayan is believed to be the capital of Himavat. It was the venue of the celestial marriage of Shiva and Parvati, during the Satya Yuga, witnessed in the presence of the holy fire that still burns eternally in front of the temple in a Havana-kund or Agni-kund, a four-cornered fireplace on the ground. Vishnu formalized the wedding and acted as Parvati’s brother in the ceremonies, while the creator-god Brahma acted as the priest of the wedding, that was witnessed by all the sages of the times. The exact location of the wedding is marked by a stone called Brahma Shila, in front of the temple.The greatness of this place is also recorded in a sthala-purana (a scripture specific to a pilgrimage centre). According to the scripture, pilgrims who visit this temple consider the ashes from the burning fire as holy and carry it with them.It is also believed that ashes from this fire are supposed to promote conjugal bliss.
Before the marriage ceremony, the gods are believed to have taken bath in four kunds or small ponds namely, Rudra-kund, Vishnu-kund and Brahma-kund. The inflow into the three kunds is from the Saraswati-kund, which – according to legend – originated from Vishnu’s navel. Hence, the water of these kunds is considered to cure infertility. The ashes from Havana-kund are supposed to promote conjugal bliss

https://www.bharattemples.com/madhyamaheshwar-garhwal-uttarakhand/,"Madhyamaheshwar, Garhwal, Uttarakhand
Madhyamaheshwar  or Madmaheshwar is a Hindu temple dedicated to god Shiva, located in the Mansoona village of Garhwal Himalayas in Uttarakhand, India. Situated at an elevation of 3,497 m (11,473.1 ft), it is the fourth temple to be visited in the Panch Kedar pilgrimage circuit, comprising five Shiva temples in the Garhwal region. The other temples in the circuit include: Kedarnath, Tungnath and Rudranath to be visited before Madmaheshwar and Kalpeshwar to be visited after Madmaheshwar. The middle (madhya) or belly part or navel (nabhi) of the bull, considered a divine form of Shiva, is worshipped at this temple, believed to be built by the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata.
The temple in the north Indian style of architecture, is situated in a lush meadow, just below a high ridge. The older, so-called ‘Vriddh-Madmaheshwar’, temple is a tiny blackened shrine on the ridge, which looks straight up at the commanding Chaukhamba peaks. In the current temple, a navel-shaped Shiva-lingam, made of black stone, is enshrined in the sanctum.[1] There are two other smaller shrines, one for Shiva’s consort Parvati and the other dedicated to the Ardhanarishwara, a half-Shiva half-Parvati image. Bhima, the second Pandava brother is believed to have built this temple and worshipped Shiva here. To the right of the main temple there is a small temple where the image of Saraswati, the Hindu goddess of learning, made of marble is installed in the sanctum.
In Mansuna village, it is a popular Lord Shiva’s temple in the Garhwal region of the state Uttarakhand. This popular Hindu temple in Uttarakhand is a prominent part of ‘Panch Kedar’ pilgrimage circuit, on which it comes on the fourth. Comfortably seated at a high elevation of 3497 m, the Madhyamaheshwar Temple is said to be built by the heroes of the epic Mahabharata, Pandavas.
Since this Shiva temple is located at a countryside property bent towards the conservation of nature in order to give you the most surreal picturesque, its trail takes you on a short bumpy ride of escapades and adventure for that indelible holiday experience. In order to reach Madhyamaheshwar, one has to undergo a 21 km long moderate trek. The base point of this Panch Kedar Yatra is Uniyana. Moreover, the temple complex is considered as one of the busiest spots of Lord Shiva’s devotees. Though the structure of the temple is not gigantic, yet it is enough to disseminate an eccentric feeling amongst those who gather there. Tiny puddles which embrace the surrounding of the temple impute the calmness and sacredness to a great extent and making it one of the best places to visit in Uttarakhand for peace and spiritualism.
The legend of Madhyamaheswar is an integral part of the legend of Panch Kedar, which is a captivating narration of the efforts of Pandavas to atone for the sins of their fratricide (gotra- hatya) act of killing their cousins, the Kauravas, and Brāhmanahatya (killing of Brahmins – the priest class), during the epic Mahabharata war. On advice from sages and their trusted benefactor god Krishna they sought Lord Shiva to pardon them and bless them to attain salvation. Since Shiva was annoyed with them for their conduct during the Kurukshetra war, he tried to avoid them by assuming the animal form of a bull or Nandi and left for the Himalayan Garhwal region. But the determined Pandavas, after sighting Shiva in the form of the bull grazing in the hills of Guptakashi, tried to forcibly hold the bull by its tail and hind legs. But the bull disappeared into the ground to reappear later in his original self of Lord Shiva at five places; in the form of a hump at Kedarnath, in the shape of bahu (arms) at Tungnath, with his face at Rudranath, his nabhi (navel) and stomach at Madhyamaheswar and his hair (locks) called jata at Kalpeshwar. Pandavas, pleased with the revelation of Lord Shiva at five places in different forms, built temples at these five places, worshipped him and attained salvation with blessings of Shiva.
Madhyamaheshwar Temple is located on a foothill, and thus, reaching there could have been a difficult task to achieve. But, the state transportation along the airway and Indian railway makes it a simple one.
If you prefer airway as your prime mean of transport then for the information, the nearest airport is Jolly Grant Airport in Dehradun which is around 196 km away from the Ukhimath. Ukhimath is the base point of Madhyamaheshwar Trek.
Whereas, the closest railhead is in Haridwar which is around 210 km from the Ukhimath. To reach Ukhimath from the railway station, you can either board a taxi or can also opt to travel in state buses.
For those want to cover their journey by road, visiting Uttarakhand is also pretty-much easy from other cities or towns through the vast network of roads and national highways. For the people travelling from other northern states or cities like Punjab, Delhi, Chandigarh, and Himachal Pradesh, NH7 and Nh334 will leads you to your destination.
Route: Haridwar – Rishikesh – Devprayag – Srinagar Garhwal- Rudraprayag – Ukhimath – Mansoona – Ransi – Gondhar – Madhyamaheshwar
Moreover, if you’re visiting the temple from the Kumaon division of Uttarakhand like Nainital, Almora, or Champawat then in that case, drive through NH109 to reach Madhyamaheshwar.
Route: Nainital – Kausani – Karnprayag – Rudraprayag – Ukhimath – Mansoona – Ransi – Gondhar – Madhyamaheshwar
Once you reach Ukhimath, you’ll have to undergo a 21 km long Panch Kedar trek which starts from Uniyana and cuts through Ransi Village (3 km) to Gaundhar (6 km) to Bantoli (1 km) and further to Khatara to Nanu and finally takes you to your pilgrimage destination in Uttarakhand – Madhyamaheshwar.

https://www.bharattemples.com/kedarnath-temple-rudraprayag-uttarakhand/,"Kedarnath Temple, Rudraprayag, Uttarakhand
Kēdārnāth Mandir (Kedarnath Temple) is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is on the Garhwal Himalayan range near the Mandakini river in Kedarnath, Uttarakhand in India. Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open only between the end of April (Akshaya Tritriya) to November (Kartik Purnima – the autumn full moon). During the winters, the vigrahas (deities) from Kedarnath temple are brought to Ukhimath and worshipped there for six months. Lord Shiva is worshipped as Kedarnath, the ‘Lord of Kedar Khand’, the historical name of the region.
The temple is not directly accessible by road and has to be reached by a 18 kilometres (11 mi) uphill trek from Gaurikund. Pony and manchan service is available to reach the structure. According to Hindu legends, the temple was initially built by Pandavas, and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest Hindu shrines of Shiva . It is one of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams, expounded in Tevaram. Pandavas were supposed to have pleased Shiva by doing penance in Kedarnath . The temple is one of the four major sites in India’s Chota Char Dham pilgrimage of Northern Himalayas. This temple is the highest among the 12 Jyotirlingas.Kedarnath was the worst affected area during the 2013 flash floods in North India. The temple complex, surrounding areas and Kedarnath town suffered extensive damage, but the temple structure did not suffer any “major” damage, apart from a few cracks on one side of the four walls which was caused by the flowing debris from the higher mountains. A large rock among the debris acted as a barrier, protecting the temple from the flood. The surrounding premises and other buildings in market area were heavily damaged.
The temple, at a height of 3,583 m (11,755 ft), 223 km from Rishikesh, on the shores of Mandakini river, a tributary of Ganga, is a stone edifice of unknown date.It is not certain who built the original Kedarnath temple and when. The name “Kedarnath” means “the lord of the field”: it derives from the Sanskrit words kedara (“field”) and natha (“lord”). The text Kashi Kedara Mahatmya states that it is so called because “the crop of liberation” grows here. According to a mythological account, the god Shiva agreed to dwell here at the request of Nara-Narayana.[9] After the Kurukshetra War, the Pandava brothers, came here to meet Shiva on the advice of the sage Vyasa, because they wanted to seek forgiveness for killing their kin during the war. However, Shiva did not want to forgive them: so, he turned into a bull and hid among the cattle on the hill. When the Pandavas managed to track him, he tried to disappear by sinking himself head-first into the ground. One of the brothers grabbed his tail, forcing him to appear before them and forgive them. The Pandava brothers then built the first temple at Kedarnath. The portions of Shiva’s body later appeared at four other locations; and collectively, these five places came to be known as the five Kedaras (“Panch Kedar”); the head of the bull appeared at the location of the Pashupatinath Temple in present-day Nepal.The Mahabharata, which gives the account of the Pandavas and the Kurukshetra War, does not mention any place called Kedarnath. One of the earliest references to Kedarnath occurs in the Skanda Purana (c. 7th-8th century), which contains a myth describing the origin of the Ganges river. The text names Kedara (Kedarnath) as the place where Shiva released the holy water from his matted hair. According to the hagiographies based on Madhava’s Sankshepa-shankara-vijaya, the 8th century philosopher Adi Shankara died at Kedaranatha (Kedarnath); although other hagiographies, based on Anandagiri’s Prachina-Shankara-Vijaya, state that he died at Kanchi. The ruins of a monument marking the purported death place of Shankara are located at Kedarnath. Kedarnath was definitely a prominent pilgrimage centre by the 12th century, when it is mentioned in Kritya-kalpataru written by the Gahadavala minister Bhatta Lakshmidhara. According to a tradition recorded by the English mountaineer Eric Shipton (1926), “many hundreds of years ago”, the Kedarnath temple did not have a local priest: the priest of the Badrinath temple used to hold services at both the temples, traveling between the two places daily.
Gaurikund is the last motorable point before Kedarnath. From here, it’s 14km up the mountains. One can walk up, ride a pony, or be hauled up in a palanquin. Alternatively, you can take a very short helicopter ride from Sirsi, Phata or Guptakashi and then walk up the short distance to seek the blessings of Shiva.

https://www.bharattemples.com/guptakashi-rudraprayag-uttrakhand/,"Guptakashi, Rudraprayag, Uttrakhand
Guptakashi, Gupta Kashi or Guptkashi is a fairly large town located at an elevation of 1,319 metres (4,327 ft) in the Kedar-khanda (‘khanda’ means “sector”), in Garhwal Himalayas of Rudraprayag district in Uttrakhand, India. It is known for its ancient Vishwanath Temple dedicated to the god Shiva, which is similar to the one in Varanasi (Kashi). The other well known temple here is dedicated to Ardhanareshvara, a half man half woman form of Shiva and Parvati. The name Guptakashi has legendary significance linked to the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata.Its religious importance is considered next to that of Varanasi, believed to be the most pious of all Hindu pilgrimage places.
The temple town is located on the way to the Kedarnath, one of the Chota Char Dhams and Panch Kedars. It has the scenic backdrop of the snow-covered peaks of Chaukhamba and enjoys a salubrious weather throughout the year.
The main temple is dedicated to Shiva as Vishwanath (ruler of the world). The architectural style of this temple is akin to other temples in Uttrakhand, such as Kedarnath, built in stone with a high tower over the sanctum and a wooden frame and sloping roof in typical architectural style of the region, at the top of the tower. At the entrance to the temple, there are two dwarpalakas (entrance guards) on both sides. The exterior façade is painted with lotuses. At the top of the entrance door, there is an image of Bhairava, a terrible form of Shiva. To the left of the main shrine, there is a smaller shrine dedicated to Ardhanareeshvara and at the entrance to this temple there is metallic statue of Nandi facing Shiva’s image in the temple and offering reverential worship. This statue has a Swastika, a typical Hindu symbol, painted on its side, with its arms aligned in a clockwise direction, considered as an auspicious direction.
Apart from the main Vishwanath temple, a large number of Lingas, symbols of Shiva, are seen in and around Guptakashi, which has resulted in the popular terminology ‘jitne pathar utne shankar’ meaning “as many stones, those many ‘Shiva’s”. Another temple town called the Ukhimath is located on the opposite bank of the Mandakini river where, during the winter months when Kedarnath temple is inaccessible due to snowy conditions, the symbolic deity of Kedarnath is shifted via Gaurikund, Phata, Guptakashi to Ukhimath to continue worship uninterrupted. The temple priests of Kedarnath stay at Guptakashi during the winter period.
In a small pond (kund) called the Manikarnika Kund here, in front of the temple, a Shiva-linga is bathed by two springs, representing the rivers Ganges (Bhagirathi) and Yamuna. The Yamuna spring water emanates from a goumukh (spout in the shape of a cow’s mouth) and the Bhagirathi spring flows through trunk of an elephant strategically placed above the linga.
In addition, there are few other important sites to visit in the vicinity of the temple town. These are the Gandhi Sarovar (lake) 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from the town where the ashes of Mahatma Gandhi were immersed. Vasukital, 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) from Kedarnath, is yet another enchanting lake that beholds the visitor with floating ice and sparkling water.
At Ukhimath, on the opposite bank of the river, there is a stupa, which according to the local version represents the grave of Nala. There are also evidences of a love legend narrated, locally only, of Krishna’s grand son Aniruddha and demon king Banasura’s daughter Usha at Ramgarh (in Ronitpur), near Ukhimath, about3 kilometres (1.9 mi) away from Guptakashi. This love affair led to a war between Krishna and Banasura in which the latter was killed, resulting in the end of Banasura’s dynasty.
Popularly-narrated legend holds that subsequent to the Kurukshetra war of the epic Mahabharata, the Pandavas on the advice of god Krishna and other sages wished to atone for their sins of fratricide and Brāhmanahatya committed by them during the war by seeking pardon from Shiva and also pray for his blessings before attaining salvation. But Shiva was not willing to meet them since he was annoyed with them for the unjust events of the war. He, therefore, avoided meeting them at Kashi and went incognito as the bull Nandi to Guptakashi in Uttarakhand. But Pandavas pursued him to Guptakashi and recognized him in the disguised form of Nandi. When Bhima, the second Pandava brother tried to hold the bull by its tail and hind legs, Nandi vanished from Guptakashi, into the ground (into a cave for hiding), but reappeared later as Shiva in five different forms namely, hump at Kedarnath, face at Rudranath, arms at Tungnath, navel and stomach at Madhyamaheshwar and the locks at Kalpeshwar. The vanishing act of Shiva gave the name Guptakashi (hidden Kashi) to this place on the bank of the Mandakini River. In the upper reaches of the Bhagirathi River, there is another Kashi, called the Uttarkashi (North Kashi).
Mythology also states that Shiva proposed to Parvati at Guptakashi before they got married in the small Triyuginarayan village at the confluence of Mandakini and Sone-Ganga rivers However the old route of 14 km from Gauri Kund to Kedarnath via Rambara was completely washed away in the 2013 North India floods, and new route of 15-16 km was made by the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering (NIM). The distance of Guptakashi to Kedarnath however remains at 22 kilometers and 729.77 meters, which is most important to the celestial nupitials.
According to Puranic literature, Kashi and Kanchi (Kanchipuram) are considered as two eyes of Shiva. Keeping this connotation in view, six more “Kashi”s have been prescribed to be as sacred and spiritual as the main Kashi – Varanasi. Pilgrims, who cannot undertake the long journey to the main Kashi, can travel to the closest Kashi. The six other “Kashi”s cover all the regions of the country. These are: Uttarkashi and Guptakashi in Uttarakhand in Northern Himalayas, Dakshinkashi in southern India, the Guptakashi in eastern India is at Bhubaneswar, the Kashi at Nashik (also Paithan) in western India and a Kashi in Mandi in Himachal Pradesh in Western Himalayas. The Puranas state that all the Kashis have the same degree of sanctity and reverence as the main Kashi – Varanasi.
Another legend declares that when the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb demolished the Kashi Vishwanath Temple in 1669, and constructed Gaynvapi Mosque (he had even renamed Varanasi as Mohammadâbâd), the Shiva Linga was shifted to Guptakashi for safe keeping. But the original linga of Kashi Vishwanath is stated to have remained here from the time it was shifted

It is named after King Daksha Prajapati, the father of Sati. Daksha is one of the fourteen Prajapatis, creator deities, who preside over procreation and are the protector of life in Hindu mythology.
The present temple was built by Queen Dhankaur in 1810 and rebuilt in 1962. It is a place of pilgrimage for Shaivaite devotees on Maha Shivaratri
Daksheshwara Mahdeva temple is one of the most revered temples of the state of Uttarakhand, India. This one of the most ancient temples of India is dedicated to worshiping Lord Shiva. The devotees of Lord Shiva particularly during the month of Saavan visit the temple in large numbers to get a glimpse of their favourite Lord. This temple in Uttarakhand in Kankhal, Harydwar has been named after Daksha who was a king and the father of Sati. The temple was built in 1810 AD by the queen Dankor and was later on reconstructed in the year 1962.
It is said that King Daksha after whome the temple had been named was born to Lord Brahma and was Sati’s father. Sati is believed to be the first wife of Lord Shiva and her father Daksha had once organized a Yagna at the place where the temple had been built, he invited all the deities there but he did not invite Lord Shiva. Upon which Sati felt a sense of insult for her husband and out of rage she jumped into the Agni Kund and she died. When Lord Shiva came to know about the death of Sati, he became very furious and called for a war by sending his disciples, Bhadrakali, Veerbhdra and Ganas to the site. During the war, king Daksha’s head was cut by Veerbhadra, but upon request from all the deities to forgive him, Lord Shiva restored his life by adding the head of a goat in the body of king Daksha and the king also realised his mistake.
Standing next to the main temple is the Das Mahavidya temple, dedicated to the Mahavidyas. It is a venue for devotees of Devi to congregate for special pujas during the Navratri celebrations. There is also a temple in the complex dedicated to Ganga river. Next to the temple is the Daksha Ghat on the Ganges and close by is the Nileshwar Mahadev Temple.

After all this, Lord Shiva said that, he would be present here at Kankhal every year during the time of Saavan and so a temple named Daksheswar Mahadeva was built at the site of the yagna. It is believed that, the yagna Kund where Sati went into the fire is still located at the same place. Devotees from different parts of the country come here to worship lord shiva and they also take holy dip into the Great River Ganga. The Hindu scripture, Vayu-Purana has the mention of the Yagna that king Daksha had organized.
After the body of the king Daksha was restored, Lord Shiva out of grief took the body of his beloved and wandered across the universe. It is believed that Lord Vishnu in order to separate Lord Shiva from the grief and separate him from the dead body of Sati, shopped off her body. All the places where the parts of the body of Sati feel became Shakti Peeths and people started celebrating those places.
As mentioned in the Mahabharata and other texts of Hinduism, King Daksha Prajapati, the father of Sati, Shiva’s first wife, performed yajna at the place where the temple is situated. Although Sati felt insulted when her father did not invite Shiva to the ritual, she attended the yajna. She found that Shiva was being spurned by her father and she burnt herself in the Yajna Kunda itself. Shiva got angry and sent his Gaṇas, the terrible demi-god Virabhadra and Bhadrakali to the ritual.On the direction of Shiva, Virabhadra appeared with Shiva’s ganas in the midst of Daksha’s assembly like a storm wind and waged a fierce war with the gods and mortals present culminating in the beheading of Daksha, who was later given the head of a goat at the behest of Brahma and other gods. Much of the details of the Ashvamedha Yagna (Horse Sacrifice) of Daksha are found in the Vayu Purana.

Mahasu Devta Temple is on the eastern bank of Tons River (Tamas) at Hanol village, near Chakrata, about 190 km from Dehradun and 156 km from Mussoorie.
Mahasu Devta is not only the sole arbiter over the mortals, he also reigns supreme over the innumerable indigenous gods and goddesses. He exercises his authority over the religious dispensation of people and secular matters. Disputes among the people are settled through a unique LotaPani adjuration. For this purpose water is ritually filled in a metallic goblet in the name of Mahasu Devta by a neutral person, then the disputants are asked to drink that water in the name of Mahasu Devta. The party who has given the false statement suffers on drinking the water.
The age-old theocratic governance of Mahasu Devta, although acceptable to people and local rulers, was not taken kindly by the British authority. One of their officers, Major Young, found the authority of Mahasu Devta ‘a great nuisance’. During land settlement of the territory under the British control in AD 1827 he felt that the traditional twelve-year sojourning of Mahasu (the Chalda Mahasu) with his large entourage to deitydom was extremely burdensome and exploitative to common people. To check the practice, Young passed a summary order in Kalsi in an assembly of the Senyanas banishing the Chalda Mahasu and his deputy attendants (birs) from Jaunsar and Bawar parangna. That order, however, did not have lasting effect because the people regarded the Rohru tehsil for his verdict. The deity decision is always regarded as final and irrevocable.
Mahasu Devta is very touchy about the disposal of gold or gold ornaments by anyone of his subject to outsiders. The person involved in such offence may suffer the loss of property, a serious disease, or even life until he gets it back intact. However, that does not absolve the defaulter from the crime. As a punishment the defaulter is obliged to deposit the article in the treasury of deity. Therefore, the people in the deitydom have to be very careful about the transaction of silver and gold articles outside his realm. It is believed that the bullion in the Mahasudom, even if in the possession of people, belongs to the deity. If such gold goes outside his deitydom the person doing so provokes the ire of Mahasu Devta.
Mahasu Devta appears in quadruple form as the four brothers. The legend tells when Krishna disappeared at the end of DwaparYuga the pandavas followed him. They cross the River Tons. Yudhishtra was fascinated by the beauty of place and asked Vishwakarma to build a temple here and stay with Draupadi for nine days. The place subsequently came to known as Hanol, after the name of Huna Bhatt.
At the start of Kaliyuga demons wandered over Uttrakhand devouring people and devastating villages. The greatest demon was Kirmir who had devoured all the seven sons of a pious-hearted Brahmin named Huna Bhatt. Demon cast an evil eye and desired to have the Kirtaka wife of the Brahmin; she prayed to Lord Shiva to protect her chastity. Lord Shiva blinded Kirmir and thus she could run away to her husband. They then prayed to Hatkeshwari Devi of Hatkoti (ashtbhuji Durga) who advised the couple to go to the Kashmir mountains and offer prayer to Lord Shiva to help. They did, and Lord Shiva granted them their wish that all the evils will be killed shortly.
Huna Bhatt was told to go back to his home and perform certain rituals and worship devi. On doing so the shakti emerged from the ground with flames around and told Huna Bhatt to plough every Sunday a part of his field with a plough of solid silver with a shoe of pure gold having yoked a pair of bullocks who had never been put on yoke before. On the seventh Sunday the Mahasu brothers with their ministers and the army will come out and rid the people from the clutches of demon. Huna Bhatt did accordingly, but on sixth Sunday when he had turned on five furrows out of each sprang a deity from the first came Botha from second Pavasi, out of third Vasik and Chalda from the fourth one. All the brothers were called by a common affix of Mahasu (Char Mahasu). From the fifth furrow appeared their heavenly mother Devladli Devi and their ministers. Countless army sprang out like mushrooms from the field. Huna Bhatt did as directed and the whole army of the demon was killed by Mahasu brothers. Kirmir was taken by Chalda Devta in a ravine of Mount Khanda. The marks of his sword on the rock can be seen today.
During the absence of the Mahasu brothers, demon Keshi took control of Hanol. Chalda Devta and his warriors Shitkulia, Kaolu and others set out with the army to the mountains of Masmor where Keshi had gone. The demon was killed; Chalda Devta returned jubilantly to visit with his heroes the places named by him. He divided the country among the brothers so that they may rule their respective territory and guard against calamities of all the people who would worship them as god and perform jagara.
However, a mistake erupted in the venture of the Mahasu brothers. In the beginning, Mahasu Devta had pledged their word to Huna Bhatt that they would appear on the seventh Sunday. Since they arrived a week earlier, the Mahasu brothers were hurt by the blade of Huna Bhatt’s plough — he was in the field unaware of their untimely arrival. As a result, Botha was hurt in the knee and became unable to walk. Vasik’s eye was damaged by the blade of grass which impaired his vision. Pavasi had a small piece cut out of his ear. Only Chalda and Devladli Mata remained unhurt. Thereafter Botha preferred to settle within his temple at Hanol on the right bank of river tons. Pavasi keep moving over his domain and spend years turn by turn at Hanol, Lakhmandal, Authana and Uttarkashi. Chalda, being sound of limb, was to exercise away in the whole dominion in the Botha Mahasu name — twelve years on end he roamed among his subjects.

Baleshwar Temple is ancient temple dedicated to Shiva, situated within city of Champawat in Uttarakhand.Built by the rulers of the Chand dynasty, Baleshwar Temple is a marvelous symbol of stone carving. There are not any historical manuscripts that date the Baleshwar temple; however, it is believed to have been built between the 10th and 12th century AD.
The temple is situated in Baleshwar i.e 76 km from Pithoragarh within the city of Champawat in Uttarakhand. It is the most artistic temple of the area. Built by the rulers of Chand dynasty, Baleshwar Temple is a marvelous symbol of stone carving. The main Baleshwar temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva who is also known as Baleshwar. There are two other temples in the compound of Baleshwar, one dedicated to Ratneshwar and the other to Champawati Durga. The exteriors of these temples are carved with posters of local deities.
The temple is an example of South Indian Architecture with magnificent stone carving works. There was a freshwater resource ‘Naula’ which has dried up now. This temple has been declared a National Heritage Monument and is looked after by the Archeological Survey of India(ASI) since 1952. It is constructed in south Indian construction style. The temple once had intricate structural features and a sanctuary with a mandap. The intricate carvings are still visible on the ceilings of these temples. It is an evidence of their ancient glory and artistic excellence. The first story of Man-Eaters of Kumaon is related to this place.
It is said that the ancient capital of the Chand rulers is well known for its temples and natural beauty. Champawat district is a source and origin of religion and culture of Uttarakhand. It was in Champawat that Lord Vishnu is said to have appeared as ‘Kurma avatar’. Hence, Kumaon also came to be known as Kurmanchal.  This isn’t any historical manuscript that dates the Baleshwar temple; however it is believed to have been built between the tenth and twelfth century AD. The legends associated to the temple relate to several Gods and Goddess. It has acquired the unique distinction of being the holy land of Gods and therefore, temples of very large variety dedicated to diverse gods including local deities and demons of restricted influence are spread over the whole expanse.
By Road
Champawat is accessible by road as well, however, the journey by road is very tedious and not much recommended. Champawat is about 455 km from Delhi. The shortest route will be to first reach Haldwani (294 km) then to Bhowali (29 km from Haldwani) and then via Bhowali to Champawat ( 132 km from Bhowali) but the terrain makes it an unfavorable bet to travel by road. Better options would be by train or flight, but if you’re willing to go by road, be prepared for a tough ride.
By Rail
Regular trains like the Sampark Kranti, Shatabdi and the Garib Rath that pass through the Kathgodam station, that is about 58 kms away from Champawat and the Tanakpur station, about 75 kms away. Your best bet is to cover the distance between is to take a tourist bus, since many individual cab drivers are not ready to drive to Champawat, since it’s a lesser known tourist destination.
By Air
The nearest airport is located at Pantnagar, about 160 kms away, from where you can easily hire cabs, taxis, minivans, buses : both private and government run to reach Champawat.

Tungnath is the highest Shiva temple in the world and is the highest of the five Panch Kedar temples located in the mountain range of Tunganath in Rudraprayag district, in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The Tunganath (literal meaning: Lord of the peaks) mountains form the Mandakini and Alaknanda river valleys. It is located at an altitude of 3,460 m (11,352 ft), and just below the peak of Chandrashila. The temple is believed to be 5000 years old and is the third (Tritiya Kedar) in the pecking order of the Panch Kedars. It has a rich legend linked to the Pandavas, heroes of the Mahabharata epic.
According to Hindu mythology Lord Shiva and his consort Parvati both reside in the Himalayas: Lord Shiva resides at Mount Kailash. Parvati is also called Shail Putri which means ‘daughter of hills’.
The Tunganath is indelibly linked to the origin of the Panch Kedar temples built by the Pandavas. The legend states that sage VyasRishi advised the Pandavas that since they were culpable of slaying their own relatives (Kauravas, their cousins) during the Mahabharata war or Kurukshetra war, their act could be pardoned only by Lord Shiva. Consequently, the Pandavas went in search of Shiva who was avoiding them since he was convinced of the guilt of Pandavas. In order to keep away from them, Shiva took the form of a bull and went into hiding in an underground safe haven at Guptakashi, where Pandavas chased him. But later Shiva’s body in the form of bull’s body parts rematerialized at five different locations that represent the “Panch Kedar” where Pandavas built temples of Lord Shiva at each location, to worship and venerate, seeking his pardon and blessings. Each one is identified with a part of his body; Tungnath is identified as the place where the bahu (hands) were seen: hump was seen at Kedarnath; head appeared at Rudranath; his navel and stomach surfaced at Madhyamaheshwar; and his jata (hair or locks) at Kalpeshwar.[3][4][5][6]
Legend also states that Lord Rama, the chief icon of the Ramayana epic, meditated at the Chandrashila peak, which is close to Tungnath. It is also said that Ravana did penance to Shiva, the lord of the peaks, when he resided here.

Kalpeshwar is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva located at an elevation of 2,200 m (7,217.8 ft) in the picturesque Urgam valley in the Garhwal region of Uttarakhand state in India. The temple’s ancient legend linked to the Pandavas, heroes of epic Mahabharata eminence is the fifth temple of the Panch Kedars (five temples) of Shiva’s five anatomical divine forms; the other four temples in the order of their worship are Kedarnath, Rudranath, Tungnath and Madhyamaheshwar temples; all in the Kedar Khand region of the Garhwal Himalayas. Kalpeshwar is the only Panch Kedar temple accessible throughout the year. At this small stone temple, approached through a cave passage, the matted tress (jata) of Lord Shiva is worshipped. Hence, Lord Shiva is also called as Jatadhar or Jateshwar. Earlier it was approachable only by 12 km (7.5 mi) trek from the nearest road head of Helang on the Rishikesh-Badrinath road but now the road goes up to Devgram village from where the trek now is just 300 metres. This road is good for bikes or cars with good ground clearance as it is half kuccha road which may get damaged during monsoons. Small cars can be taken except in monsoons.
In Kalpeshwar Temple Lord Shiva is worshipped in his divine form of Jatas (Hairs). It is believed that in ancient times when Pandvas did Kurukshetra war and killed their relatives and brothers. Then they wanted to get pardoned by Lord Shiva but Lord Shiva didn’t want to meet them as he was convinced that they were dishonest and did a fratricidal sin. So Lord Shiva transformed in to a incognito form of bull. And then reappeared at the five places of Panch Kedars in divine forms. Like this his Jatas (Hair Locks) appeared at Kalpeshwar. Pandvas built a temple at this place to worship Lord Shiva and to please him.
The epic legend narrated on the creation of the Panch Kedar temples is that Pandavas of Mahabharata epic history, while chasing Lord Shiva to seek his pardon for the fratricidal sins committed by them during the Kurukshetra war, realized that Shiva, in order to distance himself from the Pandavas, took the incognito form of a bull. But when this form of Shiva was discerned by Bhima, the second of the Pandava brothers, tried to hold on to the bull’s tail and hind legs. But the bull vanished underground at Guptakashi. Subsequently, it reappeared in five different forms: His hump appeared at Kedarnath, his bahu (arm) was spotted at Tungnath, his head surfaced at Rudranath, the stomach and navel were traced at Madhyamaheswar and his jata (tress) was divined at Kalpeshwar. Another legend states that this place was much preferred by sages of folklore for meditation. Particular mention is made of sage Arghya who through his austere penance created Urvashi, the famous apsara (nymph) at this place. Durvasa, an ancient sage, son of Atri and Anasuya, considered an incarnation of Shiva, known for his short temper did penance and meditated under the Kalpavriksha, the wish fulfilling divine tree in the precincts of the temple.Further, it is said that Durvasa had given Kunti, mother of Pandavas, a boon that “she could invoke any of the forces of nature and they would appear before her and grant whatever she desired”. Once, when Pandavas, were in exile here, in order to test them Durvasa visited them along with his disciples and desired to be dined by them. Unfortunately, there was no food available within the house to feed the surprise guests. Draupadi, wife of Pandavas, sought Lord Krishna’s help. Krishna materialised on the scene and solved the problem.
Kalpeshwar is only 253Kms away from Rishikesh via Rishikesh-Badrinath road. Earlier the trek was from Helang to Kalpeshwar via Urgam Village (10Kms Trek). But as per now a motorable road has been built up to Urgam from Helang. So after that only 2Kms trek remains up to Kalpeshwar. Itis the only temple of Panch Kedar which is accessible throughout the year.
By Road: Kalpeshwar can be reashed up to Helang, 243 kms. on the Rishikesh – Badrinath road by bus and taxis. From Helang, the 12 kms. trek is off the main road.
Boodha Kedar temple surrounded by potato fields is seen on the trek route. Also seen is the Dhyan Badri temple at Urgam Village, one of the Sapt Badri (seven Badri) temples.

Jyotirmath, also known as Joshimath is a city and a municipal board in Chamoli District in the Indian state of Uttarakhand.  It is located at a height of 6150 feet. It is a gateway to several Himalayan mountain climbing expeditions, trekking trails and pilgrim centres like Badrinath. It is a home to one of the four cardinal pithas established by Adi Shankara.
Jyotirmath is the uttaramnaya matha or northern monastery, one of the four cardinal institutions established by Adi Shankara, the others being those at Shringeri, Puri and Dwarka. Their heads are titled “Shankaracharya”. They are considered to be the leaders of the ten orders of the Dasanami Sannyasins associated with Advaita Vedanta. The principal eastern (Purvamnaya), southern (Dakshinamnaya) and western (Pascimamnaya) institutions are based at Puri (Orissa), Sringeri (Karnataka) and Dwaraka (Gujarat) respectively. The northern (Uttaramnaya) Sankaracharya seat is at Jyotirmath (also known as Joshimath) near Badrinath. In addition to these four, there are numerous other mathas throughout India, and the seven Dasanami Akhadas (Juna, Niranjani, Mahanirvani, Ananda, Atal, Avahan, Agni – the last is a Brahmacharin Akhada, not a Sannyasin one) that have their own separate administrations and leaders. According to the tradition initiated by Adi Shankara, this matha is in charge of the Atharva veda. Jyotirmath is close to the pilgrimage town of Badrinath. This place can be a base station for travellers going to Guru Gobind Ghat or the Valley of Flowers National Park. The temple Narasimha is enshrined Badrinarayan along with a pantheon of deities.

The history of Jyotirmath is extremely complicated. According to official accounts, after the period of one Swami Ramakrishna Tirtha in the 18th century, the matha was extinct for about 165 years, before it was revived in 1941, under Swami Brahmananda Saraswati. However, in the meantime, various Sannyasins had claimed to be the Sankaracharya of Jyotirmath, and for some time, many people thought that the Rawal (head-priest) of the Badrinath temple was also the Sankaracharya of Jyotirmath.
Between 7th and 11th centuries C.E., Katyuri kings, who were originally from Joshimath, ruled the area of varying extent from their capital at “Katyur” (modern day Baijnath) valley in Kumaon, including from Brahmadev Mandi in Nepal in the east to Kabul in Afghanistan in the west, before fragmenting into numerous principalities by the 12th century.The Katyuri dynasty was founded by Vashudev Katyuri, ancient Basdeo temple at Joshimath is attributed to Vasu Dev. Vasu Dev was of Buddhist origin, but later followed Brahminical practices and the brahminical practices of Katyuri kings in general is sometimes attributed to a vigorous campaign of Adi Shankara (788-820 CE).
Katyuri kings were displaced by the Chand Kings in the 11th century AD

The temple stands out in its architectural proficiency; it is topped by a magnificent dome and the 30 sq ft (2.8 m2) sanctum sanctorum, which is aessible by 24 doors.
The remains of broken idols found around the temple testify the existence of several more temples in ancient times. There is a trident, in the courtyard of the temple, about 5 m high, made of eight different metals, which dates back to the 12th century. It boasts the inscriptions attributed to Anekmalla, the king of Nepal who reigned in the 13th century. Four short inscriptions written in Devanagri, which dates back to a later period, are yet to be deciphered, barring one. Legend is that the trident got fixed in this spot, when Lord Shiva threw it at Lord Kama to kill him. The metal of the trident is not weathered by the elements and this is a wonder. The legend goes that the trident belonged to Shiva who threw it at Kamdeva (The God Of Love) to kill him and it got fixed in this spot. It is believed that while brute force can not move this Trident, the slightest touch by a true devotee can cause a tremor in it. The metal of the trident does not appear to have become weathered by the elements over the century.

Another legend says that, when Lord Shiva turned Kamdev into ashes, Rati, the wife of Kamdeva, did penance at Gopeshwar. Pleased with her devotion, Lord Shiva appeared at Gopeshwar. Shiva blessed her with a boon that her husband will reappear.
Another hearsay is that, when Shiva was annihilating the Kshatriyas, the trident of Parshuram broke into 3 parts while pacifying Lord Shiva. A part of that trident is found in Gopinath temple.

https://www.bharattemples.com/badrinath-temple-chamoli-uttarakhand/,"Badrinath Temple, Chamoli, Uttarakhand
Badrinath or Badrinarayan Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu which is situated in the town of Badrinath in Uttarakhand, India. The temple and town form one of the four Char Dham and Chota Char Dham pilgrimage sites. The temple is also one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Badrinath—holy shrines for Vaishnavites. It is open for six months every year (between the end of April and the beginning of November), because of extreme weather conditions in the Himalayanregion. The temple is located in Garhwal hill tracks in Chamoli district along the banks of Alaknanda River at an elevation of 3,133 m (10,279 ft) above the mean sea level. It is one of the most visited pilgrimage centers of India, having recorded 1,060,000 visits.
The image of the presiding deity worshipped in the temple is a 1 m (3.3 ft) tall, the black stone statue of Vishnu in the form of Badrinarayan. The statue is considered by many Hindus to be one of eight swayam vyakta kshetras, or self-manifested statues of Vishnu.
Mata Murti Ka Mela, which commemorates the descent of river Ganges on mother earth, is the most prominent festival celebrated in the Badrinath Temple. Although Badrinath is located in North India, the head priest, or Rawal, is traditionally a Nambudiri Brahminchosen from the South Indian state of Kerala. The temple was included in the Uttar Pradesh state government Act No. 30/1948 as Act no. 16,1939, which later came to be known as Shri Badarinath and Shri Kedarnath Mandir Act. The committee nominated by the state government administers both the temples and has seventeen members on its board.
The temple is mentioned in ancient religious texts like Vishnu Purana and Skanda Purana. It is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, an early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th–9th centuries AD.
There is no historical record about the temple, but there is a mention of the presiding deity Badrinath in Vedic scriptures(c. 1750–500 bc). According to some accounts, the temple was a Buddhist shrine till the 8th century and Adi Shankaraconverted it to a Hindu temple.The architecture of the temple resembling that of a Buddhist vihara (temple) and the brightly painted facade which is atypical of Buddhist temples leads to the argument.Other accounts relate that it was originally established as a pilgrimage site by Adi Shankara in the ninth century. It is believed that Shankara resided in the place for six years from ad 814 to 820. He resided six months in Badrinath and the rest of the year in Kedarnath. Hindu followers assert that he discovered the image of Badrinath in the Alaknanda River and enshrined it in a cave near the Tapt Kund hot springs. A traditional story asserts that Shankara expelled all the Buddhists in the region with the help of the Parmar ruler king Kanak Pal. The hereditary successors of the king governed the temple and endowed villages to meet its expenses. The income from a set of villages on the route to the temple was used to feed and accommodate pilgrims. The Parmar rulers held the title “Bolanda Badrinath”, meaning speaking Badrinath. They had other titles, including Shri 108 Basdrishcharyaparayan Garharaj Mahimahendra, Dharmabibhab, and Dharamarakshak Sigamani.
The throne of Badrinath was named after the presiding deity; the king enjoyed ritual obeisance by the devotees before proceeding to the shrine. The practice was continued until the late 19th century. During the 16th century, the King of Garhwalmoved the murti to the present temple.When the state of Garhwal was divided, the Badrinath temple came under British rule but the king of Garhwal continued as the chairman of the management committee.The selection of priest is done after consultation between Garhwal and Travancore royal families.
The temple has undergone several major renovations due to its age and damage by an avalanche. In the 17th century, the temple was expanded by the Kings of Garhwal. After significant damage in the great 1803 Himalayan earthquake, it was largely rebuilt by the King of Jaipur.It was still under renovation as late as the 1870s but these were completed by the time of the First World War. At that time, the town was still small, consisting of only the 20-odd huts housing the temple’s staff, but the number of pilgrims was usually between seven and ten thousand.The Kumbh Meld festival held every twelve years raised the number of visitors to 50,000.The temple also enjoyed revenue from the rents owed to it by various villages bequeathed by various rajas.
During 2006, the state government announced the area around Badrinath as a no construction zone to curb illegal encroachment.
The temple is located in Garhwal hill tracks along the banks of the Alaknanda River in Chamoli district in Uttarakhand, a state in North India. The hill tracks are located 3,133 m (10,279 ft) above the mean sea level. The Nar Parbat mountain is located opposite to the temple, while the Narayana Parbat is located behind the Neelakanta peak.
The temple has three structures: the Garbhagriha (sanctum), the Darshan Mandap (worship hall), and Sabha Mandap (convention hall).The conical-shaped roof of the sanctum, the garbhagriha, is approximately 15 m (49 ft) tall with a small cupola on top, covered with a gold gilt roof.The facade is built of stone and has arched windows. A broad stairway leads up to the main entrance, a tall, arched gateway. Just inside is a mandap, a large, pillared hall that leads to the sanctum, or main shrine area. The walls and pillars of the hall are covered with intricate carvings.
The main shrine houses the 1 m (3.3 ft) Shaligram (black stone) idol of Lord Badrinarayana, which is housed in a gold canopy under a Badri Tree. The idol of Lord Badrinarayana shows Him holding a Shankha (conch) and a Chakra (wheel) in two of His arms in a lifted posture and the other two arms resting on His lap in a Yogamudra (Padmasana) posture. The sanctum also houses images of the god of wealth—Kubera, sage Narada, Uddhava, Nar and Narayan. There are fifteen more images that are also worshipped around the temple. These include that of Lakshmi (the consort of Vishnu), Garuda (the vahana of Narayan), and Navadurga, the manifestation of Durga in nine different forms. The temple also has shrines of Lakshmi Narasimhar and for saints Adi Shankara (ad 788-820), Nar and Narayan,Ghantakarna, Vedanta Desika and Ramanujacharya. All the idols of the temple are made of black stone.
The Tapt Kund, a group of hot sulfur springs just below the temple, are considered to be medicinal; many pilgrims consider it a requirement to bathe in the springs before visiting the temple. The springs have a year-round temperature of 55 °C (131 °F), while outside temperature is typically below 17 °C (63 °F) all year round.The two water ponds in the temple are called Narad Kund and Surya Kund.
According to Hindu legend, god Vishnu sat in meditation at this place. During his meditation, Vishnu was unaware of cold weather. Lakshmi, his consort, protected him in the form of the Badri tree (jujube or Indian date). Pleased by the devotion of Lakshmi, Vishnu named the place Badrika Ashram. According to Atkinson (1979), the place used to be a jujube forest, which is not found there today. Vishnu in the form of Badrinath is depicted in the temple sitting in the padmasana posture. According to the legend, Vishnu was chastised by sage Narada, who saw Vishnu’s consort, Lakshmi, massaging his feet. Vishnu went to Badrinath to perform austerity, meditating for a long time in padmasana.
The Vishnu Purana narrates another version of the origins of Badrinath. According to the tradition, Dharam had two sons, Nar, and Narayan—both of which are modern names of Himalayan mountains. They chose the place to spread their religion and each of them wed the spacious valleys in the Himalayas. Searching for an ideal place to set up a hermitage, they came across the other four Badris of the Pancha Badri, namely Bridha Badri, Yog Bhadri, Dhyan Badri and Bhavish Badri. They finally found the hot and cold spring behind the Alaknanda River and named it Badri Vishal.

https://www.bharattemples.com/jageshwar-temples-almora-uttarkhand/,"Jageshwar Temples, Almora, Uttarkhand
Jageshwar Temples, also referred to as Jageswar Temples or Jageshwar valley temples, are a group of over 100 Hindu temples dated between 7th and 12th century near Almora, in the Himalayan Indian state of Uttarakhand.The valley has a number of temple clusters such as the Dandeshwar and Jageshwar sites. Some locations have attracted construction of new temples through the 20th-century. Together these clusters over the valley consist of over 200 structural temples built from cut stone. Many are small, while a few are substantial. They predominantly illustrate North Indian Nagara style of architecture with a few exceptions that show South and Central Indian style designs, many are dedicated to god Shiva, while others in immediate vicinity are dedicated to god Vishnu, Shaktigoddesses and Surya traditions of Hinduism.
Jageshwar is a Hindu pilgrimage town and one of the Dhams (pilgrimage region) in the Shaivism tradition. The site is protected under Indian laws, and managed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). It includes Dandeshwar Temple, Chandi-ka-Temple, Jageshwar Temple, Kuber Temple, Mritunjaya Temple, Nanda Devi or Nau Durga, Nava-grah temple, a Pyramidal shrine, and Surya Temple. The site celebrates the Jageshwar Monsoon Festival during the Hindu calendar month of Shravan (overlaps with July-August) and the annual Maha Shivratri Mela (Shivratri festival), which takes place in early spring.
There are other Hindu temples in the Himalayan region that are called Jageshwar Temple such as one in Dalash, Himachal Pradesh
Jageshwar is located 36 kilometres (22 mi) northeast of Almora, in the Kumaun region. The temples site is on the south of the road, across which is an eponymous village at an altitude of 1,870 m, in the Jataganga river valley near a Deodar forest (Cedrus deodara). The temple clusters begin starting from satellite road branching off east from the Artola village on the Almora–Pithoragarh highway, at the confluence (sangam) of two streams Nandini and Surabhi after they flow down the hills in the narrow valley.The site is about 3.5 kilometres (2.2 mi) long along the Jataganga rivulet, is a narrow forested valley of oaks, deodara, rhododendrons and pines. Around the valley is human habitation which provide services to the pilgrims and travelers visiting these temples or passing through to other sacred sites in the Uttarkhand region. The resident villages are Mokshadham, Dandeshwar, Jageswar and Koteshwar.
Jageshwar is about 100 kilometres (62 mi) southeast of the historic Baijnath Temple and about 100 kilometres (62 mi) northeast from the resort town of Nainital. It is mentioned in Hindu texts dated prior to the 10th-century as a tirtha (pilgrimage) site.
The nearest rail head is Kathgodam 125 km. Jageshwar has direct road links with Almora (35 km), Haldwani (131 km.), Pithoragarh (88 km) and Kathgodam. State transport, and private jeeps and taxis ply from these place for Jageshwar regularly.
The origins of the Jageshwar temples site are unclear. Its remote location has limited its studies and scholarly attention. The site shows evidence of different architectural styles and building periods for both temples and stone steles, which range from the 7th to the 12th century, and then in the modern times.Estimates for the same temple or stele varies widely, sometimes 1,400 years. According to the ASI, some belong to the post-Gupta or the second half of 1st millennium while others belong to the 2nd millennium. Some colonial era guesses attribute them to the Katyuri or Chand hill dynasties but there is no textual or epigraphical evidence to support or refute these proposals. Another prevailing theory is that Adi Shankara built some of these temples, but once again there is no textual or epigraphical evidence to support this claim. Instead, the architectural features and style of some of these Hindu temples is from early 7th century, which is about 50 to 100 years before Adi Shankara lived (c. 788-820 CE).
The lack of systematic studies of Indian temples and ruins in many parts of the remote Himalayan regions limits what can be said about the chronological sequence of monuments in the Jageshwar valley. According to Chanchani, it is likely that the valley had reached a prominent position in Indian architecture by the 10th century, with the earliest monuments from the 7th-century.
The valley has two major clusters of Hindu temples, and a number of roadside shrines. Of these some 151 temples have been numbered by ASI as protected pre-12th century monuments. The two largest groups are locally called as the Dandeshwar group temples (Dandeshwar samuh mandir, 15 temples) and the Jageshwar group temples (Jageshwar samuh mandir, 120 temples). Of these, temple number 37, 76 and 146 are the largest, all dated to the late centuries of the 1st millennium. In historic text, Jageshwar is also referred to as Yageshvara.
Jageshwar was once the center of Lakulish Shaivism, likely by monks and migrants who left the plains of the Indian subcontinent from places such as Gujarat and settled in the high mountains. The resemblance between Kumaoni language and Gujarati language probably hints at the fact that followers of Lakulish settled at Jageshwar. The temples site over time was positioned as and grew as a sacred geography in the form of northern (uttara) Kashi (Varanasi).

https://www.bharattemples.com/gokarna-uttara-kannada-karnataka/,"Gokarna, Uttara Kannada, Karnataka
Gokarna is a small temple town on the western coast of India in the Kumta taluk of Uttara Kannada district of the state of Karnataka.The main temple and deity is Lord Shiva, who is also known as Mahabaleshwara. This temple houses what is believed to be original image of Lord Shiva’s linga (Atmalinga). There are many other temples all over this small town. Ankola and Kumta on NH66 are the main towns near Gokarna and Bhatkal and Karwar are the main cities near Gokarna where almost all trains stops.
Gokarna is known as one of the seven important Hindu pilgrimage centers. It is on what was once an unspoiled beach near the estuary of the river Aghanashini. Recently, due to the influx of tourists, the character of the town has changed; it is no longer just a centre of pilgrimage, though large numbers of devotees visit to offer prayers and worship to Lord Shiva.
Due to its laid-back, unspoiled and rustic nature many younger western tourists started visiting Gokarna about a decade ago. The beaches around Gokarna were hardly used by the locals until these mainly western tourists started coming.Enterprising locals started stores and restaurants, and now the resorts also cater to wealthier tourists.
 
The earliest history of the city is in Tretayuga, Ravana (Demon/Asura King of Lanka) reaches Kailasa and performed rigorous penance to get the “Atma Linga” from Lord Shiva, as Ravana’s mother expressed a keen desire to worship the atmalinga of Lord Shiva.[5][6] After a long penance, Shiva gave the Atma linga to Ravana as a boon and instructs Ravana to carry it home by walk, that he should never place it on the earth even for a short while failing which the linga would get eternally embedded at the place where he broke his commands.
Lord Maha Vishnu learned that Ravana will become all powerful by worshipping the ‘Atma Linga’ and menace to the world and Ravana’s conviction that nobody could defeat him, once he acquired the very power of Shiva. Maha vishnu devised a plan to install the linga somewhere and as he thought that Lord Ganapati was alone capable of doing it, he along with all the gods pleased Ganapati to execute the plan. Lord Ganapati accepts and reaches Gokarna as a Brahmin boy.
As Ravana was nearing Gokarna, Maha Vishnu who had known well that Ravana was punctual in performing his periodical rites (Sandyavandhana), hides sun with his Sudarshana Chakra (Wheel). Thinking that it was time to perform the evening rites, Ravana finds a Brahmin boy and asked him to hold the Atmalinga in his hand till he came back after finishing the rites. Ganapati agreed to hold the linga on one condition that he would do so till he would be able to bear the weight of linga and that thereafter he would call Ravana three times and if failed to come to him by then he would place the linga on the earth.
Ganapati calls Ravana three times when he was performing his rites and places the linga on the earth and he vanished. The Atmalinga at once got firmly entrenched in the earth. Ravana learned that he had been tricked by the Gods. The depressed demon king Ravana was deeply agitated and tried to pull up the linga, but the linga did not budge a little. It resulted in his throwing the coverings of the Linga to Dhareshwara, Gunavanteshwara, Murudeshwara and Shejjeshwar temples. Ravana was unable to lift the linga from the ground again and called the Shiva linga as Mahabala, one with great strength, and ever since, the linga illustrious as Mahabaleshwara. Shiva learned all these from Vayu Deva, the god of wind, and came on to Earth with Goddess Parvathi devi and his train of Gods, he visited these five places and worshipped the linga which had now taken five forms. He acknowledged that these five places would be his “Pancha Kshetras” (Five Holy Places)
A sect of Brahmins fled from the Gomantak to escape forcible conversions by the Portuguese and British and settled in and around Gokarna in the 15th century. It was part of the Sodhe and Vijayanagar kingdoms. When the Konkan region — including Goa — was occupied by the Portuguese, it became part of their rule. A few temples were destroyed by the Portuguese in 1714, rebuilt in the 18th century, and under the supervision of Guru H. H. Shrimad Anandashram Swamiji in 1928.

https://www.bharattemples.com/attahas-temple-birbhum/,"In a far, far land, in a little village called Dakshindihi in Birbhum, West Bengal, lies a shrine dedicated to Adi Shakti- the female force of Hinduism. Situated on the banks of the river Ishani, the temple lies on the Labhpur to Ahmedpur Road which is a distance of about 15 km. The exact location of the temple is around 5 km prior to Ahmedpur.  The deity inside the temple is Maa Phullora. The Bhairav Vishwesh is said to be guarding her.
The temple has a stone deity that is around fifteen feet long –which, incidentally, symbolises the lower lip of the goddess. A natural pond that has now gone into disuse sits right adjacent to the temple complex. An interesting fact about this pond: Hanuman was said to have collected a hundred and eight lotuses from this very pond when Shree Rama needed them for worship of the Goddess Durga. Gracing the same temple complex is a beautiful marble idol of Mahadev sitting on a stone lotus. The temple in itself is an architectural marvel. Although not very large and extravagant, the temple has been done up artistically and is extremely pleasing to the eye.

The presiding deity of this temple of West Bengal is a form of Kali called “Kripamayee” the one who is merciful. It is another famous Kali temple in West Bengal and it was built in the year 1848 by a famous zamindar Jayaram who was a dedicated devotee of goddess Kali.
It is a colossal nabaratna (nine-spired) temple with twelve shrines dedicated to Shiva, Kali’s consort.
Of the twelve Shiva temples; six are on each side and they had a fresh coat of paint like the main temple. The twelve Shiva temples are dedicated to Pashupatinath; Biswanath; Baidyanath; Chandranath; Amarnath; Bhubaneswar; Adinath; Taraknath; Somnath; Kedarnath; Umananda and Rameswar. All the twelve aatchala Shiv mandirs are on a raised platform and a flight of stairs is there to reach there.
Traditional Bengali architecture mostly uses brick and wood, often reflecting the styles of the wood, bamboo and thatch styles of local vernacular architecture for houses. Decorative carved or moulded plaques of terracotta (the same material as the brick) are a special feature. The brick is extremely durable and disused ancient buildings were often used as a convenient source of materials by local people, often being stripped to their foundations over the centuries.
Kripamayee Kali Devi Temple was built in the town of Baranagar by Jay Mitra. This person was a famous landlord during the seventeenth century when places like Baranagar in West Bengal were populated by Dutch traders. Jay Mitra was a devout follower of Goddess Kali and being a devotee he decided to establish this Kripamayee Kali Temple in 1848. The Dakshineshwar Kali Temple, another famous Kali Temple of West Bengal, was built much later than this one, in 1855. So this is even more ancient. Baranagar has a rich heritage that flourished during this time period.
It is said that Swami Vivekananda visited this temple. Even the great Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the famous devotee of Goddess Kali too visited the temple several times. It is heard that he called the Kripamayee Kali Maa ‘Mashi’. Mashi in Bengali translates to a maternal aunt or more precisely mother’s sister. This is an interesting fact regarding this temple.
A large number of people assemble here on the day of Deepavali and fireworks are lit. Instead of anna bhog luchi bhog is offered to the Goddess.
Most of the Kali temples in Bengal celebrate the various Kali Pujas that are celebrated among the Bengalees. Though there is one big yearly Kali puja festival in Bengal, there are several others too. Kali Puja Dipantwika is the main celebration in the honor of Goddess Kali and mostly coincides with Diwali. This is celebrated on Amavasya, or newmoon day in Bengali month known as Kartika. This is usually the month of November. This Kali Puja is celebrated in a grand way in West Bengal and many devotees stay awake all night to worship the goddess at midnight. Two other kinds of Kali puja celebrations are held too in Bengal. One is Phalaharini Kali Puja and other is Ratanti Kali Puja. Ratanti Kali Puja is celebrated on Amavasya in the month of Magha and Phalaharini Kali Puja on Amavasya in the month of Jyestha.

Lake Kalibari” – One of the most famous religious seats of Bengal, where the remembrance of God was kindled by Sree Sree Haripada Chakroborty, our revered Gurudev,was established more than 60 years ago. For his spiritual sadhana and ardent love for the almighty mother – ‘Maa Kali’, suddenly the divine mother became an effulgence and a Light of Divinity, luminous like a thousand suns, and appeared in his thatched hut where mother Sree Sree 108 Karunamoyee Kalimata has been consecrated. The mind of Gurudev blossomed and bathed in such hued light of Divinity and, at the directive of the divine mother, Gurudev constructed a seat of five skulls (Panchamundi’s Ashan) for the performance of ‘Tantra Kriya’ to ensure the proper solace of mankind and, thus, dedicated his life to a vast Karmayagya.
In 1987, out of his innumerable disciples, Gurudev ultimately picked Sri Nitai Chandra Basu as his competent torchbearer and trained him for the advancement of his Karmayagya. Thus yesterday’s Karmayagya has been transformed into a present day Dharmayagya: A vast project for the construction of a ‘Temple Complex’.
To prepare the infrastructure Sri Basu devoted his 15 years of service and source and now has been able to obtain a temple plan and model prepared by a renowned temple Architect of India Padmashree Achyut Kanvinde, in consonance with Kolkata Municipal Corporation rules. The temple will be constructed upon a land of 15 cottahs (10800 sq.ft.), at 107/1, Dr Meghnad Saha Sarani, Kolkata – 700 029, West Bengal, India. The temple will be erected in a number of steps from the road, the height of the temple will be 42.5 feet from the ground level and the view of the facade will be splendid. Apart from temples for worship there will be an auditorium for discussions on religious, social and educational matters, as also for seminars and conferences.
A community hall for social and religious purposes; conference rooms for exchange of views and ideas on educational, social cultural and religious matters, guest rooms for stay, free medical advise and treatment centers, ambulance services, free help-line services for common people in their need, have also been conceived. Soon it will be a place of harmony for performing various archanas. Lake Kalibari was established by Sree Sree Haripada Chakroborty on 13th April, 1949 and during his lifetime he maintained the same temple and performed the Tantra Kriya for the solace of hundreds of thousands of people who approached him during their hour of need. Prior to his demise he appointed and nominated Sri Netai Chandra Basu as Executor cum sole Sebait by his last Will dated 11/12/1985 read with Codicil dated 14/06/1987 and since he is devoting his life for the benevolence of mankind at large who are assembling before him with grace of Divine Mother Karunamoyee Kailmata, popularly known as Lake Kalibari.

https://www.bharattemples.com/tarapith-birbhum-west-bengal/,"Tarapith, Birbhum, West Bengal
Tārāpīṭh is a Hindu temple town near Rampurhat in Birbhum district of the Indian state of West Bengal, known for its Tantrictemple and its adjoining cremation (Maha Smashan) grounds where sādhanā (tantric rituals) are performed. The Tantric Hindutemple is dedicated to the goddess Tara, a fearsome Tantric aspect of the Devi, the chief temples of Shaktism. Tarapith derives its name from its association as the most important centre of Tara worship and her cult.
Tarapith is also famous for Sadhak Bamakhepa, known as the avadhuta or “mad saint”, who worshipped in the temple and resided in the cremation grounds as a mendicant and practised and perfected yoga and the tantric arts under the tutelage of another famous saint, Kailashpathi Baba. Bamakhepa dedicated his entire life to the worship of Tara Maa. His ashram is also located in bank of Dwaraka river and close to the Tara temple.
The Tara temple in Tarapith steeped in the narrated myths is a medium-sized temple in the rural precincts of Bengal. Its fame as a pilgrimage centre with the deity of Tara enshrined in it is due to “the temple’s founding myths, its type of worship (which includes blood offerings), the hymns sung there, the powers of the nearby tank, and the inhabitants and rituals of the adjacent cremation ground”.
The temple base is thick with thick walls, built of red brick. The superstructure has covered passages with many arches raising to the pinnacle with a spire (shikara). The image of the deity is enshrined under the eaves in the sanctum. There are two Tara images in the sanctum. The stone image of Tara depicted as a mother suckling Shiva – the “primordial image” (seen in the inset of the fierce form of the image of Tara) is camouflaged by a three feet metal image, that the devotee normally seen. It represents Tara in her fiery form with four arms, wearing a garland of skulls and a protruding tongue. Crowned with a silver crown and with flowing hair, the outer image wrapped in a sari and decked in marigold garlands with a silver umbrella over its head. The forehead of the metal image is adorned with red kumkum(vermilion). Priests take a speck of this kumkum and apply it on the foreheads of the devotees as a mark of Tara’s blessings. The devotees offer coconuts, bananas and silk saris, and unusually bottles of whisky. The primordial image of Tara has been described as a “dramatic Hindu image of Tara’s gentler aspect”.
The priests of the temple offer puja (worship) with great reverence to bring out her motherly aspect to the devotees, blending the North Indian fierce depiction of the Sati myth of the goddess with the peaceful motherly visionary form of Tara seen by Buddha and his disciple Vasishtha of the Tantric tradition – the Buddhist Tara form. At Tarapith, though the softer motherly aspect of the fierce goddess is emphasized. Chanting hymns or poems in her praise is also a part of the devotional appeal made to the goddess.
The devotees take a holy bath at the sacred tank adjacent to the temple before entering the temple premises to offer worship and even after the worship. The waters of the tank are said to have healing powers and even restore life to the dead.
Blood sacrifice of goats is the daily norm in the temple. Devotees who offer such goat sacrifices seek blessings from the deity. They bathe the goats in the holy tank near the temple before the sacrifice. They also purify themselves by taking bath in the holy tank before offering worship to the deity. The goat is then tethered to a stake, the designated post in a sand pit, and the neck of the goat butchered with a single stroke by a special sword. A small quantity of the blood of the goat is then collected in a vessel and offered to the deity in the temple. The devotees also smear their forehead with a bit of blood from the pit, as a mark of reverence to the deity.
There are several legends narrated on the origin and importance of this place, all related to the goddess Tara deified in the Tarapith temple. A well-known legend relates to the Shakti Piths. Sati, the consort of Shiva, felt insulted when her father Dakshadid not invite Shiva to the great yajña “fire sacrifice” he organized. Unable to bear this humiliation, Sati gave up her life by jumping into the yajña fire. Infuriated by this tragic turn of events, Shiva went wild. Then, Vishnu, in order to pacify Shiva, decimated the body of Sati with his chakram. Sati’s body part fell all over the Indian subcontinent. The places where the body parts fell have become centres of worship of the Goddess in different manifestations. There are 51 such holy temples which are called Shakti Piths; in West Bengal, there are many such piths, such as the Kalighat.
Vashistha had seen this form and worshipped the goddess Sati in the form of Tara. Another legend narrates: Shiva had drunk the poison that had emerged by the churning of the cosmic oceans, to save the universe. To relieve the intense burning in his throat, Sati – in the form of Tara – breast fed Shiva to relieve him of the effect of poison in his throat. Another local narration is that Vasishtha chose this place for the worship of Sati as it was already known as a Tarapith. Among piths, Tarapith is a siddha pith, which grants enlightenment, wisdom, happiness and siddhis (“supernatural powers”).[10]
Another oral legend about the temple states that sage Vashishtha practised austerities to Tara, but was unsuccessful, so on the advice of a divine voice, he went to meet the Buddha – an avatar of Vishnu according to some schools of Hinduism – in Tibet. The Buddha instructed Vasishtha to worship Tara through the practices of vamachara. During this time, Buddha had a vision of Tarapith as an ideal location for enshrining the image of Tara in a temple there. Buddha advised Vasishtha to go to Tarapith, the abode of Tara. At Tarapith, Vasishtha did penance by reciting Tara mantra 300,000 times. Tara was pleased with Vasishtha’s penance and appeared before him. Vasishtha appealed to Tara to appear before him in the form of a mother suckling Shiva on her breast, the form that Buddha had seen in his divine vision. Tara then incarnated herself in that form before Vasishtha and turned into a stone image. Since then Tara is worshipped in the Tarapith temple in the form of a mother suckling Shiva on her breast.
Tarapith, Kalighat and Nabadwip are considered the most important tirthas (holy places with a sacred water body) for Bengali Hindus.

The turret also contains terracotta carvings. Its decorative scheme is similar to that of the terracotta temples, situated in Bishnupur. Bansberia’s importance in pre-Muslim Bengal was religious, owing to its location at the Tribeni or confluence of three rivers (Ganga, Jamuna, and Saraswati). After Muslim occupation in the late 13th century, it continued to be an important city under the Tughlaks, as a military base, mint-town and port.

Dakshineswar Kali Temple is a Hindu temple located in Dakshineswar near Kolkata. Situated on the eastern bank of the Hooghly River, the presiding deity of the temple is Bhavatarini, an aspect of Kali, meaning, ‘She who liberates Her devotees from the ocean of existence i.e. Saṃsāra’.The temple was built in 1855 by Rani Rashmoni, a philanthropist and a devotee of Kali. The temple is famous for its association with Ramakrishna, a mystic of 19th Century Bengal.
The temple compound, apart from the nine-spired main temple, contains a large courtyard surrounding the temple, with rooms along the boundary walls. There are twelve shrines dedicated to Shiva—Kali’s companion—along the riverfront, a temple to Radha-Krishna, a bathing ghat on the river, a shrine dedicated to Rani Rashmoni. ‘Nahabat’, the chamber in the northwestern corner just beyond the last of the Shiva temples, is where Ramakrishna spent a considerable part of his life.
Built in the traditional ‘Nava-ratna’ or nine spires style of Bengal architecture, the three-storeyed south-facing temple has nine spires distributed in upper two storeys, and stands on a high platform with a flight of stairs, overall it measures 46 feet (14 m) square and rises over 100 feet (30 m) high.
The garbha griha (sanctum sanctorum) houses an idol of goddess Kali, known as Bhavatarini, standing on the chest of a supine Shiva, and the two idols are placed on a thousand-petaled lotus made of silver.
Close to the main temple are the row of twelve identical Shiva temples built facing the east in the typical aat-chala Bengal architecture, they are built on either side of the ghat on the Hooghly river. To the North east of the Temple Complex is the Vishnu Temple or the Radha Kanta Temple. A flight of steps lead to the columned verandah and into the temple where a silver throne rests with a 21 1⁄2-inch (550 mm) idol of Lord Krishna and a 16-inch (410 mm) idol of Radha.
The Dakshineswar Kali Temple was founded around the middle of the 19th century by Rani Rashmoni.Rani Rashmoni was a Mahishya by caste and was well known for her philanthropic activities. In the year 1847, Rashmoni, prepared to go upon a long pilgrimage to the sacred Hindu city of Kashi to express her devotions to the Divine Mother. Rani was to travel in twenty four boats, carrying relatives, servants and supplies.According to traditional accounts, the night before the pilgrimage began, Rashmoni had a vision of the Divine Mother, in the form of the goddess Kali in a dream and reportedly said There is no need to go to Banaras. Install my statue in a beautiful temple on the banks of the Ganges river and arrange for my worship there. Then I shall manifest myself in the image and accept worship at that place.
Profoundly affected by the dream, Rani immediately looked for and purchased a 20-acred plot in the village of Dakshineswar. The large temple complex was built between 1847 and 1855. The 20-acre (81,000 m2) plot was bought from an Englishman, John Hastie and was then popularly known as Saheban Bagicha,[8] partly old Muslim burial ground shaped like a tortoise, considered befitting for the worship of Shakti according to Tantra traditions, it took eight years and nine hundred thousand rupees to complete the construction, and finally the idol of Goddess Kali was installed on the Snana Yatra day on 31 May 1855, amid festivities at the temple formally known as Sri Sri Jagadishwari Mahakali, with Ramkumar Chhattopadhyay as the head priest; soon his younger brother Gadai or Gadadhar (later known as Ramakrishna) moved in and so did nephew Hriday to assist him.On 31 May 1855 more than 1 lakh Brahmins were invited from different parts of the country to grace the auspicious occasion. The next year, Ramkumar Chattopadhyay died, the position was given to Ramakrishna, along with his wife Sarada Devi, who stayed in the south side of the Nahabat (music room), in a small room on the ground floor, which now a shrine dedicated to her.
From then until his death 30 years later in 1886, Ramakrishna was responsible for bringing much in the way of both fame and pilgrims to the temple.
Rani Rashmoni lived only for five years and nine months after the inauguration of the temple. She seriously fell ill in 1861. Realizing that her death was near she decided to handover the property she purchased in Dinajpur (now in Bangladesh) as a legacy for the maintenance of the temple to the temple trust. She accomplished her task on 18 February 1861 and died on the next day.After her death in 1861, her sons-in-law took to celebrating Durga Puja in their respective premises.
Dakshineswar Temple is located at a distance of 20 km north from the central part of Kolkata. It is located alongside the Vivekananda Bridge. The temple admires the eastern bank of River Hooghly.

https://www.bharattemples.com/kalighat-kali-temple-kolkata-west-bengal/,"Kalighat Kali Temple, Kolkata, West Bengal
Kalighat Kali Temple is a Hindu temple in West Bengal, India dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kali. It is one of the 51 Shakti Peethas.
Kalighat was a Ghat (landing stage) sacred to Kali on the old course of the Hooghly river (Bhāgirathi) in the city of Calcutta. The name Calcutta is said to have been derived from the word Kalighat. The river over a period of time has moved away from the temple. The temple is now on the banks of a small canal called Adi Ganga which connects to the Hoogly. The Adi Ganga was the original course of the river Hoogly. Hence the name Adi (original) Ganga.
The Temple at Kalighat is revered as an important Shakti Peetha, by the Shaktism sect of Hinduism. The mythology of Daksha yajna and Sati’s self immolation is the story behind the origin of Shakti Peethas.
Daksha, the son of Brahma was an ancient entity called Prajapati or the keeper of the beings in Hinduism. He had a lot of daughters, one of whom was Sati, an incarnation of the Primordial Mother Goddess or Shakti. She was married to Shiva, the ascetic, whose abode was in the cold and snowy recesses of the Kailasa Parvat. Daksha had frowned upon the marriage, as Shiva was a penniless man, quite unlike the King that Daksha was. In time, Daksha decided that he would arrange a yajna or a ritual where he would invite all the gods, except for Shiva. Sati, his daughter came to her father’s place, uninvited and faced a flurry of insults from her father about her husband. Unable to bear the insults, she immolated herself. The news of the death of his beloved wife set Shiva on a delirious rage, as he started the Tandav or the Dance of Destruction with the body of Sati, calming down, only when Vishnu managed to chop her body down into fifty one pieces, which would fall all over the length and breadth of India. (A lot of these places are in modern day Pakistan and Bangladesh as well.)
Shakti Peethas or divine seats of Shakti or the Primordial Mother Goddess, thus came into being wherever these severed parts of Sati’s body had fallen.
Each of the 51 Peethas have a temple dedicated to the Shakti or the Primordial Mother, and a temple dedicated to the Bhairava or Shiva, the All-Father, essentially forming important historical centres to mark the marriage of Shaivism and Shaktism, and also the philosophical fact that a man is nothing without his Shakti or Woman and vice versa.
The Shakti here is thus Dakshina Kali (the benevolent Mother of the World) while the Bhairav being Nakulish or Nakuleshwar.
It is believed that the right big toe of Sati fell here at Kalighat. However, some Puranas also mention that the Mukha Khanda (face) of the Goddess fell here, got fossilized, and is stored and worshipped here.
The 51 Shakti Peethas are linked to the 51 alphabets in Sanskrit, each carrying the power to invoke one of the goddesses associated with them. These Alphabets are called Beeja Mantras or the seeds of the primordial sounds of creation. The Beeja Mantra for Dakshina Kali is Krīm.
The mythological texts which include the Kalika Purana (Ashtashakti,) recognize the four major Shakti Peethas — Bimala where resides the Pada Khanda (feet) (the temple is inside the Jagannath Temple, Puri, Odisha), Tara Tarini housing the Stana Khanda (Breasts), (near Brahmapur, Odisha), Kamakshya, Yoni khanda (vagina) (near Guwahati, Assam) and Dakshina Kalika, Mukha khanda (in Kolkata, West Bengal) originated from the lifeless body of the goddess Sati.
The Kalighat temple in its present form is only about 200 years old, although it has been referred to in Mansar Bhasan composed in the 15th century, and in Kavi Kankan Chandi of the 17th century.The present structure of the temple was completed under the Sabarna Roy Chowdhury family’s patronage in 1809. Mention of the Kali temple is also found in Lalmohon Bidyanidhis’s ‘Sambanda Nirnoy”.Only two types of coins of Chandragupta II, who incorporated Vanga in the Gupta Empire, are known from Bengal. His Archer type coins, which became the most popular type of coinage with the Gupta rulers after Kumaragupta I, have been found in Kalighat. This is evidence of the antiquity of the place.The image of Kali in this temple is unique. It does not follow the pattern of other Kali images in Bengal. The present idol of touchstone was created by two saints – Atmaram Brahmachari and Brahmananda Giri. Presently, the three huge eyes, long protruding tongue made of gold and four hands, which all are made of gold too. Two of these hands holding a scimitar and a severed head of the asura king ‘Shumbha’. The scimitar signifies Divine Knowledge and the asura (or, human) head signifies human Ego which must be slain by Divine Knowledge in order to attain Moksha. The other two hands are in the abhaya and varada mudras or blessings, which means her initiated devotees (or anyone worshiping her with a true heart) will be saved as she will guide them here and hereafter.
Kalighat is regarded as one of the 51 Shakti Peethas of India, where the various parts of Sati’s body are said to have fallen, in the course of Shiva’s Rudra Tandava. Kalighat represents the site where the toes of the right foot of Dakshayani or Sati fell.
Kalighat is also associated with the worship offered to Kali by a Dasanami Monk by name Chowranga Giri, and the Chowringee area of Calcutta is said to have been named after him.

Sammakka Saralamma Jatara or Medaram Jatara is a festival of honouring the goddesses celebrated in the state of Telangana, India. This Jatara is known for witnessing one of the largest people gatherings in the world. People offer Bangarm (jaggery) :The Jatara begins at Medaram in Tadvai mandal in Jayashankar Bhupalpally district. The rituals related to the Goddesses are entirely conducted by Koya tribe priests, in accordance with Koya customs and traditions.
Medaram is a remote place in the Eturnagaram Wildlife Sanctuary, a part of Dandakaranya, the largest surviving forest belt in the Deccan.
Jatara is celebrated during the time the goddesses of the tribals are believed to visit them. It is believed that after Kumbha Mela, the Medaram jatara attracts the largest number of devotees in the country.it is very Asia’s largest tribal festival which is celebrated in telangana
The Sammakka-Saralamma jatara, a biennial tribal festival, marks the sacrifice by Sammakka and Saralamma — a mother-daughter duo – against the powerful Kakatiya rulers’ unjust tax law. The four-day tribal festival begins at Medaram in Jayashankar Bhupalapalli district and attracts millions of people. This year, the jatara is celebrated from January 31 to February 3.
According to a tribal legend, about seven centuries ago, the Koya tribals found a little girl playing with tigers while passing through the Dandakaranya forest. The tribal chief adopted her and named her Sammakka.
She married Pagididda Raju, headman of a neighbouring village, and begot three children –Jampanna, Nagulamma and Saaralamma. The Koyas were under the tutelage of the Kakatiyas, who ruled Central India from Warangal City between 1000 AD and 1380 AD.
During a severe drought that lasted years, the mighty Godavari dried up and the Koyas fell  on hard times. Though the Kakatiya rulers’ insisted on them paying the tax, it was beyond the means of the Koyas. Kakatiya Emperor Pratapa Rudra sent forces to teach the Koyas a lesson. This was resisted by the Koyas. In the bitter war, most of the Koya chieftains lost.
Samakka resolved to continue the fight to avenge the dead and was wounded. Samakka told her people that as long as they remembered her, she would protect them. Then, she cursed the Kakatiya dynasty and disappeared into the forest.
Legends say that the tribals searched for their queen and found a red ochre box, containing her bangles, and the pug-mark of a tigress. Since then, the Koyas, Waddaras and other tribes and non-tribals have been holding feasts in memory of Sammakka and Saralamma.
Sammakka-Saralamma jatara is held in over 100 tribal locations in Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.
There are many legends about the miraculous powers of Sammakka. According to a tribal story, about 6-7 centuries ago, that is in the 13th century, some tribal leaders who went for a hunting found a new born girl (Sammakka) emitting enormous light playing amidst tigers. She was taken to their habitation, and the head of the tribe adopted her and brought up as a chief. She later became the saviour of the tribals of the region. She was married to Pagididda Raju, a feudatory tribal chief of Kakatiyas (who ruled the country of Telugus from Warangal City between 1000 AD and 1380 AD). She was blessed with 2 daughters and one son namely Sarakka, Nagulamma and Jampanna respectively. Jampanna died in this attack and fell bleeding into a vaagu (stream) and later the whole sampangi vaagu has turned red due to which it was later on called JAMPANNA VAAGU near the place where the present mela is taking place.
Hyderabad to Medaram Jatara distance is about 180 KM. From Warangal, it is 90 KM journey.

The temple is believed to be built in 625 A.D by the King Pulakeshin II of Chalukya dynasty to commemorate his victory over Vengi region of Andhra Desham, as per the writings on the temple wall.
Kakatiya kings later have adopted the temple and considered Goddess Bhadrakali as their “Kula Devatha”. A lake was also built by Ganapati deva adjacent to the temple. Due to the fall of Kakatiya dynasty to the Muslim rulers of Delhi, the temple lost its prominence. Allauddin Khilji destroyed the temple and looted the koh-i-noor diamond, which was in crown of the goddess bhadrakali murti. In 1950, the temple was renovated by Sri Ganapathi Sastri a devi upasaka along with the help of a local merchant and other affluent locals .Apara Ekadashi is observed as Goddess Bhadrakali Ekadashi.The history of the Koh-i-Noor diamond; part of British Crown Jewels, is closely associated with this temple as it was installed, as the left eye of Goddess Bhadrakali by the Kakatiya dynasty.

The temple structure is supported by square pillars a unique style statement used by the kings of the Chalukya dynasty. Several other features of the temple and the main deity bear the signature stamp of the Chalukyas. Some of these include the main deity displaying the Ekanda Shila or single stone sculpture style unique to the Chalukyas.
The temple also displays a strong resemblance to the Kakatiya style of architecture as well particularly in its stone entrance gateways. It is also known that the Kakatiya rulers were responsible for construction of a road leading up to the temple as well as the lake that surrounds the temple premises. This has led to the conclusion that the temple though constructed under the Chalukyas was also heavily influenced by the Kakatiyas when it moved into their hands at one point of time in its history.
There is a Sanskrit inscription on one of the inner pillars (called as Antralaya stambam) at Bhadrakali Temple Warangal.

He selected this beautiful valley surrounded by hills and verdant greenery for the purpose and ordered Hanuman to bring a Sivlingam from Varanasi. Hanuman was late in arriving with the Siva lingam and as the auspicious hour was nearing, Lord Siva himself appeared before Sri Rama and presented a Sivilingam for installation. Hence the lingam in the temple is called Swayambhu Linga. It is also called Ramalingeswara as lord Sri Rama had installed the lingam.
Hanuman returned with 101 lingams for selection from Varanasi and felt aggrieved at not having his lingam installed. Hence he threw them all over the area. Even to this day several lingams are found scattered all over the place outside the temple.
To mollify Hanuman, Sri Rama ordained that precedence would be given to him for worship at the temple. He also said that the hillock where the lingam was installed would bear his name kesarigiri that is, Hanuman, the son of Kesari. Over a period of time, it has colloquially transformed and is now known as Keesara and the hill as Keesaragutta. Ever since, the rituals follow the command of Sri Rama.

https://www.bharattemples.com/sita-ramachandraswamy-temple-bhadrachalam-telangana/,"The Sri Sita Ramachandraswamy temple is a South Indian Hindu temple dedicated to Rama, the seventh incarnation of the god Vishnu. It is located on the shores of the Godavari River in the town of Bhadrachalam, a part of the Bhadradri Kothagudem district in Telangana state. Often simply referred to as Bhadrachalam or Bhadradri, the temple is considered one of the Divya Kshetrams of Godavari and is also revered as Dakshina Ayodhya. According to the legend, Vishnu appeared to Meru‘s son Bhadra as Rama to answer the latter’s prayers. However, Vishnu forgot that Rama was a mortal human and appeared as Vaikuntha Rama with four hands. Sita and Lakshmana form part of the temple’s moolavar.
The self-manifested moolavar was discovered in the 17th century by Pokala Dhammakka, a tribal woman living in Bhadrareddypalem. After she built a mandapam for the idols, Bhadrachalam’s tehsildar Kancherla Gopanna constructed this temple during the reign of Abul Hasan Qutb Shah. After Gopanna, Tumu Lakshmi Narasimha Dasu and Varada Ramadasu looked after the temple’s rituals. Bhadrachalam follows the Vaishnavite Pancharatra Agama tradition, and its system of worship is modelled on that of the Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam. The temple has four entrances; the Rajagopuram is located at the northern entrance, which is called the Vaikuntha Dwaram. The temple houses a number of sub-shrines and a few mandapams.
Bhadrachalam is notable for its principal deity Vaikuntha Rama, a form of Rama not found anywhere else in the country. According to the Brahma Purana, the temple’s deity is capable of imparting knowledge to those who worship him. Gopanna used Bhadrachalam as a centre of the Bhajan tradition to spread awareness of the Vaishnavite tradition. The annual Brahmotsavam is the biggest festival celebrated in Bhadrachalam; the key event is the Sri Sitarama Thirukalyana Mahotsavam, or the marriage of Rama and Sita on the eve of Sri Rama Navami. Other important festivals celebrated in Bhadrachalam are Vaikuntha Ekadashi, Vasanthotsavam, and Vijayadashami.
The Sita Ramachandraswamy Temple has a rich history that dates back to the 17th century. The temple was built by Kancharla Gopanna, who was a revenue officer under the rule of Tani Shah of Golconda. Kancharla Gopanna was a devout devotee of Lord Rama and spent a significant portion of his revenue on the construction of the temple.
The Sita Ramachandraswamy Temple is considered to be one of the most significant temples in Telangana. The temple is dedicated to Lord Rama, his consort Sita, and his brother Lakshmana. The temple is also known as the Bhadrachalam temple and is believed to be the place where Lord Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana stayed during their exile.
The temple is also famous for its association with the famous Telugu poet-composer Kshetrayya. It is believed that Kshetrayya used to sing his compositions in the temple and was a devout follower of Lord Rama.
In the 17th century CE, Pokala Dhammakka, a tribal woman living in Bhadrareddypalem, found the central icon of Rama in an anthill. She dissolved the anthill using the water from the Godavari River. With the help of the villagers, Dhammakka constructed a mandapam (hall) and offered prayers to the deities.  During the reign of Abul Hasan Qutb Shah (1672-1686), Kancherla Gopanna served as the tehsildar(revenue officer) of Bhadrachalam. Gopanna was given the title of Ramadas (Rama’s servant) by Kabirdas, a Muslim saint who was impressed with his charity. Following the Shah’s orders, Gopanna enforced the Jaziya tax, a penalty designed to force Hindus to adopt Islam.Observing the dilapidated state of the temple, Gopanna decided to build a temple for the deity by raising donations. In the initial attempt, Gopanna received harsh criticism from the local Hindus for enforcing the tax. Dejected by numerous rebuffs, Gopanna decided to use a portion of the tax collected to build the temple and face the consequences.
The temple was completed at a cost of nearly six lakh varahas. After learning the truth, the Shah was enraged, and Gopanna was summoned to the court. Gopanna explained that he never intended to misuse the treasury funds and planned to reimburse using donations he expected to receive in the future. The Shah ordered his soldiers to hang Gopanna if the sum was not repaid within twelve years, and imprisoned him. On the last day of the twelfth year, Rama and Lakshmana appeared in Shah’s dream and repaid the entire sum in Rama madas (gold coins with Rama’s inscriptions on them). When the Shah woke up, he saw real gold coins and released Gopanna. He gave Gopanna a pension for life and donated the area around Bhadrachalam as an endowment to the temple Some scholars dismissed the idea of Rama paying the money, saying that the Shah had held a fair and impartial inquiry, found Gopanna innocent, and exonerated him with due Honour.
Years later, Tumu Lakshmi Narasimha Dasu of Guntur and his friend Varada Ramadasu of Kanchipuram offered prayers daily at Bhadrachalam and spent their life there. After Varada Ramadasu’s death, Narasimha Dasu carried his corpse into the Godavari and died by drowning.
The temple was a part of the Godavari district until the end of the Visalandhra movement, after which the town was merged into Khammam district in 1956. The temple’s maintenance and administration were undertaken by the endowment ministry of the Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1958. Repairs were made to the temple in 1960 under the supervision of the then-endowments minister Kalluri Chandramouli.
In August 1986 the temple faced a severe threat from flash floods in the Godavari River. The main streets and several structures, including cottages, were submerged in water for nearly five days. Many local people took shelter in the halls of the temple. The kalyana mandapam (marriage hall) was completely inundated except for its gopuram (temple tower). P. Seshacharyulu and other priests stayed in the temple and performed all the daily rituals without any interruption during the floods.
The Nizam of Hyderabad, Mir Osman Ali Khan during his time made a huge donation of Rs. 50,000 for this temple during his time.
During the Telangana movement, both the states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh claimed that the Bhadrachalam temple belongs to their respective regions. Telangana politicians and activists stood firm on their stance and stated that they would not let Bhadrachalam be separated from the state.Bhadrachalam was retained in Telangana, and after reorganisation of districts in October 2016, the temple became a part of Bhadradri Kothagudem district.
The Sita Ramachandraswamy Temple is known for its vibrant festivals and rituals, which are celebrated with great fervor and enthusiasm. The most significant festival celebrated in the temple is the annual Sri Rama Navami festival, which is celebrated in the month of Chaitra (March-April). The festival is celebrated for nine days and attracts thousands of devotees from all over the country.
Other important festivals celebrated in the temple include the Hanuman Jayanti, Diwali, and Dussehra. The temple also hosts several poojas and rituals throughout the year, which are performed by the temple priests.
According to Hindu legend, in the Treta Yuga, Rama (avatar of the god Vishnu), along with his consort Sita and brother Lakshmana, stayed in the Dandaka forest as a part of their fourteen-year exile.Due to Rama’s grace, a stone turned into a human called Bhadra, who was considered the son of Mount Meru. Devoted to Rama, Bhadra later met the sage Narada, who initiated an upadesam (instruction) of the Rama Taraka mantra. Bhadra mediated and chanted the mantra on the banks of the Godavari River for several years.Pleased, Rama promised to return to meet Bhadra when he had found Sita, who had been abducted by the demon king Ravana. However, Rama failed to fulfill his promise in his lifetime.
Later, Vishnu was pleased with Bhadra’s devotion and appeared before Bhadra in the form of Rama. In a hurry, Vishnu forgot that Rama was a mortal with two arms and appeared with his four celestial arms.Rama in upper arms held a shankha (conch) and the Sudarshana Chakra (discus) and a bow and an arrow in his lower hands. Sita was seated on his left thigh and Lakshmana stood to his left. All three faced west towards the Godavari River.Rama held the conch in his right upper hand in contrast to Vishnu, with the intention of giving salvation to Bhadra.
Rama turned Bhadra into a hillock; the images of the deities in the same postures manifested at its summit.The hillock was referred to as Bhadrachalam or Bhadradri (“Bhadra’s hill”). The central icon of Rama is referred by various epithets. Since Rama descended from Vaikuntha (Vishnu’s abode) and manifested there, he was called “Vaikuntha Rama”. As the deity is four-armed like Vishnu (Narayana), he was named “Rama Narayana”. The trio of deities together signified the aspects of the sacred sound Om, which earned Rama the sobriquet of “Om-kara Rama”.
The Sita Ramachandraswamy Temple is located in the heart of Bhadrachalam, Telangana. The nearest airport to Bhadrachalam is the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad, which is located approximately 300 km from Bhadrachalam.

Sitaram Bagh temple or Seetharambagh temple, built by Seth Puranmal Ganeriwala, member of the Ganeriwala family, is an old temple located in Mangalhat, a suburb of Hyderabad.It is spread over 25 acres. Sitaram Bagh temple is classified as a heritage building by INTACH. The 7th Nizam of Hyderabad HEH Mir Osman Ali Khan made a huge donation towards re-construction of this temple.
The Sitarambagh temple is built over 25 acres and has a 50-feet wall, giving the temple a fort like look. In these days and times, it keeps the encroachers out, but there was a time when it protected Hindu women from Razakars. That is the time 10,000 Hindu women took shelter at the temple. “We protected them and the food was supplied at the temple,” says Arvind Ganeriwal.
The temple is equipped with six step wells of which one is defunct. Not surprisingly, there are three mosques around the temple. The property includes an old Qutub Shahi mosque with a step well, near which Puranmalji constructed the temple complex.
The Ganga-Jamni tehzeeb for which Hyderabad is still famous must have existed till the Razakar movement, for, presumably, after that a wall was built to separate the mosque from the temple, though both of them still use the water from the same stepwell.
The Sitarambagh temple has a shrine dedicated to Lord Hanuman. The vigraha (idol) that you see now is a discovery even for the family members.“We had been worshipping Hanuman only till the knee,” said Arvindji, “not knowing that the rest had been buried over a period of time.”
Sitaram Bagh temple or Seetharambagh temple is an old temple located in Mangalghat, a suburb of Hyderabad. This is one of the oldest Hindu Temple in Hyderabad dedicated to Lord Rama and his wife Sita.
It is listed as a heritage building by INTACH.Thanks to my friend Rajesh Pamnani, we got access to shoot the temple’s celebrations to mark its 180th year.
This Temple was built by Puranmal Ganeriwala, in the 1830s. Its architecture style is a mixture of Rajasthani, Mughal and European. It was constructed during the regime of Qutub Shahi Kings. It was supported by the Nizams. There is a 20 feet’s high wall surrounding this temple and thus it looks like a fort. The major area of this temple is dedicated to open scrub and the minor one is to the complex of temples, samadhis and residential quarters. The courtyard presents a new facet, style, structure and one would be thrilled to see it with surprises.
The major sanctum sanctorum of Lord Rama and Sita is carved through marbles and there are also shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva, Lord Hanuman, Goddess Lakshmi, and Varadarajaswamy within the temple.

https://www.bharattemples.com/hanuman-temple-hyderabad-telangana/,"Hanuman Temple, Hyderabad, Telangana
The Karmanghat Hanuman Temple is one of the oldest and popular Hindu temples in Hyderabad, in the state of Telangana, India. The presiding deity of the temple is Lord Hanuman and the temple complex also houses other deities viz. Lord Rama, Lord Shiva, Goddess Saraswathi, Goddess Durga, Goddess Santoshimata, Lord Venugopala Swamy, and Lord Jagannath. The temple is located at Karmanghat, near Santoshnagar and closer to the Nagarjuna Sagar Ring Road.
This famous temple in Karmanghat was constructed in the 12th century A.D. according to the legend, when a Kakatiya ruler who was hunting after some time in the forest, felt tired and sat down to take rest under a tree. While resting, the king heard someone chanting the name of Lord Rama, the king got interested and went around trying to find who it was and as he walked further deep into the forest, he discovered an idol of Lord Hanuman. The stone idol was in a sitting posture and the voice was coming from within the vigraham. Having paid his respects, the humble king returned to his capital, and that very night, Lord Hanuman appeared in his dream and asked the king to construct a temple.
The Karmanghat Temple was constructed immediately and the succeeding kings of the Kakatiya dynasty ruled it well. Some 400 years later, Aurangzeb had ordered his armies to each and every corner of the country to destroy all Hindus temples. At this temple, Aurangazeb’s mighty armies could not even enter near the compound wall. After learning this, Aurangzeb, himself went there to wipe out the temple with a with a crow bar in his hand. When he reached the temple premises, he heard a deafening roar rumbling and the instrument slipped from his hands as fear overwhelmed him. Then he heard a thundering voice from the heavens saying Mandir todna hai raja, to kar maan ghat” which means, oh king, if you want to destroy this temple, then make your heart strong. The place got its name kar-man-ghat, after the voice from the heavens. And to this day, the main deity Lord Anjaneya sits in the temple peacefully meditating and bestows his blessing to his devotees, as Dhyana Anjaneya Swamy.Eight and a half centuries old Hanuman temple was built by the famous Kakatiya ruler Prataparudra II around 1143 AD in Lakshmigudem which was now called as Karmanghat village.

Generally temple gets heavy rush on Fridays and Sundays.Temple at Chilkur is managed by the hereditary trustee Sri M.V. Soundara Rajan and Sri C.S. Gopala Krishna. The entire family of the archaka, including the women are dedicated themselves to serve the God.
Chilkur Balaji Temple, popularly known as “Visa Balaji Temple”, is an ancient Hindu temple of Lord Balaji on the banks of Osman Sagar in Hyderabad. It is one of the oldest temples in Hyderabad built during the time of Madanna and Akkanna, the uncles of Bhakta Ramadas.
This temple has no hundi and neither accepts any money from devotees. VAK Books also known as the Voice of Temples with religious news is available here. This is one of the special Temples in India with no green channel or privileges for VIP’s.The only other such temple is the Jalaram temple in Virpur (Rajkot), Gujarat. This temple fought and won the right to stay out of government control. The only another such temple is “Ramanuj Kot”, a temple in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.
 
Twenty Five kilometers from Hyderabad off the Vikarabad road and on the banks of Osmansagar is the picturesque village of Chikur with its hoary temple dedicated to Sri Balaji Venkateshwara. From the style, structure and appearance, it can be inferred that the temple was built half a millennium ago. Set in sylvan surroundings, the temple attracts thousands of pilgrims every year and is an ideal place for sequestered retreat and meditation. It enjoyed in the past, great days of pomp and glory.
The temple is one of the oldest in Telengana, having been built during the time of Akkanna and Madanna, the uncles of Bhakta Ramdas. According to tradition, a devotee who used to visit Tirupati every year could not do so on one occasion owing to serious ill-health. Lord Venkateshwara appeared in his dream and said, “I am right here in the jungle nearby. You don’t have to worry.” The devotee at once moved to the place indicated by the Lord in the dream and saw a mole- hill there, which he dug up. Accidentally, the axe struck Lord Balaji’s idol covered by the mole-hill below the chin and on the chest, and surprisingly blood started flowing profusely from the “wounds”, flooding the ground and turning it scarlet. The devotee could not believe his eyes when he saw this. Suddenly he could not believe his ears also when he heard a voice from the air which said,”Flood the mole-hill with cow’s milk. “When the devotee did so, a Swayambhu idol of Lord Balaji accompanied by Sridevi and Bhoodevi(a rare combination) was found, and this idol was installed with the due rites and a temple built for it.
Sri Balaji venkateshwara, the Pratyaksha Daiva in kaliyuga, is thus available at Chilkur to shower blessings on His devotees who for any reason are unable to go to Tirupati. Many devout worshippers flock to the temple, to receive the blessings of the Lord and his consorts throughout the year particularly during the Poolangi, Annakota and Brahmothsavams
With the earnest desire to revive the former glory and importance of the temple, the idol of Ammavaru was installed in 1963 the year following the Chinese aggression, and when the aggression was unilaterally vacated, Ammavaru was given the name of Rajya Lakshmi, signifying this welcome event. The unique feature of this idol is that lotus flowers are held in three hands and the fourth hand is in such a position towards the lotus feet which signifies the doctrine of Saranagathi.
The temple has been visited by great Acharyas from time to time. A visit to the temple is a must for the Jeer of Sri Ahobila Mutt every time he visits the twin cities, and in the temple is installed the idol of the first Jeer. The Tilakayaths of Sri Vallabhacharya Sampradaya have been regularly visiting the shrine.
